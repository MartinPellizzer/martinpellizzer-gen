    "intro": "Oncidium monachicum, commonly known as the monk's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, showy inflorescences that often feature a mix of yellow, orange, and brown hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers bloom in clusters and can last for several weeks, making it a popular choice for ornamental cultivation. Oncidium monachicum requires bright, indirect light and well-draining potting media to thrive."
