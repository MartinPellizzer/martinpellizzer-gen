It is characterized by its striking, bee-mimicking flowers that play a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its floral structure includes a complex labellum that mimics the appearance and scent of female bees. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique hybrid origins and ecological adaptations."
