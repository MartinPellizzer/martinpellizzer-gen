    "intro": "Oedochloa mayarensis, commonly known as the Mayari grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain both male and female flowers, making it monoecious. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or riparian habitats. Oedochloa mayarensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
