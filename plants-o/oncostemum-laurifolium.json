    "intro": "Oncostemum laurifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf oncostemum, is a tropical shrub native to Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes in tropical regions."
