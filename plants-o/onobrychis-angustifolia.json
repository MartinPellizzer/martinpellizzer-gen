    "intro": "Onobrychis angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf burr medic, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces burrs that contain seeds, which are adapted for wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration and as a forage crop."
