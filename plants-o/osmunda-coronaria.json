    "intro": "Osmunda coronaria, commonly known as the royal fern, is a perennial aquatic fern native to wetlands and marshes in North America. It has a distinctive, upright, tree-like appearance with a central trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, and its rhizomes form dense colonies that help stabilize the surrounding environment. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces both sexually and vegetatively. Osmunda coronaria plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
