    "intro": "Ophioglossum litorale, commonly known as the water adder or sea adder, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant found in wetland habitats. It has a distinctive, creeping rhizome with a unique, spore-bearing structure called a sporangium. The plant produces a single, lance-shaped leaf that can grow up to 1 meter in length. Its spores are released from the sporangium, which is located at the base of the leaf. Ophioglossum litorale is considered a living fossil due to its primitive morphology and evolutionary significance."
