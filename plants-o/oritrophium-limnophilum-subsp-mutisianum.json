    "intro": "Oritrophium limnophilum subsp. mutisianum, commonly known as the water-loving coneflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, violet-blue ray flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist to aquatic environments, often found along the edges of ponds and lakes. Its root system is adapted to waterlogged soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing shorelines. The subspecies mutisianum is distinguished by its slightly different flower morphology compared to the main species."
