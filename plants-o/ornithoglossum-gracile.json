    "intro": "Ornithoglossum gracile, commonly known as the slender orchid or slender tongue plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its striking, orchid-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, tuberous roots that help it survive in its alpine habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is considered rare in the wild."
