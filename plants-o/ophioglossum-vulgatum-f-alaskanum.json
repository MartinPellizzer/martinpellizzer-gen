    "intro": "Ophioglossum vulgatum f. alaskanum, commonly known as the Alaska adder's tongue, is a rare fern species native to Alaska and parts of northern Canada. It is characterized by its unique, tongue-shaped spore-producing structure called a sporophyll, which is typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and produces a single, erect leaf that can reach up to 1 meter in length. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and boggy areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
