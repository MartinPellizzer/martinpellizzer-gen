It is a member of the Rhizophoraceae family and is adapted to saline and brackish water environments. The plant typically grows in mangrove forests, where it forms dense thickets that provide habitat for various marine and terrestrial species. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a leathery texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in spikes. Ophiorrhiza robbrechtii plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and preventing erosion."
