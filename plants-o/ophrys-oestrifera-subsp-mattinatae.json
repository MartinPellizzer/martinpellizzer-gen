    "intro": "Ophrys oestrifera subsp. mattinatae, commonly known as the Mattinata orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which includes a complex, bee-mimicking labellum designed to attract pollinators. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. It is a terrestrial orchid with a short, rhizomatous root system and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
