    "intro": "Oerstedella pumila, commonly known as the dwarf sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. It is native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, dry environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, clustered in dense, compact inflorescences. Oerstedella pumila is often found in open, disturbed areas such as dunes, tundra, and rocky outcrops."
