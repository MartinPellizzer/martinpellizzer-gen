    "intro": "Onosma nana, commonly known as dwarf heliotrope, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Onosma nana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its medicinal properties."
