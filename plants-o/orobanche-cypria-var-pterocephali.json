    "intro": "Orobanche cypria var. pterocephali, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, pale yellow or greenish flowers and is often found growing on the roots of various plants in the legume family. The plant has a distinctive root system composed of numerous small, thread-like structures that attach to the host's roots. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is considered a weed in agricultural settings. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of crops."
