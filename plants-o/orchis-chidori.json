    "intro": "Orchis chidori, commonly known as the blue orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Japan, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features tall, slender stems with large, showy blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Due to its limited habitat and endangered status, it is highly valued in botanical conservation efforts."
