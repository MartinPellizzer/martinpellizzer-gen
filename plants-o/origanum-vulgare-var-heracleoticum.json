    "intro": "[WRONG START] Origanum vulgage var. heracleoticum, commonly known as Greek oregano, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly fuzzy leaves that are rich in essential oils, particularly carvacrol and thymol. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in summer, which attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. This variety is widely used in cooking and traditional medicine for its pungent flavor and potential health benefits."
