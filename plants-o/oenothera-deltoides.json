    "intro": "Oenothera deltoides, commonly known as evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that open in the evening, hence its common name. The plant has hairy, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically borne in clusters at the ends of the stems, and the plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Oenothera deltoides is also known for its medicinal uses, particularly for its oil-rich seeds."
