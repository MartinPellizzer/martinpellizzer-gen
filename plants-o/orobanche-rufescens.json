    "intro": "Orobanche rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow or reddish-brown stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in association with leguminous plants. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants."
