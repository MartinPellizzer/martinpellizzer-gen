It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its deltoid-shaped leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. It typically grows in wetlands and along stream banks, preferring moist, sandy soils. Oxypetalum deltoideum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
