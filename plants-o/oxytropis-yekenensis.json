    "intro": "Oxytropis yekenensis, commonly known as the Yeken milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in the summer months. Oxytropis yekenensis is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for livestock in its native habitats."
