    "intro": "Oncinotis mitis, commonly known as the slender false nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Oncinotis mitis is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in supporting local insect populations."
