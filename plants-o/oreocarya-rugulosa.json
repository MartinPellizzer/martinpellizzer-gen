    "intro": "Oreocarya rugulosa, commonly known as the roughleaf buckthorn, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, oval leaves that are typically covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for some bird species. Oreocarya rugulosa thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
