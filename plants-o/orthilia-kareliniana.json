    "intro": "Orthilia kareliniana, commonly known as Karelin's orthilia, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater regions of Russia and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Hydrocharitaceae and is characterized by its branching, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged, followed by fruiting structures that release tiny seeds into the water. It thrives in shallow, still waters with soft, nutrient-rich substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
