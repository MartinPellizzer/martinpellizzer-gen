    "intro": "Ornithidium inflexum, commonly known as the silver leaf orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are covered in a dense layer of silvery-white trichomes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, adding a subtle elegance to its foliage. It thrives in high humidity and partial shade, requiring careful attention to moisture levels and air circulation. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated by enthusiasts in controlled environments."
