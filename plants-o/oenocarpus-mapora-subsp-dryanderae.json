    "intro": "Oenocarpus mapora subsp. dryanderae, commonly known as the coconut palm, is a tall, slender palm native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its large, feather-like leaves and produces a fibrous, spiky fruit that contains a sweet, oily liquid. The plant thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained sandy soils. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility. The coconut palm is widely cultivated for its fruit, oil, and other by-products."
