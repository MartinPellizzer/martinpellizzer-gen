    "intro": "Oxytheca spiculata, commonly known as the spiky oxytheca, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, spiny leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its unique morphology, including the spines and compact growth form, helps it conserve water and deter herbivores. Oxytheca spiculata is often found in open grasslands and along rocky outcrops."
