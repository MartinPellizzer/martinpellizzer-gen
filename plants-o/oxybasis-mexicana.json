It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in riparian zones and wetlands. Oxybasis mexicana is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical applications remain understudied."
