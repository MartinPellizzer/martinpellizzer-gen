    "intro": "Oreogrammitis allocota, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to parts of Asia and Africa. It typically grows on rocky substrates, thriving in humid and shaded environments. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes that help it anchor to rocky surfaces. Its fronds are lance-shaped and often have a dark green color with a slightly hairy texture. Oreogrammitis allocota is known for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and is often found in mountainous regions."
