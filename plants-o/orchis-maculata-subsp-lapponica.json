    "intro": "Orchis maculata subsp. lapponica, commonly known as the Lapland spotted orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in the northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive spotted leaves and pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. This subspecies thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils, often in open, sunny habitats such as heaths and moors. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific environmental conditions, making it sensitive to habitat disturbance. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
