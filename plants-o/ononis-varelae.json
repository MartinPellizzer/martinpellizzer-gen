    "intro": "Ononis varelae, commonly known as the Chilean sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Chile. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy and coastal soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Ononis varelae plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
