    "intro": "Ononis natrix var. adglutinans, commonly known as the sticky everlasting or sticky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces a sticky resin that coats its stems and leaves, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it an important component of xerophilous ecosystems."
