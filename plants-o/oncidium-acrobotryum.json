    "intro": "Oncidium acrobotryum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its showy, often yellow or orange-colored flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, warm environments. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Oncidium acrobotryum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
