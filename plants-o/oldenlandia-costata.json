    "intro": "Oldenlandia costata, commonly known as the bead vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, bead-like flowers that are often white or pale blue in color. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, colorful aril. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Oldenlandia costata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to cascade from hanging baskets or trellises."
