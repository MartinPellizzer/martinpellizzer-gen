    "intro": "Oenothera novae-scotiae var. distantifolia, commonly known as the distant-leaved evening primrose, is a perennial herb native to eastern Canada. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite, linear leaves that are spaced apart, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its capsules bear numerous small, oblong seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is often found in sandy or disturbed soils in open habitats."
