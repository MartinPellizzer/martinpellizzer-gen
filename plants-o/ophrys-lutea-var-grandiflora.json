    "intro": "Ophrys lutea var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking yellow and brown floral structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that aids in pollination by male bees. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heaths. Its flowers are relatively large and showy, with a complex morphology that includes a labellum designed to attract and manipulate pollinators. This orchid is a member of the Ophrys genus, known for its mimicry and specialized pollination strategies."
