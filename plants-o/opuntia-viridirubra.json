    "intro": "Opuntia viridirubra, commonly known as the green-red prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems known as cladodes, which are typically green with red or purple hues. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Opuntia viridirubra is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system and a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
