    "intro": "Olfersia decurrens, commonly known as the creeping waxplant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Olfersia decurrens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and blooms."
