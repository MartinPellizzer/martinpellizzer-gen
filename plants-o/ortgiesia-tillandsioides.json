    "intro": "Ortgiesia tillandsioides, commonly known as the silver star bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, a feature typical of many bromeliads. The plant's foliage is covered in dense, silvery-white trichomes, which reflect light and help reduce water loss. It produces striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom in a cluster at the center of the rosette. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is popular in horticulture but requires specific care to thrive."
