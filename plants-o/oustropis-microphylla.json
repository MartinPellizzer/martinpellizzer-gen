    "intro": "Oustropis microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaf oustropis, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant features finely divided, feathery leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbrella-like clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
