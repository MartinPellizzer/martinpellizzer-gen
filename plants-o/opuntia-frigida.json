    "intro": "Opuntia frigida, commonly known as the snow-flake cactus, is a species of cactus native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure and features small, rounded pads covered in dense white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, red fruits. Opuntia frigida is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate frost, making it a hardy species for alpine and arctic environments. Its botanical structure reflects its ability to conserve water and survive in harsh, dry conditions."
