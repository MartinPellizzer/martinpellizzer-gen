    "intro": "Orthantha lanceolata var. olotensis, commonly known as the Olotense Orthantha, is a perennial herb native to specific regions in southern Africa. It is characterized by its lanceolate, often hairy leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle aesthetic to its foliage. Its growth habit is low to the ground, with a compact form that makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. The species is noted for its adaptability to well-drained soils and its preference for full sun to partial shade."
