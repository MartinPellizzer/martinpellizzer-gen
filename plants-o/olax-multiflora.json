    "intro": "Olax multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered olax, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Olax multiflora is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
