    "intro": "Onobrychis tommasinii var. ocellata, commonly known as the spotted vetch, is a leguminous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with distinctive white or yellow spots, and its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to violet. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
