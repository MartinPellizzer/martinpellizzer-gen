    "intro": "Orchis morio subsp. longicornu, commonly known as the long-horned orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with a distinctive yellow-green lip, which plays a crucial role in attracting its specific pollinators. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and requires a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its life cycle is long, with some individuals taking several years to reach maturity and bloom. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered endangered in many regions."
