    "intro": "Oberonia wallie-silvae, commonly known as the Wallis Island orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the island of Wallis in the South Pacific. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, intricate flower structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from greenish-white to pale yellow. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
