    "intro": "Oncidium welteri, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and orange flowers that resemble butterflies, hence its common name. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and produces pendulous inflorescences with numerous small, fragrant blossoms. Oncidium welteri thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
