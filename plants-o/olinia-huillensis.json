    "intro": "Olinia huillensis, commonly known as the Huill\u00e9n cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in northern Chile. It is a spineless cactus that typically grows in rocky soils and coastal areas. The plant has a cylindrical stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height, and it produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Olinia huillensis is adapted to survive in extreme conditions, making it a resilient and unique botanical specimen."
