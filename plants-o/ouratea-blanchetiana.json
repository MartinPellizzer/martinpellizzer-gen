    "intro": "Ouratea blanchetiana, commonly known as the white-flowered ouratea, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the wet season. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and delicate floral display. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland tropical forests."
