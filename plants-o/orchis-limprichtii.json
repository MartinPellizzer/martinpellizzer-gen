    "intro": "Orchis limprichtii, commonly known as the Limpricht's orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodlands or rocky habitats. Its morphology includes a tall, erect stem with a few broad, lance-shaped leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Orchis limprichtii is considered a species of conservation concern."
