    "intro": "Oxyacantha obtusata, commonly known as the blunt-leaved hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves with a blunt or rounded tip. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in autumn. Its bark is typically gray to brown, becoming fissured with age, and it often grows in woodland edges or along stream banks. Oxyacantha obtusata is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
