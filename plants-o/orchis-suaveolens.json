    "intro": "Orchis suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodlands and meadows. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive sweet fragrance, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots contain alkaloids and have been used historically in traditional medicine. The orchid's life cycle includes a dormant period, with a short flowering season in late spring to early summer."
