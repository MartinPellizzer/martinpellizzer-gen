    "intro": "Orobanche teucriophya, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces small, pale yellow or white flowers and has a short, unbranched stem. It typically parasitizes plants in the legume family, such as vetches and clovers. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
