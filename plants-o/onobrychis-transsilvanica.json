    "intro": "Onobrychis transsilvanica, commonly known as Transylvanian burclover, is a perennial legume native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces pods containing small, rounded seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
