    "intro": "Oreogrammitis ceratocarpa, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, lance-shaped fronds with a distinct, serrated margin. The plant's spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its leaves, a feature typical of many ferns. It is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its epiphytic lifestyle, with specialized roots for absorbing moisture from the air."
