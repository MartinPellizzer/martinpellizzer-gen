    "intro": "Onobrychis, commonly known as false vetch, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species, many of which are shrubs or small trees native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plants are characterized by their trifoliate leaves and pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. Onobrychis species are often found in dry, rocky soils and are adapted to semi-arid environments. They are also valued for their nitrogen-fixing ability, which makes them useful in soil restoration and as forage plants."
