    "intro": "Orobanche sinensis var. sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to regions of East Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It is often found growing on the roots of various herbaceous plants, such as legumes and grasses. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops if left uncontrolled."
