    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza harrisiana var. condorensis, commonly known as the Condor Island harrisia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in lowland forests or along stream banks. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
