    "intro": "Oncodostigma, commonly known as the \"spiny bladder,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive spiny or hairy structures on the fruiting bodies, which aid in seed dispersal. The plants typically have narrow, linear leaves and produce small, often inconspicuous flowers. Oncodostigma species are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. Their botanical features make them well-adapted to harsh conditions, contributing to their ecological significance in such habitats."
