    "intro": "Oreogrammitis hispida, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping rhizome with dense, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. The plant's unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and rock gardens."
