    "intro": "Obelisteca, commonly known as the \"false ivy,\" is a climbing plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and showy, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, making it toxic to humans and animals. Obelisteca thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a valuable ornamental plant and a potential weed in cultivated areas."
