    "intro": "Opuntia basilaris var. humistrata, commonly known as the lowland prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-like stems covered in clusters of spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soil conditions through its extensive root system. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well-suited for desert climates."
