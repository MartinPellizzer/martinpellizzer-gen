    "intro": "Othonna opima, commonly known as the mountain snowbush, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, compact growth with fleshy, grey-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. Othonna opima is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
