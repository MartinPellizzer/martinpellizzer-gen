    "intro": "Orogenia fusiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mountain lichen, is a unique species found in high-altitude regions. It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria, forming a composite structure known as a lichen. The plant exhibits a thallus that is typically flattened and leaf-like, with a distinct, elongated shape. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found on rock surfaces or tree bark. Due to its specialized habitat, it plays an important role in nutrient cycling in alpine ecosystems."
