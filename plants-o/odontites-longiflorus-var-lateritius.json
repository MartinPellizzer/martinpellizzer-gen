    "intro": "Odontites longiflorus var. lateritius, commonly known as the laterite odontite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or lateritic habitats. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
