    "intro": "Orchis coriophora f. virescens, commonly known as the green-flowered narrow-leaf orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or heathland habitats. It is a perennial herb that produces a single, erect flowering stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
