    "intro": "Ossaea sulbahiensis, commonly known as the Kashmiri snow lotus, is a rare alpine plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ossaea sulbahiensis is considered a vulnerable species."
