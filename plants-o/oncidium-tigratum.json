    "intro": "Oncidium tigratum, commonly known as the tiger orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting inflorescences that display a mix of white, yellow, and green hues, often resembling a tiger's stripes. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. It is a pseudobulbous orchid, meaning it has thickened stems that store water and nutrients. Oncidium tigratum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers."
