    "intro": "Ophrys subfusca, commonly known as the pale bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its flowers are usually pale brown to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Ophrys subfusca is a perennial herb that produces a single, upright stem bearing several flowers."
