    "intro": "Oxys pliniana, commonly known as the Plinian oxys, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped inflorescences. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at high altitudes. Its flowers are typically white or pale purple, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oxys pliniana is considered a vulnerable species."
