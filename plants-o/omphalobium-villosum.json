    "intro": "Omphalobium villosum, commonly known as the woolly sown vetch, is a perennial legume native to Australia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Omphalobium villosum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil rehabilitation and forage production."
