    "intro": "Osmoxylon orientale, commonly known as the Persian sandthorn, is a shrub native to arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. Osmoxylon orientale is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and astringent properties."
