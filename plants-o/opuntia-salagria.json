    "intro": "Opuntia salagria, commonly known as the narrowleaf prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, spineless stems that are often ribbed and covered in a layer of white wax. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia salagria is adapted to arid environments and has a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in sandy soils. Its structure and growth habits make it a notable species in desert ecosystems."
