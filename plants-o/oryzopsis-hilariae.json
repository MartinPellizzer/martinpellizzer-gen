    "intro": "Oryzopsis hilariae, commonly known as the desert grass or the Sierra foothill grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along canyon walls. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny grains of rice-like seeds. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions and has a deep root system for water absorption. Oryzopsis hilariae plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
