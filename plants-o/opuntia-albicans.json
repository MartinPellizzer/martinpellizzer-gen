    "intro": "Opuntia albicans, commonly known as the white prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in sharp spines and small glochids. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are modified into photosynthetic stems, and it has a deep root system that allows it to survive in arid environments. Opuntia albicans is also known for its ability to store water, making it highly adapted to desert conditions."
