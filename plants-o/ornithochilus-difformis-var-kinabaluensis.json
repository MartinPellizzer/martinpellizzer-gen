    "intro": "Ornithochilus difformis var. kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the high-altitude regions of Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows on rock surfaces or in shaded forest areas, adapting to the cool and humid conditions of its native habitat. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, with intricate petal structures that attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
