    "intro": "Orobus maritimus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found growing on dunes or rocky shores. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss and protect against salt spray. Orobus maritimus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
