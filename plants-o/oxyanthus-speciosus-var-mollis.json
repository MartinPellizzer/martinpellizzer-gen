    "intro": "Oxyanthus speciosus var. mollis, commonly known as the soft-flowered oxyanthus, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and prefers well-drained, moist soil in partial shade. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate foliage and prolonged flowering period, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. However, it is relatively rare in cultivation and requires specific care to thrive."
