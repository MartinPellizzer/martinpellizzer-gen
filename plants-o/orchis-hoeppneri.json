    "intro": "Orchis hoeppneri, commonly known as the Hoepner's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a single, showy, violet-blue flower with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
