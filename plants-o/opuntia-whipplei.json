    "intro": "Opuntia whipplei, commonly known as the Whipple's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy pads, or cladodes, which are covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits known as tunas. Opuntia whipplei is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, succulent stems. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
