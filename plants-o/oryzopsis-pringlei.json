    "intro": "Oryzopsis pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed spikelets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments, making it a resilient member of desert ecosystems. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Oryzopsis pringlei plays a minor but ecologically significant role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
