    "intro": "Orbeopsis albocastanea, commonly known as the white-barked orbeopsis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
