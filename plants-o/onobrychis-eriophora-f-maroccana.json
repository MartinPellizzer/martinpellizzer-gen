    "intro": "Onobrychis eriophora f. maroccana, commonly known as the Moroccan velvet vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to North Africa. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid climates. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and prevent soil erosion. Its ornamental value also makes it a popular choice for landscaping in Mediterranean regions."
