It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. The plant features slender stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow, linear, and slightly hairy. It produces small, pale blue or white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late summer. This variety is notable for its resilience and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine zones."
