    "intro": "Orchis latifolia var. cruenta, commonly known as the broad-leaved orchid or the red-veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically range in color from pink to purple. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with prominent veins, and its flowers are arranged in a loose spike. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. This orchid is an important part of the local flora and is protected in many regions due to habitat loss."
