    "intro": "Odontosoria scoparia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a fern-like vascular plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, linear to lanceolate leaves that are often arranged in whorls. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the leaves, a feature typical of many ferns. Odontosoria scoparia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
