    "intro": "Opuntia alcahes, commonly known as the coastal prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its flattened, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in sharp spines and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces edible fruits known as tunas, which are typically yellow or red in color. Opuntia alcahes is adapted to arid and coastal environments, with succulent stems that store water and reduce transpiration. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
