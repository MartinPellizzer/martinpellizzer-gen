    "intro": "Oberonia costeriana, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a faint fragrance. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is typically found in lowland forests. Due to its delicate nature, it requires careful cultivation to ensure its survival in both natural and horticultural settings."
