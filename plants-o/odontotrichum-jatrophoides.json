It features small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of blue to violet flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting floral display."
