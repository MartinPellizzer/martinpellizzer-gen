It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or arid environments. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats."
