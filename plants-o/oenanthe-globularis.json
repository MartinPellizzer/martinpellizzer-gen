    "intro": "Oenanthe globularis, commonly known as the globular water dropwort, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive globular inflorescence, which consists of tightly clustered, small white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist or wet environments, such as marshes and stream sides, and is often found in shallow water. Its leaves are broad and arrow-shaped, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by water. Oenanthe globularis is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables."
