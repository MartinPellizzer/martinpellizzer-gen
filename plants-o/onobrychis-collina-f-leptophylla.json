    "intro": "Onobrychis collina f. leptophylla, commonly known as the slender-leaf bursfoot, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers that appear in spikes. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its seeds are encased in bur-like structures, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
