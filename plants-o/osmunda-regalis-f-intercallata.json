    "intro": "Osmunda regalis f. intercallata, commonly known as the intermediate royal fern, is a variant of the royal fern characterized by its unique frond morphology. This fern exhibits a mix of sterile and fertile fronds, with the fertile ones bearing sporangia on the underside. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in wetlands and along stream banks. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its elongated, pinnately divided fronds. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for wetland ecosystems and its use in ecological restoration projects."
