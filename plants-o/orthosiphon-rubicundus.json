It is characterized by its slender, reddish stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers in clusters, which are typically arranged in spikes. Orthosiphon rubicundus is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
