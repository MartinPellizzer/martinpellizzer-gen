    "intro": "Othocallis siberica subsp. otschiauriae, commonly known as the Siberian marsh lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It typically grows in wet, marshy areas and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to tolerate frost and has a preference for nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils. This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
