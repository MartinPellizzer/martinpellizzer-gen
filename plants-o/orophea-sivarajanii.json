    "intro": "Orophea sivarajanii, commonly known as the Sivarajan's star tree, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Cornaceae and is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves and showy, yellow-orange inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often at elevations between 600 and 1,500 meters. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant produces small, winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
