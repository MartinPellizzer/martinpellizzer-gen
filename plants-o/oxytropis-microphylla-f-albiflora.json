    "intro": "Oxytropis microphylla f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, compound leaves and showy, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep taproots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife, though it is not typically cultivated for agricultural purposes. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some xeriscaped gardens."
