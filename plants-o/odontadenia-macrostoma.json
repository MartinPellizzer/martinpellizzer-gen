    "intro": "Odontadenia macrostoma, commonly known as the broad-leaved rock fig, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by edible, fleshy fruits. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
