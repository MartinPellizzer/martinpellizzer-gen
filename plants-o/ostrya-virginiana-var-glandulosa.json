    "intro": "Ostrya virginiana var. glandulosa, commonly known as the American hazelnut, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and serrated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by edible, nut-like fruits that mature in the fall. Its bark is typically smooth and gray, with some roughness on older stems. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental and ecological attributes."
