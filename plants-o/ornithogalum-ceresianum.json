    "intro": "Ornithogalum ceresianum, commonly known as the mountain star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking umbels of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is characterized by its underground bulb, which serves as a storage organ for nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
