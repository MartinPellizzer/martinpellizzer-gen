It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Oxydectes oxyphylla is often found in disturbed habitats and can become invasive in certain areas."
