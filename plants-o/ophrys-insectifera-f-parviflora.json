    "intro": "Ophrys insectifera f. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Its flowers are small and delicate, with a pale yellowish-green coloration and intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
