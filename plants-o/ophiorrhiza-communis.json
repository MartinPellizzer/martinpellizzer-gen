    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza communis, commonly known as the common sea bean, is a tropical shrub belonging to the family Rhizophoraceae. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in panicles. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in coastal and mangrove environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Its fruits are capsules that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by water and wind. Ophiorrhiza communis is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
