    "intro": "Orchis mascula var. speciosa, commonly known as the showy orchis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple with a distinctive yellow lip, which serves to attract pollinators. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, and it thrives in moist, calcareous soils. The showy orchis is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and other open habitats."
