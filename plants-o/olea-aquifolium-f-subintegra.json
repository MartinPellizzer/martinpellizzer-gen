    "intro": "Olea aquifolium f. subintegra, commonly known as the smooth-leaved olive, is a unique variant of the olive tree characterized by its finely serrated leaves that are less lobed than the typical species. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, blackish berries that are used in traditional medicine. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for ornamental gardening and small spaces. The leaves are often used in herbal remedies due to their high content of oleuropein and other bioactive compounds."
