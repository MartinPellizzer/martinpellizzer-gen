    "intro": "Oxalis compacta, commonly known as the clustered wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that features small, heart-shaped leaves with distinctive yellow-orange markings. The plant produces clusters of delicate, five-petaled flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread and form dense mats of foliage."
