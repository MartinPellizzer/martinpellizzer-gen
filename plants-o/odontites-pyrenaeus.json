    "intro": "Odontites pyrenaeus, commonly known as the Pyrenean toothbrush, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, basal leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils at high altitudes. It is a perennial herb that thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
