    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 personei subsp. bourlieri, commonly known as the Bourlier's bee orchid, is a rare hybrid orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the genus Ophrys, which is known for its mimicry of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant produces strikingly detailed floral structures that resemble female bees, a trait evolved to enhance pollination through sexual deception. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
