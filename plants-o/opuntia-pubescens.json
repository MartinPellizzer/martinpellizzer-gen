    "intro": "Opuntia pubescens, commonly known as the woolly prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems covered in dense, white, woolly hair. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Opuntia pubescens is also known for its ability to store water in its thick stems, making it highly resilient to drought."
