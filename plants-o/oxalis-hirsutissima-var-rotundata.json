    "intro": "Oxalis hirsutissima var. rotundata, commonly known as the woolly wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves with a distinctive woolly texture due to its dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers with five petals, often appearing in spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shady garden landscapes."
