    "intro": "Oldenlandia muscosa, commonly known as the silverleaf spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, white or pale blue flowers and its trailing growth habit. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed."
