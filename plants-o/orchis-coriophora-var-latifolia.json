    "intro": "Orchis coriophora var. latifolia, commonly known as the Broad-leaved Heath Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in spikes. This variety is typically found in open, sunny environments such as heathlands and grassy slopes. Its growth is closely tied to nutrient-poor soils, which influences its distribution and ecological niche. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
