    "intro": "Oxalis reptatrix, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with distinctive veins and small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, forming dense mats that suppress weeds. Oxalis reptatrix is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
