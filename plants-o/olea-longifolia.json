    "intro": "Olea longifolia, commonly known as the Italian olive tree, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by oval-shaped drupes, or olives, which are the fruit of the tree. Olea longifolia is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often cultivated for its oil-rich fruits. Its botanical features make it an important plant in both horticulture and the production of olive oil."
