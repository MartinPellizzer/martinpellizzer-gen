    "intro": "Oxytropis deflexa var. sericea, commonly known as silverleaf locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to avoid consuming any part of this plant."
