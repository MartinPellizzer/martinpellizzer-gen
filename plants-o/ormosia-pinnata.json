    "intro": "Ormosia pinnata, commonly known as the broadleaf senna, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged with numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Ormosia pinnata is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its hard, durable wood. It also has traditional uses in local medicine and as a source of tannins."
