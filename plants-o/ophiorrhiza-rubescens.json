    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza rubescens, commonly known as the red-flowered Ophiorrhiza, is a tropical shrub belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red, often with a distinctive red calyx. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and is found in Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. Its leaves are simple and opposite, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Ophiorrhiza rubescens is also notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it an important component of tropical rainforest ecosystems."
