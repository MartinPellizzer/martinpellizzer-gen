    "intro": "Olea craniomorpha, commonly known as the skull-shaped olive, is a unique species within the Oleaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, helmet-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant is native to a specific region in southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its small, fragrant flowers are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, edible fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Olea craniomorpha is considered a rare and endangered species."
