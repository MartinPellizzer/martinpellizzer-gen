    "intro": "Oncidium emarginatum, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a distinctive yellow and green coloration. The plant has strap-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine, velvety texture. Oncidium emarginatum is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded environments. It requires bright, indirect light and well-draining potting media to thrive."
