    "intro": "Onoctonia calcarata, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored upper portion, which is actually a grafted variety of the Hylocereus species. The lower part of the plant is a rootstock from the genus Onoclea, which provides the necessary structure and nutrients. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom at night, contributing to its common name. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ease of care."
