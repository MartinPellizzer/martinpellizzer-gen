    "intro": "Oberonia pleistophylla, commonly known as the pleistophylla orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, epiphytic growth habit, often found clinging to tree bark in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and green, which are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Oberonia pleistophylla is considered a conservation concern."
