    "intro": "Oreomecon alpina subsp. alpina, commonly known as the alpine oreomecon, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Papaveraceae family, which includes poppies and other similar species. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows and slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
