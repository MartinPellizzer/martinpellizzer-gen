It is characterized by its showy, often pink or white flowers that bloom in the early morning, hence its common name. The plants typically have alternate, ovate leaves and produce small, capsule-like fruits. Ostryopsis species are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in temperate and subtropical areas. They are often found in moist, well-drained soils and are valued for their ornamental appeal."
