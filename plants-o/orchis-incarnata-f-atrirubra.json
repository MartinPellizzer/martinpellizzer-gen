    "intro": "Orchis incarnata f. atrirubra, commonly known as the red-veined orchid, is a striking variant of the showy lady's tresses orchid. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist woodlands and wet meadows in eastern North America. The plant features a tall, erect stem with dense, spirally arranged leaves and a long, branched inflorescence of violet-blue flowers. Its flowers are characterized by deep red veins, which distinguish it from the typical form. This orchid is pollinated primarily by bees and is an indicator species for rich, undisturbed habitats."
