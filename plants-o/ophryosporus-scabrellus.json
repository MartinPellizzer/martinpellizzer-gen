It is characterized by its leathery, wrinkled thallus with a dark, almost black upper surface and a lighter, sometimes whitish lower surface. The lichen typically grows on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate and subtropical regions. It is known for its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions, including drought and pollution. Its chemical composition includes various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization."
