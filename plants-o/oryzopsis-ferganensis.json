    "intro": "Oryzopsis ferganensis, commonly known as the Fergana grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It typically grows in dry, grassland environments and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its robust root system, which helps it survive in poor soil conditions. Oryzopsis ferganensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
