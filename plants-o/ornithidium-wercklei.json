    "intro": "Ornithidium wercklei, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble the wings of birds, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity and well-drained soil to flourish. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the undersides of its leaves. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Ornithidium wercklei is often found in protected areas and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
