    "intro": "Onopordum ilex, commonly known as the evergreen thistle, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silver-gray, woolly foliage and purple-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a robust root system and can thrive in poor, rocky soils. It is drought-tolerant and often found in coastal and dry habitats. Its leaves are covered in stiff hairs, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores."
