    "intro": "Orobanche virginica, commonly known as the common yellow witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its yellow, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as fields and roadsides, where it can attach to various host species like legumes and grasses. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by its host, after which it forms a haustorium to penetrate the host's roots. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly reduce the growth and yield of its host plants."
