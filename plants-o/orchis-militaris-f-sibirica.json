    "intro": "Orchis militaris f. sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian soldier's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often pale pink or greenish flowers with a distinctive hooded structure. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and thrives in alpine or subarctic environments. Its morphology includes a short, stocky rhizome and a single, erect stem bearing a few showy flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
