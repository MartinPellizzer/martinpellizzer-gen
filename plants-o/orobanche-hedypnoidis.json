    "intro": "Orobanche hedypnoidis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of various species in the Brassicaceae family. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, and its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of its host. It is found in arid and semi-arid regions, often in disturbed soils. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on agricultural crops."
