    "intro": "Ophrys aranifera f. valdecornuta, commonly known as the Valdecornuta Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flowers with intricate patterns that resemble insect bodies. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
