    "intro": "Ornithogalum arabicum var. macrocomum, commonly known as the large-seeded star-of-Babylon, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features striking, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. Its bulbs are toxic and contain calcium oxalate crystals, making it potentially harmful if ingested. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
