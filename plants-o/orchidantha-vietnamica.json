    "intro": "Orchidantha vietnamica, commonly known as the Vietnamese orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to Vietnam. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered threatened in its natural range."
