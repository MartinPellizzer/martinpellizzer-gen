    "intro": "Ononis spinosa var. eversii, commonly known as the Ever's sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variant is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form of Ononis spinosa."
