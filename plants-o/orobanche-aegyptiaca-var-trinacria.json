    "intro": "Orobanche aegyptiaca var. trinacria, commonly known as the Mediterranean dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. It is a hemiparasite, meaning it can photosynthesize to a limited extent but primarily depends on its host for water and minerals. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants, particularly in agricultural settings."
