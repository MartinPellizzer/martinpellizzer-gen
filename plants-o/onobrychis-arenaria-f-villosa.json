    "intro": "Onobrychis arenaria f. villosa, commonly known as the hairy field vetch, is a perennial legume native to dry, sandy soils in Mediterranean regions. It features slender, creeping stems covered with soft, hairy foliage, and its small, pea-like flowers are typically pale yellow or greenish in color. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain small, round seeds. It is well adapted to arid conditions and is often used for erosion control and as a forage crop. Its nitrogen-fixing ability makes it valuable in improving soil fertility."
