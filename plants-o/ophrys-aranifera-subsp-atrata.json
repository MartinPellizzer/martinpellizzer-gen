    "intro": "Ophrys aranifera subsp. atrata, commonly known as the black bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found primarily in the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, strikingly colored flower with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland edges and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
