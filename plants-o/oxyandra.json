    "intro": "Oxyandra, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that range from white to pale yellow. The plant produces hard, woody fruits that contain small seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. Oxyandra is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems and a slow growth rate. It is often used in landscaping for its resilience and ability to thrive in harsh environments."
