    "intro": "Oleandra distenta, commonly known as the spreading oleander, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are typically lance-shaped and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, blooming throughout the growing season. Oleandra distenta is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a resilient plant in arid environments. However, it is important to note that all parts of this plant are toxic and should be handled with care."
