    "intro": "Oxalis vulgaris, commonly known as wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is often found in woodland areas and along roadsides, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Oxalis vulgaris is a perennial herb that produces small, edible fruits, though its leaves and flowers are also edible in moderation. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for various purposes."
