    "intro": "Ophiuros corymbosus, commonly known as the clustered sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense clusters of blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, silver-gray foliage that is adapted to withstand salty sea air and coastal winds. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize sandy or gravelly soils along the shore. Ophiuros corymbosus plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
