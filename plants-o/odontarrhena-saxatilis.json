    "intro": "Odontarrhena saxatilis, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Odontarrhena saxatilis is adapted to withstand drought and is often found in rocky outcrops and coastal areas."
