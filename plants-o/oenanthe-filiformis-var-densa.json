    "intro": "Oenanthe filiformis var. densa, commonly known as the dense filiform water dropwort, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves and small, white to greenish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, preferring moist soils along stream banks or in damp woodlands. Its stems are often densely packed, giving it a bushy appearance, and it is known for its rapid growth in suitable conditions. The species is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
