    "intro": "Orchis collina subsp. fedtschenkoi, commonly known as the Alpine orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high altitudes. Its flowers are often arranged in a raceme and are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. This subspecies is notable for its ecological importance in its native ecosystems and is often protected due to habitat loss and over-collection."
