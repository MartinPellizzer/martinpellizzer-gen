    "intro": "Onobrychis lunata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are narrow and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, elliptical seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in forage and erosion control. Onobrychis lunata is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
