    "intro": "Orthopogon parvifolius, commonly known as the small-leaved grass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Orthopogon parvifolius is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
