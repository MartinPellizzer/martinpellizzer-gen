It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its narrow, upright stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its branches. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Oligomeris lycopodioides plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
