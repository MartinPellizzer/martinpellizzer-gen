    "intro": "Odina wodier var. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh-elder, is a variant of the marsh-elder plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters and are adapted for wind pollination. This variety is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
