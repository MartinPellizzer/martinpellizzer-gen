    "intro": "Ononis ludovicii, commonly known as the Ludovician sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically linear to lance-shaped, adapted to thrive in rocky or sandy soils. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as cliffs, gravelly slopes, and disturbed areas. Ononis ludovicii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
