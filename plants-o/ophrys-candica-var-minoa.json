    "intro": "Ophrys candica var. minoa, commonly known as the Minotaur orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, featuring a pseudobulb and a single, showy flower that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male pollinators. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and requires a cool, moist climate with high humidity. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, and the species is noted for its limited distribution and conservation status. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Ophrys candica var. minoa is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
