    "intro": "Ophrys oestrifera subsp. abchasica, commonly known as the Abkhazian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a strikingly bee-like flower that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, thriving in mountainous and semi-arid environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its mimicry. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
