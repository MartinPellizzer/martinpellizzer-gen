    "intro": "Orchis japonica, commonly known as Japanese twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique morphology, including two opposite leaves and a single, showy flower. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and meadows. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a distinctive hood-like structure, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Orchis japonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitats."
