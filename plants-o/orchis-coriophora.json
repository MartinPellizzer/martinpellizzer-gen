    "intro": "Orchis coriophora, commonly known as the common twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems that bear two opposite leaves near the base. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in a spike, which are often hidden among the foliage. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is typically found in meadows and woodland edges. Orchis coriophora is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it can derive some nutrients from its host through specialized roots."
