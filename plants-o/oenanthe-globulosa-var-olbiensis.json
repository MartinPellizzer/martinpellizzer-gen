    "intro": "Oenanthe globulosa var. olbiensis, commonly known as the Olbiense Waterdropwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions of Europe. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant features slender, branching stems with small, rounded leaves that are often submerged. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and it produces distinctive, spherical fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
