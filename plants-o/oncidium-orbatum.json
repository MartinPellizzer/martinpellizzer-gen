    "intro": "Oncidium orbatum, commonly known as the Orchid of the Moon, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a distinctive yellow and green coloration. The plant has strap-like leaves that are long and narrow, adapted for efficient photosynthesis in its natural habitat. Oncidium orbatum is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. It requires bright, indirect light and consistent humidity to thrive, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
