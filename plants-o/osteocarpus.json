    "intro": "Osteocarpus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of blue or purple. The plant is native to coastal regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Osteocarpus species are often found growing in maritime climates, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Their unique morphology makes them popular in coastal gardens and as ornamental plants."
