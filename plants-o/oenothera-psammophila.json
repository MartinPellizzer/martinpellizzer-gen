    "intro": "Oenothera psammophila, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and sandy environments in the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, showy yellow or orange flowers. The plant has adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils, often found in desert and coastal dune habitats. Its flowers typically bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Oenothera psammophila is also known for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range."
