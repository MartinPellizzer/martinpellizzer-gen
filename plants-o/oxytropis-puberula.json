It is a legume, belonging to the Fabaceae family, and is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow to reddish-purple pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gravelly slopes. Oxytropis puberula plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
