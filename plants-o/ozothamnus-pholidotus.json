    "intro": "Ozothamnus pholidotus, commonly known as the silverleaf daisy, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It features silver-gray foliage that provides a striking contrast to its bright yellow flowers. The plant has a compact growth habit with multiple stems and is drought-tolerant once established. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
