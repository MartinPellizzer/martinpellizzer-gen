    "intro": "Oreorchis sanguinea, commonly known as the red helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and showy, reddish-brown flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in acidic soils. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. Oreorchis sanguinea is often considered a rare and protected species due to habitat loss and over-collection."
