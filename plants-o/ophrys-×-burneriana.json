    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 burneriana, commonly known as the Burner's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral morphology, which features a specialized lip that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in temperate regions of Europe. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange with dark markings, and it blooms in early spring. Ophrys \u00d7 burneriana is a rare and protected species, often found in specific habitats such as limestone grasslands and woodland edges."
