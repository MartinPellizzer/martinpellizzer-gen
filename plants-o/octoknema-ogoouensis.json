    "intro": "Octoknema ogoouensis, commonly known as the African ironwood tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to western and central Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by small, fleshy fruits. Octoknema ogoouensis is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various wildlife species."
