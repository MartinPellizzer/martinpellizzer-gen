    "intro": "Onobrychis kotschyana f. majoriflora, commonly known as the large-flowered sweet clover, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and erect, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and for soil improvement."
