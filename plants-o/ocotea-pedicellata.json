    "intro": "Ocotea pedicellata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Mexico, Guatemala, and Costa Rica. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, evergreen leaves and small, white flowers that appear in clusters. Its wood is highly valued for its rich reddish color and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in traditional craftsmanship. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered and protected in many areas."
