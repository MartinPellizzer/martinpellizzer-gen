    "intro": "Othonna minima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved othonna, is a small, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features narrow, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is typically found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, thriving in full sun. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
