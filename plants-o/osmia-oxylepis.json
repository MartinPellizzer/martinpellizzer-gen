    "intro": "Osmia oxylepis, commonly known as the oxylepis mason bee, is a species of solitary bee native to various regions in Europe and parts of Asia. This bee is characterized by its robust body and distinctive metallic blue or green coloration, which serves as a form of aposematic coloration to deter predators. Osmia oxylepis is a pollinator that plays an important role in the ecological balance of its habitat, particularly in the pollination of flowering plants. It constructs its nests in pre-existing cavities, such as hollow stems or abandoned beetle burrows, where it lays its eggs and provisions them with pollen. The plant-related aspects of Osmia oxylepis are closely tied to its foraging behavior, as it relies on a variety of flowering plants for nectar and pollen collection."
