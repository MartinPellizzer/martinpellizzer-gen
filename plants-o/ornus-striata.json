    "intro": "[WRONG START] Ornu striata, commonly known as the striated ornus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. Ornus striata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
