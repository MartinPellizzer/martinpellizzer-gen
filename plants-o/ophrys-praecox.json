    "intro": "Ophrys praecox, commonly known as the early bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive floral structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee. The plant typically grows to a height of about 20\u201340 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a single spike of flowers. Its flowers are specialized for pollination by male bees, which are attracted by the orchid's pheromone-like scent. Ophrys praecox thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges, and it blooms from late winter to early spring."
