    "intro": "Oporinia, commonly known as the white-flowered orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, white or pale pink flowers. The plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Oporinia species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic. Their roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain."
