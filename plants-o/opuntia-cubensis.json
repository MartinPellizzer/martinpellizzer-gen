    "intro": "Opuntia cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and are often ribbed. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which are followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia cubensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick stems. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
