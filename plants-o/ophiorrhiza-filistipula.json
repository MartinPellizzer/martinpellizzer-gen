    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza filistipula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mangrove, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments, often found in mangrove forests and tidal mudflats. The plant has small, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture, and its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. It produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by water, aiding in its propagation in coastal areas. This species plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
