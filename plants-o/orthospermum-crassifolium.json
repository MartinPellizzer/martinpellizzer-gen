    "intro": "Orthospermum crassifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf orthospermum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, which helps it conserve water in dry conditions. The showy yellow flowers appear in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
