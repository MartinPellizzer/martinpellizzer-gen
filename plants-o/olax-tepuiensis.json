    "intro": "Olax tepuiensis, commonly known as the tepui olax, is a unique plant species native to the tepuis of South America, particularly in the Guyanas and Venezuela. It is a shrub or small tree that thrives in the nutrient-poor soils of these isolated mountain ranges. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers. It plays a significant role in the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various species. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
