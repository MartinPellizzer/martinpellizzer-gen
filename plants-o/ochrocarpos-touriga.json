    "intro": "Ochrocarpos touriga, commonly known as the Touriga grapevine, is a viticultural variety native to the Douro region of Portugal. It is characterized by its medium to high vigor and its ability to thrive in the warm, dry climate of the region. The plant typically exhibits deep green leaves with a slightly hairy underside, and it produces clusters of small, dark blue to black grapes. Ochrocarpos touriga is valued for its robust structure and its role in blending with other varietals to create complex red wines. Its botanical features make it well-suited for the challenging conditions of the Douro Valley."
