    "intro": "Ormocarpum affinis, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts when mature. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it well adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions."
