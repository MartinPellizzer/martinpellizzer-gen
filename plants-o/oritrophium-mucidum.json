    "intro": "Oritrophium mucidum, commonly known as the stinking tobacco or stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are typically hairy and have a strong, unpleasant odor, which is a defense mechanism against herbivores. Oritrophium mucidum is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
