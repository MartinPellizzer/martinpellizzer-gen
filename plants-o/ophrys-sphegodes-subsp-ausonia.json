    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes subsp. ausonia, commonly known as the Ausonian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, with a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, aiding in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a delicate, greenish-yellow color with intricate patterns. Due to habitat loss and its restricted distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
