    "intro": "Opercularia hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy opercularia, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its dense, woolly texture and a distinctive yellowish to orange-brown coloration. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which provides it with nutrients through photosynthesis. It typically grows on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate and subtropical regions. Opercularia hirsuta is often found in shaded, humid environments and is known for its slow growth rate."
