    "intro": "Oreocnide nivea, commonly known as the snow orchid, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually hairy and oval-shaped, adapted to withstand harsh mountain climates. Oreocnide nivea plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small organisms."
