    "intro": "Oldenlandia tenelliflora, commonly known as the slenderleaf mistflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant typically grows as a herb or shrub, characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of tiny, white or yellowish flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, three-winged fruits that disperse its seeds."
