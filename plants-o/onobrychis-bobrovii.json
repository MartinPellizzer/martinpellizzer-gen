    "intro": "Onobrychis bobrovii, commonly known as Siberian vetch, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Onobrychis bobrovii is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration efforts."
