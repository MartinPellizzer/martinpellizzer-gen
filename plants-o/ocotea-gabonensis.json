    "intro": "Ocotea gabonensis, commonly known as African laurier or African camphorwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and West Africa. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored wood that emits a camphor-like scent. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface and produces small, fragrant flowers followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and mountain rainforests. Due to its valuable timber and medicinal properties, it is also of ecological and economic significance in its native range."
