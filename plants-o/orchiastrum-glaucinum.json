    "intro": "Orchiastrum glaucinum, commonly known as the blue glaucous orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers, which are highly specialized for pollination by specific species of bees. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests or alpine meadows. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Orchiastrum glaucinum is considered a vulnerable species."
