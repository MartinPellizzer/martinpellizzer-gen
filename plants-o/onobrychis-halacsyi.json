    "intro": "Onobrychis halacsyi, commonly known as the Hungarian clover, is a perennial legume native to the Carpathian Basin. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. It has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in poor soil conditions. Onobrychis halacsyi is also valued for its role in soil nitrogen fixation and as a forage crop for livestock."
