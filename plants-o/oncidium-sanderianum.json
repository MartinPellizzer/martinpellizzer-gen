    "intro": "Oncidium sanderianum, commonly known as the Sander's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting flowers that come in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture from the air. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Oncidium sanderianum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
