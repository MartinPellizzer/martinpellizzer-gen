    "intro": "Orobanche serpens, commonly known as the serpentine broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and stems, with a taproot that attaches to the roots of its host. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host plants."
