    "intro": "Ophrys parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered bee orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that resemble a bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodland floors and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers during the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophrys parviflora is considered a species of conservation concern."
