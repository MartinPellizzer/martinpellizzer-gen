    "intro": "Oligosporus campestris subsp. pacificus, commonly known as the Pacific marsh grass, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This subspecies thrives in wetland and marsh environments, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in early summer, and it is pollinated primarily by wind. The plant is also valued for its ability to tolerate saline conditions, making it an important species in coastal restoration projects."
