    "intro": "Osmunda regalis var. capensis, commonly known as the royal fern or the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with a distinctive dark brown, cinnamon-colored fiddlehead at the base. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fertile and sterile fronds arising from the same rhizome. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in groups. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
