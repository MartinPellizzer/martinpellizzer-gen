    "intro": "Odontochilus hatumetensis, commonly known as the Hatumetensis toothed orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, tooth-like structures on the leaf margins. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are small and pale green, often with a slight yellowish hue, and bloom during the wet season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
