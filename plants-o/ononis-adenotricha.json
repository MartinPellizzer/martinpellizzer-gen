    "intro": "Ononis adenotricha, commonly known as the hairy rock-cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often clustered in racemes. Its leaves are pinnately divided and covered in fine, hairy structures, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Ononis adenotricha is typically found on rocky soils and is well adapted to survive in drought conditions."
