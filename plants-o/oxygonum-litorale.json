    "intro": "Oxygonum litorale, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silvery, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune habitats. Its flowering period typically occurs in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Oxygonum litorale is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils against erosion."
