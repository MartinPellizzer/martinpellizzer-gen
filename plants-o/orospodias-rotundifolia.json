    "intro": "Orospodias rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rounded, leathery leaves and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its growth is slow, and it requires careful cultivation due to its sensitivity to environmental changes. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many areas."
