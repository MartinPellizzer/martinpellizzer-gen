It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheats. The plant is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences and small, greenish-white flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
