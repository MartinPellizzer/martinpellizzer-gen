    "intro": "Ocimum foetidum, commonly known as stinking basil, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and southern Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic leaves that emit a strong, pungent odor, which can be both appealing and off-putting. The plant belongs to the Lamiaceae family, sharing botanical traits with other herbs like mint and basil. Its small, tubular flowers are typically purple or white, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. Ocimum foetidum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
