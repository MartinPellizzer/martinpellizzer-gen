    "intro": "Opuntia humifusa var. parva, commonly known as the small prickly pear, is a low-growing cactus native to the southeastern United States. It features flattened, fleshy stems that are often covered in spines and glochids, which are small, hair-like spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, red to purple fruits. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. It is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
