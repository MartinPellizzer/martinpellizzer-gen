    "intro": "Orobanche biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, typically in clusters, and has a highly reduced structure with no true leaves. It is often found growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
