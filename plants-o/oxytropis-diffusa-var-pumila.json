    "intro": "Oxytropis diffusa var. pumila, commonly known as dwarf yellow vetch, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the western United States. It features small, pinnately compound leaves and produces yellow pea-like flowers, typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in restoration projects. Its small size and hardy nature make it well-suited for arid environments."
