    "intro": "Onobrychis aragatzi, commonly known as Armenian burr vetch, is a leguminous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, showing a preference for well-drained soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in natural habitats and is used in ecological restoration projects."
