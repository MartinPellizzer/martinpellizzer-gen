    "intro": "Ovieda brachypus, commonly known as the short-stemmed evergreen, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It possesses small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its woody stems are covered in a thick, waxy cuticle that helps protect it from intense sunlight and drought. Ovieda brachypus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
