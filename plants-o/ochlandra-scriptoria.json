    "intro": "Ochlandra scriptoria, commonly known as the scriptoria fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often used in horticultural displays. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Ochlandra scriptoria is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
