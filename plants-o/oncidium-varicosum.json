    "intro": "Oncidium varicosum, commonly known as the variable orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green to brownish flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs are elongated and slightly swollen, aiding in water storage. Oncidium varicosum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
