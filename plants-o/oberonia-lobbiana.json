    "intro": "Oberonia lobbiana, commonly known as the red-veined orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety green leaves with distinctive red veins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often arranged in a dense spike. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
