    "intro": "Ononis angustissima var. melillensis, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula and northern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
