    "intro": "Orchis sesquipedalis var. iberica, commonly known as the Iberian large-lobed orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and can be found in woodland edges and open grasslands. Its leaves are lanceolate and arranged along the stem, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil. This orchid is of interest to botanists due to its ecological significance and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
