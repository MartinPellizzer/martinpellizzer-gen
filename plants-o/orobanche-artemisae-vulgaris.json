    "intro": "Orobanche artemisae-vulgaris, commonly known as the common dwarf broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and is entirely dependent on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing members of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of its host, and it can significantly impact the growth of its host plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
