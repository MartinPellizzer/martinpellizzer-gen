    "intro": "Osmundopteris stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf royal fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. It belongs to the family Osmundaceae and is native to regions of eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. The plant features a creeping rhizome with upright, narrow leaves that are typically bright green and have a serrated margin. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Osmundopteris stricta thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
