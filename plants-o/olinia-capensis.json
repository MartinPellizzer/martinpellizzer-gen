    "intro": "Olinia capensis, commonly known as the Cape heath or mountain heath, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Olinia capensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
