    "intro": "Oporinia keretina, commonly known as the keretina fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Otogoniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal. Oporinia keretina plays a minor but important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
