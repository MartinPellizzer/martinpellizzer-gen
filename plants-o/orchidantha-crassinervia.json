    "intro": "Orchidantha crassinervia, commonly known as the broad-veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, strap-like leaves and striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique veining pattern on the leaves is a distinguishing feature, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
