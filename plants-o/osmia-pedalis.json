    "intro": "Osmia pedalis, commonly known as the slender mason bee, is a solitary bee species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a small to medium-sized bee, typically measuring between 8 to 12 millimeters in length, with a metallic blue or greenish body. The female Osmia pedalis constructs its nest in hollow stems, twigs, or pre-existing cavities, lining them with a mixture of plant resins and saliva. It primarily pollinates wildflowers and fruit trees, playing an important role in both wild and agricultural ecosystems. The species is known for its efficient pollination behavior and is often used in conservation and pollination enhancement programs."
