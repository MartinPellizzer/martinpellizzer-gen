    "intro": "Oreogrammitis clavata, commonly known as the clustered moss, is a small, evergreen moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and dark green, glossy leaves. The plant forms compact clusters, often on rocks or soil, and is frequently found in temperate regions. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a slightly curled appearance. Oreogrammitis clavata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms."
