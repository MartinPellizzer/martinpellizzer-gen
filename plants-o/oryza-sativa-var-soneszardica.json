It is characterized by its unique grain morphology and growth habits, which differ from standard rice varieties. This variety is native to specific regions in Asia and is adapted to particular climatic conditions. Botanically, it exhibits distinct genetic markers that set it apart from other Oryza sativa subspecies. Its study contributes to the understanding of rice biodiversity and potential agricultural applications."
