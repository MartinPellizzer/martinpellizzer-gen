    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 paschae, commonly known as the Paschal orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis purpurea. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland habitats across Europe. Its flowers are often pollinated by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinator populations. The species is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and hybrid origins."
