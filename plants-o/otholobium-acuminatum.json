    "intro": "Otholobium acuminatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bushveld clover, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial legume belonging to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and rocky soils, thriving in full sun. Its small, pod-like fruits contain several seeds that are dispersed by wind. Otholobium acuminatum plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in forage systems due to its nutritional value for livestock."
