    "intro": "Oberonia lunata, commonly known as the moon orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its unique, moon-shaped flower that is typically white or pale yellow with a greenish tinge. The plant grows in shaded, moist forest understories and has a slender, leafy stem that often produces multiple flowering spikes. Its flowers are highly fragrant and bloom during the rainy season, attracting various pollinators. Due to habitat loss, Oberonia lunata is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
