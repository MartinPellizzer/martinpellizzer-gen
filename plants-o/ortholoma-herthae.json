    "intro": "Ortholoma herthae, commonly known as Herth's ortholoma, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, and it is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
