    "intro": "Ornithogalum maritimum, commonly known as the sea lily or coastal star-of-Bethleem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It features a short, stout rhizome with lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers with six petals, which bloom in spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and wind exposure. Ornithogalum maritimum is often found growing in open habitats such as dunes and coastal grasslands."
