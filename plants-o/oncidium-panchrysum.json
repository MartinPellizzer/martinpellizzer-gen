    "intro": "Oncidium panchrysum, commonly known as the Lemon-Scented Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features vibrant, often yellow or orange flowers with a distinctive lemony fragrance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, warm environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in less fertile substrates. Oncidium panchrysum is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
