    "intro": "Opuntia phaeacantha var. spinosibacca, commonly known as the spiny-barked prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sunlight. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and for its fruit, which is rich in nutrients."
