    "intro": "Orithyia uniflora var. oxypetala, commonly known as the slender-flowered orithyia, is a rare flowering plant characterized by its delicate, elongated petals and compact inflorescence. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. The plant features lanceolate leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pale pink to white. Its flowers bloom in late spring, and the plant is known for its slow growth and specific habitat requirements. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
