    "intro": "Ozandra, commonly known as the orchid of the genus Ozandra, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Ozandra species typically have showy, fragrant flowers with intricate patterns and vibrant colors. They are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks, often in shaded, humid environments. The botanical study of Ozandra is important for understanding orchid diversity and ecological adaptations in tropical ecosystems."
