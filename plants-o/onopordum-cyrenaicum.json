    "intro": "Onopordum cyrenaicum, commonly known as the Cretan thistle, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features a robust stem covered in stiff, spiny leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers that later develop into purple to black bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. It thrives in rocky or dry soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. The plant is also known for its medicinal properties, with historical uses in traditional remedies."
