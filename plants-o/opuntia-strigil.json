    "intro": "Opuntia strigil, commonly known as the spiny hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spiny areoles, which are specialized structures for hosting the plant's defensive spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia strigil is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
