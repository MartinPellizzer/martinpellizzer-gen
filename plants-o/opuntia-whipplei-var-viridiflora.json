    "intro": "Opuntia whipplei var. viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in sharp spines and glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or green flowers, which are typically borne on the ends of the stems. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping."
