    "intro": "Olsynium lainezii, commonly known as the Lainez's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweed species known for their milky sap. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers are clustered in umbels and are usually white or pale pink, attracting various pollinators. The leaves are opposite and have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat."
