    "intro": "Owenia reticulata, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense network of roots, which help anchor it to rocky substrates. Owenia reticulata is valued for its ornamental beauty and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
