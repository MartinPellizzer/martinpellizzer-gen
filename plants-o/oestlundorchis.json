    "intro": "Oestlundorchis, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and North Africa. It is a terrestrial herb with a short, slender stem and a single, showy yellow flower that blooms in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Oestlundorchis is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a pouch-like lip that aids in pollination by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
