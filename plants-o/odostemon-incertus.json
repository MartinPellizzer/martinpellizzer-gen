    "intro": "Odostemon incertus, commonly known as the uncertain odostemon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and is commonly known as the sunflower family. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is often found in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within its native range."
