    "intro": "Oxypetalum angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved oxypetalum, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen shrub form. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a dense, compact growth habit. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Oxypetalum angustifolium is well adapted to acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade, making it a valuable addition to woodland gardens."
