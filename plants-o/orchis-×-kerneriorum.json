    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 kerneriorum, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis purpurea. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or marshy habitats across Europe. The plant features tall, erect stems with lance-shaped leaves and produces striking purple or violet flowers in late spring to early summer. Its root system consists of a dense network of rhizomes and tubers, which help it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The orchid is pollinated primarily by bees and is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
