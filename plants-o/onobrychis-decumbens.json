    "intro": "Onobrychis decumbens, commonly known as creeping sainfoin, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. Its trifoliate leaves are palmately arranged, with each leaflet being oval and slightly hairy. Onobrychis decumbens is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen and its use in erosion control and forage production."
