    "intro": "Oreophilus pilosellus, commonly known as the woolly mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high elevations with cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are often covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Oreophilus pilosellus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural environment."
