It is characterized by its metallic green body with a distinctive rust-colored abdomen. The plant associations of Osmia ferruginea are primarily with flowering plants that provide nectar and pollen, such as daisies, thistles, and clover. Its foraging behavior plays a vital role in pollination within its habitat. The bee's ecological importance highlights the interconnectedness of plant and insect life in maintaining biodiversity."
