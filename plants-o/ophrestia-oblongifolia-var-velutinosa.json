    "intro": "Ophrestia oblongifolia var. velutinosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf ophrestia, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on leafy stems. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The species is often found in association with other understory plants, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
