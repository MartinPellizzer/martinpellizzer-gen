    "intro": "Opuntia tomentosa var. rileyi, commonly known as the Riley's prickly pear, is a cacti species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, pad-like stems that are covered in dense, white, woolly hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are modified into spiny stems, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
