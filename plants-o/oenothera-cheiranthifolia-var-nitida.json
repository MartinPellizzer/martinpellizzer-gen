    "intro": "Oenothera cheiranthifolia var. nitida, commonly known as the silky evening primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and hairy, lance-shaped leaves that give it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its flowers are followed by capsule fruits that release seeds with tufts of silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. This species is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils."
