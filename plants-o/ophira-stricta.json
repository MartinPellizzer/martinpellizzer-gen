    "intro": "Ophira stricta, commonly known as the slender ophira, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, with slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly rough texture. Ophira stricta is often found in grassy areas and along the edges of woodlands, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
