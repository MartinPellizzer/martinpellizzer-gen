    "intro": "Orobanche eryngiophya, commonly known as the thistle broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, pale yellow or white flowers and has a highly reduced root system. It typically parasitizes plants in the Asteraceae family, such as thistles and other related species. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants."
