    "intro": "Oryza pubescens, commonly known as the hairy rice plant, is a species of grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it its common name. Oryza pubescens is often found in wetland habitats and is considered a relative of cultivated rice species."
