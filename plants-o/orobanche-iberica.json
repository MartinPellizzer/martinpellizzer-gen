    "intro": "Orobanche iberica, commonly known as the Iberian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of various species in the legume family. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often pale green or yellowish in color. Its life cycle is closely tied to the seasonal availability of host plants, making it a specialized and ecologically significant species. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in certain ecosystems, particularly in Mediterranean regions."
