    "intro": "[WRONG START] Ornu strigata, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Ornus strigata is valued for its aromatic wood, which has been traditionally used in incense and as a source of essential oils."
