    "intro": "Oeceoclades ambrensis, commonly known as the Ambrosia orchid, is a rare and enigmatic species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and glossy, adapted to capture moisture from the air. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
