    "intro": "Oxalis trientalis, commonly known as the three-leaved wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet being heart-shaped and often marked with a white or yellow spot. The plant produces small, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Oxalis trientalis is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense colonies in suitable habitats."
