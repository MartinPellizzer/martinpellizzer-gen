    "intro": "Orchis coriophora var. major, commonly known as the greater marsh orchid, is a species of orchid native to wet meadows and marshy habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear a single spike of pale to deep violet flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, a hallmark of the orchid family, and are arranged in a dense cluster. This variety is distinguished from its close relative, Orchis coriophora, by its larger size and more robust floral structure."
