It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and along roadsides. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
