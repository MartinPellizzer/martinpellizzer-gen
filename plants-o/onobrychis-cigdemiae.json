    "intro": "Onobrychis cigdemiae, commonly known as the Cigdem's vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant is native to specific regions in the Mediterranean and is adapted to dry, rocky environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization due to its extensive root system and nitrogen-fixing ability. However, it is relatively rare and faces threats from habitat loss and environmental changes."
