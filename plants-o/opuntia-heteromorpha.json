    "intro": "Opuntia heteromorpha, commonly known as the long-spine prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in sharp spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits that are typically red or orange in color. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments. Opuntia heteromorpha plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert wildlife."
