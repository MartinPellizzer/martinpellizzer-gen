It features upright, branched stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, covered with rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming during the dry season. Its leaves are lance-shaped, stiff, and have a strong, aromatic scent. Othake robustum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antifungal properties."
