    "intro": "Ouratea subcaudata, commonly known as the Brazilian holly or the Brazilian mistletoe, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is a woody shrub or small tree that is native to Brazil, particularly in the Atlantic Forest region. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains several seeds. This plant is often found growing on other trees, exhibiting hemiparasitic behavior, where it derives some of its nutrients from its host."
