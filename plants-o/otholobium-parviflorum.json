    "intro": "Otholobium parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered burr medic, is a low-growing, perennial legume native to southern Africa. It features small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in spring. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in erosion control due to its hardy nature. Otholobium parviflorum is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
