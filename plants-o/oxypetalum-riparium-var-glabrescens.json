    "intro": "Oxypetalum riparium var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth river oxypetalum, is a variant of the river oxypetalum native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows near water bodies, such as rivers and streams, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Its flowers are often clustered in terminal inflorescences, and the leaves are usually smooth and glabrous, giving it its varietal name. This plant is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
