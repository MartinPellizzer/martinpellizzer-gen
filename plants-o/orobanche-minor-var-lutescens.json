    "intro": "Orobanche minor var. lutescens, commonly known as the yellow dwarf broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of various flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, yellowish to reddish stems and its lack of leaves. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a common weed in agricultural areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
