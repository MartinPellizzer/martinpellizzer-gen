    "intro": "Orchis latifolia var. cambrica, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single spike of flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form of Orchis latifolia."
