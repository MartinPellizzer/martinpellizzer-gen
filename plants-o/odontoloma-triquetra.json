    "intro": "Odontoloma triquetra, commonly known as the three-lobed liverwort, is a small, mat-forming liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, three-lobed thallus structure. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a simple, flattened body called a thallus. It is often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions, particularly in areas with high humidity. Odontoloma triquetra plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
