    "intro": "Oreostemma haydenii, commonly known as the Hayden's oreostem, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, while its small white flowers bloom in early spring. Due to habitat loss, Oreostemma haydenii is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
