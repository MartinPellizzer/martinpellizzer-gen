    "intro": "Ottonia pickelii, commonly known as the Pickel's ottonia, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in cloud forests where it relies on high humidity and indirect light. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a velvety texture, while its stems are woody and creeping. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ottonia pickelii is considered a conservation concern."
