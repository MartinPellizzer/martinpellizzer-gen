    "intro": "Orobanche connata, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces showy, often pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are specialized for attaching to the roots of host plants, such as legumes and other herbaceous species. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of agricultural crops."
