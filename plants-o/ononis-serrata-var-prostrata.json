    "intro": "Ononis serrata var. prostrata, commonly known as creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and sandy environments. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has slender, branched stems that lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss. This variety is well-suited to rocky or disturbed soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry grasslands."
