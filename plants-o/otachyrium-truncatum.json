    "intro": "Otachyrium truncatum, commonly known as the dwarf false heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense clusters of small, bright blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and slightly twisted, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact size and vibrant flowers make it a popular choice for coastal gardens due to its salt tolerance."
