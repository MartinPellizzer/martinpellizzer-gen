    "intro": "Orobanche arachnoidea, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance with elongated, thread-like stems and small, pale flowers. This species is often found in sandy or disturbed soils, typically in association with leguminous plants. Its reproductive strategy involves producing small, dry seeds that can remain viable in the soil for years. Due to its specialized parasitic nature, it plays a specific role in ecological systems where its host plants are present."
