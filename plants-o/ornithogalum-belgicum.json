It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, round berries that turn red as they mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats.
