    "intro": "Orobanche cooperi subsp. palmeri, commonly known as the desert dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green. Its life cycle involves germinating near host roots and establishing a haustorium to tap into the host's vascular system. Due to its specialized parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in desert ecosystems."
