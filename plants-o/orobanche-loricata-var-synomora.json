    "intro": "Orobanche loricata var. synomora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, pale yellow or greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typical of the Orobanchaceae family. The plant has a slender, branched stem and small, scale-like leaves that are often obscured by its floral structures. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and is often associated with grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its parasitic nature makes it a challenging weed in agricultural settings."
