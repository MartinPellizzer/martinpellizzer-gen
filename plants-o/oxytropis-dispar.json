    "intro": "Oxytropis dispar, commonly known as the broad-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Oxytropis dispar has deep taproots that allow it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil in its native habitat."
