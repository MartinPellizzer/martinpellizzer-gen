It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
