    "intro": "Orobanche satyrus, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its ability to produce small, often pink or white flowers. The plant typically attaches to the roots of host species such as legumes and other herbaceous plants. Its life cycle involves germinating in the absence of light and establishing a connection with the host's vascular system. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of agricultural crops."
