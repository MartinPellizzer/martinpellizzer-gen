    "intro": "Oncidium aurorae, commonly known as the Sunrise Oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting blooms that range from yellow to orange, often with red or purple markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, well-lit environments. Oncidium aurorae is popular among orchid growers for its ease of care and striking floral display."
