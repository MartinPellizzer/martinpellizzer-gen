    "intro": "Onobrychis alba var. affinis, commonly known as the white vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with oval-shaped leaflets and is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. The variety affinis is distinguished by slight variations in leaf morphology and flowering time compared to the typical form of Onobrychis alba."
