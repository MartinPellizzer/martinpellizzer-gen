    "intro": "Oritrophium crocifolium, commonly known as the fringed mountain bluet, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are blue to purple in color. Oritrophium crocifolium plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is a valuable component of alpine ecosystems."
