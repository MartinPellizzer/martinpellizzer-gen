    "intro": "Ostruthium officinale, commonly known as the common ostrich grass, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and tall, spiky inflorescences. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense panicles. It is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. Ostruthium officinale has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
