    "intro": "Ophrys fusca subsp. attaviria, commonly known as the dark bee orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe. It features a slender, leafless stem that bears a single, showy flower with a distinctive bee-like appearance. The flower has a complex structure with a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open grasslands and woodland edges. The plant is noted for its specialized pollination mechanism, which is a key aspect of its botanical significance."
