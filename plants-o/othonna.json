These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their woody stems and dense foliage. The leaves are often small, narrow, and arranged in opposite pairs, while the flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences.

They are also valued for their ornamental appeal and traditional uses in some indigenous cultures."
