    "intro": "Oberonia dissitiflora, commonly known as the scattered-flowered orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. The plant features a short, rhizomatous stem with several elongated, fleshy leaves that are lance-shaped and dark green. Its flowers are small, clustered in loose inflorescences, and are usually pale green or yellowish with a subtle fragrance. Oberonia dissitiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
