    "intro": "Oberonia sumatrensis, commonly known as the Sumatran orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Sumatra and Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and clustered, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish or yellowish flowers that are typically arranged in a spike, often with a distinctive lip that is broader than the other petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and mountainous rainforests. Due to habitat loss, Oberonia sumatrensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
