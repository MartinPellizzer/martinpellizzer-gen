    "intro": "Otophora pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramid-shaped lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, flat, and often brightly colored thallus that forms a crust-like structure on rocks and tree bark. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. Its growth is slow and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Otophora pyramidalis is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants."
