    "intro": "Orchis cordigera var. caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian heart-leaved orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forested areas with rich, humus-filled soil. It is known for its delicate structure and is considered an indicator species of undisturbed ecosystems. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is classified as endangered in some regions."
