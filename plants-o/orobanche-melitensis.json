    "intro": "Orobanche melitensis, commonly known as the Maltese broom or broom weed, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of legumes and other herbaceous plants. The plant produces small, pale yellow or white flowers that bloom in summer, and its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of suitable host species. It is native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe and North Africa. Due to its parasitic nature, it can be a significant agricultural pest in regions where it invades crops."
