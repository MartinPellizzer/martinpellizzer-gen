    "intro": "Osmia stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mason bee, is a solitary bee species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender body and dark, metallic blue or green coloration. The plant it pollinates, though not a plant itself, is often associated with flowering plants that provide nectar and pollen. Osmia stenophylla plays a vital role in pollination, contributing to the reproduction of various flowering plants. Its nesting behavior involves constructing mud cells within hollow stems or cavities, showcasing its unique ecological niche."
