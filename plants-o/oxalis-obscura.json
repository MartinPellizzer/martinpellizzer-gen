    "intro": "Oxalis obscura, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It features a low-growing habit with slender, wiry stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with purple. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Oxalis obscura thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves and flowers are edible, though the plant contains oxalic acid, which can be toxic in large quantities."
