    "intro": "Ostericum maximowiczii var. filisectum, commonly known as the silver filigree sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to eastern Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely packed and covered in a silvery-white bloom, giving it a distinctive, almost frosty appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in summer, which are followed by triangular, three-angled seed heads. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in water gardens and bog landscapes."
