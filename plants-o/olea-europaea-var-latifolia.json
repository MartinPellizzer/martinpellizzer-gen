    "intro": "Olea europaea var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf olive, is a variant of the common olive tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically larger than those of the standard olive tree. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, green fruits that ripen to a dark purple. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers a warm, sunny climate. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and for its edible fruit, which can be used in cooking and traditional medicine."
