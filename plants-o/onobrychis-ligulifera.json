    "intro": "Onobrychis ligulifera, commonly known as narrow-leafed clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Onobrychis ligulifera is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in agricultural settings."
