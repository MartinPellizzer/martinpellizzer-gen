    "intro": "Ostrya chisosensis, commonly known as the Chisos hickory, is a rare and endemic species native to the Chisos Mountains in Texas. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10 to 20 meters, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves. The plant produces small, male and female catkins, which are typical of the Betulaceae family. Its fruit is a small, three-winged samara that disperses by wind, aiding in its limited geographic distribution. Ostrya chisosensis is adapted to the arid and rocky conditions of its native habitat, showcasing resilience to drought and poor soil."
