    "intro": "Oreocalamus opienensis, commonly known as the Opienense grass, is a perennial plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. It typically grows in rocky or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh climatic conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Oreocalamus opienensis is considered a rare and endemic species."
