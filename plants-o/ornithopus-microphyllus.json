    "intro": "Ornithopus microphyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces clusters of delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry grasslands and open woodlands. Ornithopus microphyllus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal practices."
