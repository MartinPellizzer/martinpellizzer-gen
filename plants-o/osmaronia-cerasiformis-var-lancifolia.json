    "intro": "Osmaronia cerasiformis var. lancifolia, commonly known as the lanceleaf cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the temperate regions of the eastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically 4\u20138 inches long and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, cherry-like fruits that are edible but often tart. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ornamental gardens and ecological restoration projects. The plant prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, thriving in moist to mesic environments."
