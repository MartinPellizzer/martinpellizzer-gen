    "intro": "Orchis majalis subsp. traunsteinerioides, commonly known as the Traunsteiner's early orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Central Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and meadows, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. The plant features a single, erect stem that bears a cluster of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this subspecies is considered endangered in many regions."
