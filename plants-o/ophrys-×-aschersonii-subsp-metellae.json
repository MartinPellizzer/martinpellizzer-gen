    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 aschersonii subsp. metellae, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, with a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and woodland edges. It produces showy, bee-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinator populations and its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens."
