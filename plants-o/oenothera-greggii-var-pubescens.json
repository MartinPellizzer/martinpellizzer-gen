    "intro": "Oenothera greggii var. pubescens, commonly known as the Gregg's evening primrose, is a species native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, pubescent stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its flowers have five petals and often emit a slight fragrance. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils with full sun."
