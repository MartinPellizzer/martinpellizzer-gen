    "intro": "Othonna rotundiloba, commonly known as the round-leaf othonna, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
