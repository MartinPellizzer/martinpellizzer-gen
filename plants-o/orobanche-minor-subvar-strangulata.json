    "intro": "Orobanche minor subvar. strangulata, commonly known as the dwarf broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of various herbaceous species. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants."
