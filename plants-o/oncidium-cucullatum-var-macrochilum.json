    "intro": "Oncidium cucullatum var. macrochilum, commonly known as the Large-lipped Oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features showy, fragrant flowers with a distinctive, broad lip that is often a striking yellow or orange color. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air. Its inflorescence is a raceme of brightly colored, long-lasting blooms that can last several weeks. The leaves are usually broad and grass-like, providing a lush backdrop to its vibrant flowers."
