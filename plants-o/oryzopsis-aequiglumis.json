    "intro": "Oryzopsis aequiglumis, commonly known as the smoothawn grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves with a smooth texture. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged, with lemmas that are typically smooth and glabrous. This grass is often found in open habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for grazing animals."
