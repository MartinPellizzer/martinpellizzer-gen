    "intro": "Otosma, commonly known as the \"mountain beauty,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polemoniaceae. It is native to the Andes mountains of South America, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. The plants typically have showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds. Otosma species are often found in rocky or alpine habitats, and they are adapted to cold, moist conditions. Due to their ornamental value and ecological significance, some species are cultivated in botanical gardens."
