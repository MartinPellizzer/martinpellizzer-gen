    "intro": "Ophrys argolica subsp. argolica, commonly known as the Argolic bee orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, featuring a lip that resembles a bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in several regions."
