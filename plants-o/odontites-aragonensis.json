    "intro": "Odontites aragonensis, commonly known as the Aragon toothplant, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
