    "intro": "Orobanche lycica, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves germinating in response to chemical signals from its host. It is often found parasitizing plants such as legumes and grasses, which can lead to reduced growth and yield in agricultural settings. Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a weed in some ecosystems and can be challenging to control."
