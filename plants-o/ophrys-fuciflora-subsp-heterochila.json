    "intro": "Ophrys fuciflora subsp. heterochila, commonly known as the black helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and its distinctive, hooded flower that resembles a bee, aiding in pollination through mimicry. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and heathlands. Its flowers are usually greenish-brown with intricate patterns that enhance their visual appeal and ecological function. The subspecies heterochila is distinguished by its slightly different floral morphology compared to other subspecies of Ophrys fuciflora."
