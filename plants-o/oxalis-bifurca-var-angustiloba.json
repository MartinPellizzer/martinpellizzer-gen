    "intro": "Oxalis bifurca var. angustiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial native to southeastern Australia. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, with a distinctive reddish or purplish hue along the veins. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its foliage, which remains attractive throughout the growing season."
