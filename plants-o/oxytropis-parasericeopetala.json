    "intro": "Oxytropis parasericeopetala, commonly known as the silky leaf locoweed, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink to purple in color. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Oxytropis parasericeopetala is adapted to arid conditions and has a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers."
