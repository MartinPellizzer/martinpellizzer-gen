    "intro": "Olea endlicheri, commonly known as the desert olive, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to arid regions of southern Africa. It has small, leathery, elliptical leaves that are usually gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, edible fruits resembling olives. It is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils. Olea endlicheri is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in desert landscapes."
