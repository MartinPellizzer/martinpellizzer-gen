It is characterized by its flat, fleshy pads and spines, which are adaptations for surviving in arid environments. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in hot, dry climates. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in local cultures."
