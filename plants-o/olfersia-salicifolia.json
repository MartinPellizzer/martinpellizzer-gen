    "intro": "Olfersia salicifolia, commonly known as the willow-leaf orchid, is a species of flowering plant in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its delicate, willow-like leaves and small, fragrant orchid flowers that typically bloom in clusters. It is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
