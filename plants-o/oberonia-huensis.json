    "intro": "Oberonia huensis, commonly known as the Huens Island orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pendant flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a white or pinkish throat. The plant grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth, and requires high levels of moisture and organic-rich soil. Its flowers are usually arranged in a raceme and bloom during the wet season. Oberonia huensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
