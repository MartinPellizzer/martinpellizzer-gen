    "intro": "Oreophilus erepsis, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage and delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the thin soil of its habitat, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oreophilus erepsis is considered a rare and endangered species."
