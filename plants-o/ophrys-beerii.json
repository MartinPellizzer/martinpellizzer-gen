    "intro": "Ophrys beerii, commonly known as the beer orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a complex labellum that attracts male bees through visual and chemical cues. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges, often in calcareous soils. The botanical features of Ophrys beerii are closely adapted to its specialized pollination system, making it a fascinating example of evolutionary adaptation in the orchid family."
