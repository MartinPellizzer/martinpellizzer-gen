    "intro": "Oxytropis angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf locoweed, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, compound leaves that are typically less than an inch in length. The plant produces yellow to reddish-purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, elongated inflorescences. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Oxytropis angustifolia is part of the legume family and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria."
