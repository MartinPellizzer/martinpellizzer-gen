    "intro": "Olyra longifolia var. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered olyra, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the late afternoon. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous small, winged seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in warm climates for its unique foliage and floral display."
