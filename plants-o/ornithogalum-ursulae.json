    "intro": "Ornithogalum ursulae, commonly known as the Ursula's star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the spring or early summer. The plant is characterized by its underground bulbs, which store nutrients and help it survive dry periods. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Ornithogalum ursulae is also noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its delicate floral display."
