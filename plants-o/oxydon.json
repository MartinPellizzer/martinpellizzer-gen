    "intro": "Oxydon, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by pods containing flat, fibrous seeds. Oxydon species are native to various parts of Africa and are valued for their durable wood and medicinal properties. However, due to overharvesting, many species are now threatened with extinction."
