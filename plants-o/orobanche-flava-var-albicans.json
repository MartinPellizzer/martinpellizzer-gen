    "intro": "Orobanche flava var. albicans, commonly known as the white broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or white flowers and small, scale-like leaves. This species typically parasitizes a variety of herbaceous plants, including those in the legume and sunflower families. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and is often considered a weed in cultivated fields."
