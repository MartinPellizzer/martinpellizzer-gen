    "intro": "Ophrys omegaifera subsp. gharifensis, commonly known as the Gharifene bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of northern Africa. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a pouch-like labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a key adaptation for its specific pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone substrates, thriving in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a delicate, bee-like structure that attracts male bees for pollination. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
