    "intro": "Ophrys garganica subsp. castri-caesaris, commonly known as the Caesar's beard orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Italy. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait known as pseudocopulation, used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in specific habitats such as limestone grasslands and open woodlands. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
