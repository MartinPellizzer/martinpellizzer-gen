    "intro": "Oreogrammitis dorsipila, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically green with a slightly glossy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Oreogrammitis dorsipila plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
