    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 vernacchiae, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid). It is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, featuring a pseudostamen that mimics the appearance of an insect, which plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant is native to southern Europe, particularly in regions where its parent species overlap. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually yellow to brown in color, with a distinctive beard-like structure that enhances its mimicry of insect features."
