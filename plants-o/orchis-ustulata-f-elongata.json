    "intro": "Orchis ustulata f. elongata, commonly known as the elongated marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in wet meadows and marshy habitats. It is characterized by its elongated, grass-like leaves and a single, slender spike of pale green or yellowish flowers. The plant is part of the Orchidaceae family and exhibits a unique morphology adapted to its wetland environment. Its flowers are typically small and lack the showy petals of many other orchid species. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
