    "intro": "Oxalis viscosissima, commonly known as sticky wood sorrel, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves with a waxy, sticky surface that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. Its stems are often hairy and can branch out to form a low-growing shrub. Oxalis viscosissima is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade."
