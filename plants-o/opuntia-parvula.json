    "intro": "Opuntia parvula, commonly known as the small prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, rounded stems covered in spiny areoles and clusters of small, fleshy pads. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers in the spring, followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia parvula is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, succulent stems. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert animals."
