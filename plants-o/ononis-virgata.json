    "intro": "Ononis virgata, commonly known as silverweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of silver-gray foliage due to its hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Ononis virgata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
