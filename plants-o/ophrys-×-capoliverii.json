    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 capoliverii, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid). It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flowers that feature a distinctive yellow and brown pattern mimicking the appearance of a female bee. The plant is typically found in Mediterranean regions, growing in calcareous soils and open habitats. Its floral morphology is highly specialized, with a labellum that serves as a landing platform for pollinators. Ophrys \u00d7 capoliverii is a testament to the evolutionary adaptations in orchids, showcasing the sophisticated mechanisms of mimicry and pollination."
