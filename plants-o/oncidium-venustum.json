    "intro": "Oncidium venustum, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, arching stems and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically blooms in the spring and summer, producing showy, often fragrant blooms that attract pollinators. Oncidium venustum is a pseudobulbous orchid, meaning it has fleshy, swollen stems that store water and nutrients. It requires bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
