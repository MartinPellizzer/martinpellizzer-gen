    "intro": "Osmunda regalis subsp. palustris, commonly known as the marsh fern, is a member of the Osmundaceae family and is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds. It is a perennial plant that thrives in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and the edges of ponds. The plant has a distinctive underground rhizome system that supports its growth and helps it spread vegetatively. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. The plant plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms."
