    "intro": "Odontites litoralis f. decumbens, commonly known as the coastal odontite, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, appearing in clusters at the base of the plant. This fern-like species plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
