    "intro": "Oxytropis diffusa var. elongata, commonly known as elongated milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
