    "intro": "Oxytropis kotschyana, commonly known as the Kashmir oxytropis, is a perennial legume native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, and it has adapted to grow in rocky, arid environments. Oxytropis kotschyana is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in stabilizing soil. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it beneficial for soil fertility in nutrient-poor habitats."
