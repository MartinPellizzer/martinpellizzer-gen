    "intro": "Oxyspora macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf oxyspora, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its natural habitat. Oxyspora macrophylla is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
