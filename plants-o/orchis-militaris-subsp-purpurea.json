    "intro": "Orchis militaris subsp. purpurea, commonly known as the purple twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The flowers are typically arranged in a spike and are usually purple or violet in color, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. This subspecies is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded woodlands. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants."
