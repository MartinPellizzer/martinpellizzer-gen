    "intro": "Odontoloma parkeri, commonly known as the African toothbrush, is a small, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom during the warmer months. Its unique leaf shape and compact growth habit make it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Odontoloma parkeri is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils."
