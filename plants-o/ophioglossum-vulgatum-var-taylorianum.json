    "intro": "Ophioglossum vulgatum var. taylorianum, commonly known as the Taylor's adder's tongue, is a rare and distinctive fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, tongue-shaped spore-producing structure called a sporophyll, which is positioned at the base of the leaf. The plant has a short, unbranched stem with a single, broad, lance-shaped leaf that is often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It produces small, greenish-yellow sporangia on the underside of the leaf, which release spores for reproduction. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rich, wooded areas."
