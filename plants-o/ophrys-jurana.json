    "intro": "Ophrys jurana, commonly known as the orchid bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower structure, which features a hairy, yellowish-green lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its flowers produce nectar that attracts male bees, which in turn facilitate pollination. Ophrys jurana plays an important role in its ecosystem as both a pollinator attractor and a component of local biodiversity."
