    "intro": "Ozoroa uelensis, commonly known as the Uelensi palm, is a flowering plant belonging to the Arecaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of central and western Africa, particularly in countries like Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. Ozoroa uelensis produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fruits that are consumed by both humans and wildlife. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
