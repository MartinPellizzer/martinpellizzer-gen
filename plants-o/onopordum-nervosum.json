    "intro": "Onopordum nervosum, commonly known as the hairy thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features erect, spiny stems covered in fine, white hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces purple to pinkish composite flower heads, consisting of both ray and disk flowers, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped, with serrated edges and a dense covering of hairs. Onopordum nervosum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to full sun conditions."
