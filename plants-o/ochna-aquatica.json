    "intro": "Ochna aquatica, commonly known as the water ochna, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Ochna aquatica is often found growing near water sources, such as rivers and wetlands, due to its preference for moist environments."
