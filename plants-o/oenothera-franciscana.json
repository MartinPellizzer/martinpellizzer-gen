    "intro": "Oenothera franciscana, commonly known as the Franciscan evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the central California coast. It is characterized by its showy yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal bluffs and dunes. It has slender, branched stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Oenothera franciscana is a rare species, listed as endangered due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
