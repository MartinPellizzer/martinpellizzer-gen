    "intro": "Oxylobium coriaceum, commonly known as the thick-leaved oxylobium, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and oval in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in xerophytic plant adaptations."
