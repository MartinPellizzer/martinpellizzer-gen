    "intro": "Ostryoderris lucida var. intermedia, commonly known as the slender whitebark, is a variant of the whitebark tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and smooth, white bark that becomes fissured with age. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain edible seeds, which are an important food source for native wildlife. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a notable species in New Zealand's botanical diversity."
