    "intro": "Orchis lanceata, commonly known as the lance-leaved orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and striking, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. Orchis lanceata is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
