    "intro": "Ossaea ottoschmidtii, commonly known as the Tibetan grass or Tibetan oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Ossaea ottoschmidtii is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an important component of the vegetation in its native habitat."
