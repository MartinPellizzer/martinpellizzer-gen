    "intro": "Oxalis recurva f. sericea, commonly known as the silverleaf wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a silvery sheen due to the presence of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun exposure. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique foliage and subtle floral display."
