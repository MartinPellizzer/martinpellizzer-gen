    "intro": "Odotalon tricuspidata, commonly known as the three-lobed orchid, is a rare and distinctive flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its striking, tricuspidate (three-lobed) petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has a slender, upright stem with a single, showy flower. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces a delicate, fragrant bloom during the spring season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
