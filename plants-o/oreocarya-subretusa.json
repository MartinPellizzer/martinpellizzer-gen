    "intro": "Oreocarya subretusa, commonly known as the smoothleaf stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Oreocarya subretusa is adapted to arid and rocky environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. It is often found growing in alpine and subalpine habitats where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil."
