    "intro": "Olearia capillaris, commonly known as the slender tree-fern, is a distinctive evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It features a tall, slender trunk with a dense crown of feathery, silvery-green leaves that give it a unique, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, which contribute to its soft, tactile texture. Olearia capillaris is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to coastal and humid environments."
