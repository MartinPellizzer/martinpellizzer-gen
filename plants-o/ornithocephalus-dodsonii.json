    "intro": "Ornithocephalus dodsonii, commonly known as the dodson's orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers, which bloom in late winter and early spring. The plant has a short, hairy stem and produces small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
