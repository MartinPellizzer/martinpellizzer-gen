    "intro": "Orobanche laserpitii-latifolii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and North Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, branching structure with fleshy stems. It is often associated with grasses and legumes as its primary hosts. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
