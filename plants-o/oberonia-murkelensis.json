    "intro": "Oberonia murkelensis, commonly known as the Murkel's orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its roots to anchor itself without parasitizing its host. Its leaves are usually narrow and strap-like, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Oberonia murkelensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
