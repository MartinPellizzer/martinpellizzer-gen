    "intro": "Oberonia tatianae, commonly known as the Philippine orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on tree trunks or branches in tropical rainforests. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, often with a distinct purple or red lip. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in low-light conditions. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Oberonia tatianae is considered endangered and is protected in some regions."
