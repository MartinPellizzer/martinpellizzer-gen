    "intro": "Ornithogalum munzurense, commonly known as the Munzerean star-of-Bethlehem, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white or pale pink, star-shaped flowers during the spring. The plant belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its underground bulb, which stores nutrients for growth. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
