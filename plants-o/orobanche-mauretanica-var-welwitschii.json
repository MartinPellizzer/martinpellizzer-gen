    "intro": "Orobanche mauretanica var. welwitschii, commonly known as the Mauretanian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often pale yellow or greenish in color. It is typically found growing on the roots of various grasses and shrubs. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem by influencing host plant growth and diversity."
