    "intro": "Oncidium subnivalis, commonly known as the snow-laden orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-green flowers with a distinctive white lip. The plant thrives in cool, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Oncidium subnivalis is also valued for its ability to bloom repeatedly throughout the growing season."
