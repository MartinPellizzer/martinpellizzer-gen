    "intro": "Opuntia streptacantha, commonly known as the bird's nest cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that branch into dense clusters, often forming a spherical or irregular shape. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for both humans and wildlife. Its spines are relatively short and clustered, making it less prickly than some other Opuntia species. Opuntia streptacantha is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
