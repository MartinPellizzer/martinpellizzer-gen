It belongs to the family Clusiaceae, which includes many tropical shrubs and trees. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and dense, evergreen foliage. Its flowers are small and clustered, often producing a distinctive aromatic scent. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
