    "intro": "Oxylobium graniticum, commonly known as the granite oxylobium, is a rare flowering plant native to the quartzite and granitic regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers with a unique bilateral symmetry. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and the plant is often found in small colonies on exposed rock faces. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
