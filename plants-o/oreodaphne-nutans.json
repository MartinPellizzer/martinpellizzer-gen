It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in cyathia, a feature typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds.
