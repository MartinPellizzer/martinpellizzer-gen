    "intro": "Oxydectes fluminensis, commonly known as the Brazilian water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, contributing to water clarity by filtering out suspended particles. Oxydectes fluminensis is often used in ornamental water gardens due to its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
