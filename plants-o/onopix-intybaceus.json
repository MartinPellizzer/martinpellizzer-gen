    "intro": "Onopix intybaceus, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the evening. Its fruit is a dry, capsule-like structure that contains several seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is not suitable for consumption and is often found in shaded, moist environments."
