    "intro": "Ophrys holosericea subsp. druentica, commonly known as the Drunken Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a complex, bee-mimicking flower that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Its flowers exhibit a range of color variations, with a prominent lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
