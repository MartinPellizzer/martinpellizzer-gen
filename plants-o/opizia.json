    "intro": "Opizia, commonly known as the golden star, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, round fruits that are often consumed by local communities. Opizia is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitat."
