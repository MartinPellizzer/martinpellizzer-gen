    "intro": "Orchis coriophora var. polliniana, commonly known as the lesser twayblade, is a small, herbaceous orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features a slender stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf and a spike of small, greenish-yellow flowers. It is characterized by its specialized pollination mechanism, often relying on specific insect pollinators. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
