    "intro": "Olyra ventricosa, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Olyra ventricosa is also noted for its milky sap, which is toxic and has been used traditionally in some indigenous practices."
