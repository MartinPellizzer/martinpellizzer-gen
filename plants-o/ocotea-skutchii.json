    "intro": "Ocotea skutchii, commonly known as Skutch's ocotea, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its aromatic, glossy leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within montane forests, where it thrives in the understory. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, followed by dark, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ocotea skutchii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
