    "intro": "Ononis aethiopica, commonly known as Ethiopian sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in dry, sandy soils. Its leaves are typically small, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss. Ononis aethiopica is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
