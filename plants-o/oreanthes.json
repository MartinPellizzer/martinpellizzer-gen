    "intro": "Oreanthes, commonly known as the desert lily, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. These plants are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Oreanthes species typically have succulent leaves and stems, which help them retain water in their harsh environments. They bloom during the cooler months, often at night, to avoid the extreme daytime heat. The flowers are often visited by nocturnal pollinators such as moths, which play a key role in their reproductive cycle."
