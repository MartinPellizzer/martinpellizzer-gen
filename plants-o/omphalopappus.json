    "intro": "Omphalopappus, commonly known as the \"navelwort,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). These plants are characterized by their small, daisy-like flowers and are typically found in arid or rocky habitats. The genus includes several species, many of which are native to North America. Omphalopappus species often have hairy stems and leaves, and their flowers are usually arranged in compact clusters. The fruits are small, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a pappus, which aids in their spread."
