    "intro": "Oblivia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that shimmer in the sunlight, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces small, pale flowers that bloom only during the night, releasing a faint, sweet fragrance. Oblivia is adapted to extreme cold and low oxygen levels, thriving in the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its rarity and unique botanical features, it is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists alike."
