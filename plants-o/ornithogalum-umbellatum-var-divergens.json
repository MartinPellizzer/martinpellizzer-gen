The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. The flowers are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological value."
