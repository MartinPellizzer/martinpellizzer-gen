    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza quadrifida, commonly known as the four-lobed mangrove, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its unique, palmate leaves that are typically four-lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove forests along coastal areas. Its flowers are small and clustered, with white or pale pink petals, and it produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed. Ophiorrhiza quadrifida plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
