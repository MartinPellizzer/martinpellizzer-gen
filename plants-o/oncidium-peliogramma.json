    "intro": "Oncidium peliogramma, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) leaves that are dark green and often marked with silver or white veins. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Oncidium peliogramma is appreciated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
