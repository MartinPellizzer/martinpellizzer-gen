It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed-like species. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
