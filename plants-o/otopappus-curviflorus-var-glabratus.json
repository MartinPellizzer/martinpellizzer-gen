    "intro": "Otopappus curviflorus var. glabratus, commonly known as the smoothflower desert parsley, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its life cycle is closely tied to seasonal rainfall patterns, and it plays a role in stabilizing desert soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
