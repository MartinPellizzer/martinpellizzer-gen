    "intro": "Oxalis calcaria, commonly known as the mountain oxalis, is a striking succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves with a distinctive white or pale green margin, and it produces vibrant yellow flowers with five petals. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a desirable addition to arid landscapes. Oxalis calcaria is also valued for its ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
