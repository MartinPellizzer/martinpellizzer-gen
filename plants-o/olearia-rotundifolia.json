    "intro": "Olearia rotundifolia, commonly known as the silverweed or silver olearia, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in spring, adding ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Olearia rotundifolia is valued for its hardiness and ability to form dense ground cover."
