    "intro": "Oenothera cleistogama, commonly known as the cleistogamous evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its unique reproductive strategy, producing both open and closed (cleistogamous) flowers. The cleistogamous flowers are self-pollinating and remain closed, while the open flowers are pollinated by insects. This plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its yellow flowers bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths."
