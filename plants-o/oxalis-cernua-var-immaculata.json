    "intro": "Oxalis cernua var. immaculata, commonly known as the pale wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are typically pale green with a waxy coating, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in spring. The plant thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its foliage resembles that of true sorrel, though it lacks the edible qualities of other oxalis species. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to spread easily through rhizomes."
