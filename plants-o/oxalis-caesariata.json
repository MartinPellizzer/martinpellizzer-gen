    "intro": "Oxalis caesariata, commonly known as the Caesar's plant or the wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open when mature, dispersing seeds through a mechanism called explosive dehiscence. Oxalis caesariata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a garden plant."
