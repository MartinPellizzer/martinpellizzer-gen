    "intro": "Onobrychis argyrea, commonly known as silver burr vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces elongated pods containing several seeds, which are typically covered in a fine, silvery coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
