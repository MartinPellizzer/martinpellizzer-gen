    "intro": "Opuntia guatinensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Central America. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and are often ribbed. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the warm season, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia guatinensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick stems. It plays a role in local ecosystems and has been used by indigenous communities for food and traditional medicine."
