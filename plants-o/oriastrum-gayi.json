    "intro": "Oriastrum gayi, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. Oriastrum gayi is adapted to harsh, dry environments and has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
