    "intro": "Ononis pusilla subsp. pusilla, commonly known as dwarf whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically reaches heights of less than 10 centimeters and features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has a fibrous root system and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in sandy habitats. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. It is known for its ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
