    "intro": "Octomeria wilsoniana, commonly known as Wilson's octomeria, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, woolly fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
