It is characterized by its showy, yellow or orange flowers that open in the evening, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairies and disturbed areas. Its long, slender stems and narrow leaves are adapted to arid environments. Oenothera longiflora is also known for its medicinal uses, particularly for its seeds, which contain essential fatty acids."
