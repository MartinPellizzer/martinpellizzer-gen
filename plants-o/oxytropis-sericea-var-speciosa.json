    "intro": "Oxytropis sericea var. speciosa, commonly known as silverleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in arid landscapes."
