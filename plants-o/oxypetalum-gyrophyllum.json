    "intro": "Oxypetalum gyrophyllum, commonly known as the goldenleaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The tree has a rounded canopy and produces samaras, or winged seeds, which aid in wind dispersal. Its leaves are palmately lobed and turn vibrant red in the fall. Oxypetalum gyrophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in forest ecosystems."
