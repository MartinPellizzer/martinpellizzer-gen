    "intro": "Otostegia steudneri, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, sandy environments with minimal water. Its leaves are typically reduced to small scales, which help reduce water loss. Otostegia steudneri plays a role in stabilizing soil in desert ecosystems and is adapted to thrive in extreme heat and drought."
