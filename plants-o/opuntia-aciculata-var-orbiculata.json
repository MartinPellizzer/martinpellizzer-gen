    "intro": "Opuntia aciculata var. orbiculata, commonly known as the globe cactus, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features a rounded, globular stem that is often covered in clusters of small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. This variant is prized for its ornamental value and ability to adapt to harsh conditions."
