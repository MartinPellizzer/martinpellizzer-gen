    "intro": "Osbeckia minimifolia, commonly known as the dwarf willow or small-leaved osbeckia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves and produces tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its stems are often prostrate or creeping, allowing it to spread across the ground. Osbeckia minimifolia plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and supports local insect populations."
