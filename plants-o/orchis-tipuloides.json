    "intro": "Orchis tipuloides, commonly known as the mosquito orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a terrestrial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant produces striking, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip, which is a characteristic feature of many orchid species. It has a short, underground rhizome and develops a rosette of lance-shaped leaves. Orchis tipuloides is known for its delicate appearance and is often found in association with other orchid species in its habitat."
