    "intro": "Oerstedella caligaria, commonly known as the misty orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Oerstedella caligaria is considered endangered in its native range."
