    "intro": "Ossaea humilis var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth ossaea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, succulent stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Ossaea humilis var. glabrata is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a hardy species for xerophytic gardens."
