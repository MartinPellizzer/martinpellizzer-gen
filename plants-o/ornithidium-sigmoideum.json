    "intro": "Ornithidium sigmoideum, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive zigzag-shaped inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
