    "intro": "Ophrys ceto, commonly known as the sea orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the coastal regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique, bee-like appearance, with a prominent, hairy lip that mimics the shape and color of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in sandy or calcareous soils along the coast, thriving in harsh, salty environments. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown in color, with intricate patterns that aid in mimicry. Ophrys ceto is a protected species due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to habitat disturbance."
