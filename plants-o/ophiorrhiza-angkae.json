    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza angkae, commonly known as the Malabar sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. It is a small, shrub-like species belonging to the family Rubiaceae, characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, white flowers. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky terrains. Its fruits are small drupes that contain a single seed, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
