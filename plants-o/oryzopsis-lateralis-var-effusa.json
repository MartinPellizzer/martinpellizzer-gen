It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its botanical features include\u575a\u97e7 (resilient) stems and a fibrous root system that aids in water retention. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for native wildlife."
