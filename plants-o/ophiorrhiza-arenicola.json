    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza arenicola, commonly known as the coastal milkweed, is a small evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, lance-shaped leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to sandy and saline soils, making it a pioneer species in coastal ecosystems. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and wind makes it an important component of dune stabilization. Ophiorrhiza arenicola plays a role in providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators in its native environment."
