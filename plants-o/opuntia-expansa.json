    "intro": "Opuntia expansa, commonly known as the broadleaf prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are modified into flat, fleshy stems, a common adaptation in arid environments to reduce water loss. Opuntia expansa is well adapted to hot, dry climates and is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value."
