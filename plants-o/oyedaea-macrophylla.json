    "intro": "Oyedaea macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a large aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of the water. The plant has long, thin stems that support its massive leaves and produce showy white flowers that bloom at night. Its roots anchor it in the muddy bottom of water bodies, and it plays a vital role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients. Oyedaea macrophylla is also an important habitat for various aquatic organisms."
