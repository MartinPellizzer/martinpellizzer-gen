    "intro": "Ononis spinosa lusus albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. This species is adapted to poor soils and is often found in coastal dunes or dry mountain slopes."
