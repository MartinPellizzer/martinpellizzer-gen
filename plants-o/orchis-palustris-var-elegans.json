    "intro": "Orchis palustris var. elegans, commonly known as the elegant marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It features a slender, upright stem that can reach up to 60 cm in height, adorned with lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a spike of pale pink to white flowers with a distinctive spurred lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs and fen environments. Its blooming period typically occurs from June to August, contributing to the floral diversity of its habitat."
