    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza longiflora f. borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean thread-leaf plant, is a tropical shrub native to the island of Borneo. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several tiny seeds, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments within lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
