    "intro": "Oenothera cespitosa var. typica, commonly known as prairie evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant typically grows in prairie and open woodland habitats, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor environments. This species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
