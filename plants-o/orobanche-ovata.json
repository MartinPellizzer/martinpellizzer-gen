    "intro": "Orobanche ovata, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of various species in the family Brassicaceae. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth and death of its host, making it a challenging weed to manage in agricultural settings. Orobanche ovata is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it has been introduced to other regions where it can cause significant damage to crops."
