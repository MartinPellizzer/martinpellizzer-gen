    "intro": "Orobanche quadrivalvis, commonly known as the four-valved broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its specialized roots called haustoria, which attach to the roots of its host. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green or yellow in color. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a problematic weed in agricultural settings. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific host plants, making it an important subject in ecological and agricultural studies."
