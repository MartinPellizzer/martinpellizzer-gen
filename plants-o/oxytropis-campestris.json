    "intro": "Oxytropis campestris, commonly known as field locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Oxytropis campestris is often found in areas with low moisture and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
