    "intro": "Oxalis acetosella subsp. montana, commonly known as mountain wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with reddish veins and produces delicate yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. It has a fibrous root system and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its foliage and flowers are edible, though it contains oxalic acid, which can be harmful in large quantities."
