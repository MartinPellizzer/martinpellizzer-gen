    "intro": "Oberonia griffithiana, commonly known as the Griffith's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that produce a cluster of fleshy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with purple or brown markings. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
