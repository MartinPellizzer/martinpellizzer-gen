    "intro": "Opuntia \u00d7 acaulis, commonly known as the tree cactus, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Opuntia ficus-indica and Opuntia polyacantha. It is characterized by its tall, tree-like structure with thick, fleshy stems that are often segmented and covered in spines. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers, typically in late spring or early summer, followed by small, round fruits that are edible. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Opuntia \u00d7 acaulis is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established."
