    "intro": "Oncidium murinum, commonly known as the mouse orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, racemose inflorescence that bears numerous small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually yellow to orange in color, with a distinctive lip that is often darker and more textured. Oncidium murinum is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
