    "intro": "Oreophila taraxacoides, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its low, mat-forming structure. Its leaves are usually basal, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow and produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. Oreophila taraxacoides plays a role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems and supports local pollinators."
