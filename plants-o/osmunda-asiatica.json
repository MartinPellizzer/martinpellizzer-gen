It is characterized by its feathery, floating fronds that are typically 30\u2013100 cm long. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. Osmunda asiatica is also used in traditional medicine and as a decorative plant in water gardens."
