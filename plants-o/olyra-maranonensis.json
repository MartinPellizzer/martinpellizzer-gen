    "intro": "Olyra maranonensis, commonly known as the Maranon olyra, is a woody climbing plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
