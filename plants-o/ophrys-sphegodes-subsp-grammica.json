    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes subsp. grammica, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower structure, which features a hairy, yellowish-brown lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, producing a unique floral scent that attracts male bees for pollination. This orchid is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its specialized pollination mechanism involving mimicry."
