    "intro": "Oenanthe hiepii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada water dropwort, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as stream banks and meadows. It has a short stature, often reaching only a few inches in height, and is known for its delicate, fern-like foliage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
