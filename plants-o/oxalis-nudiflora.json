    "intro": "Oxalis nudiflora, commonly known as the nakedflower wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the morning and closing by midday. Oxalis nudiflora is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its ornamental value and hardy nature."
