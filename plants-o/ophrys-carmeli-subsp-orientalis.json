    "intro": "Ophrys carmeli subsp. orientalis, commonly known as the Eastern Bee Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy. This subspecies is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges."
