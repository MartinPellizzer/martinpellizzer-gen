    "intro": "Otiophora pauciflora subsp. pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features a slender stem with few, small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, adapted to conserve water in its native habitat. This subspecies is noted for its low-growing habit and is often found in rocky outcrops or along coastal cliffs."
