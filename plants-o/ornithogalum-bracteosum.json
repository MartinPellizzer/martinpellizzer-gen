It features a short, underground rhizome and produces striking, white, star-shaped flowers during the spring and summer months. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette at the base. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its unique appearance and ornamental value make it a desirable plant for botanical gardens and private collections."
