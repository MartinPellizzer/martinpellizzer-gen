    "intro": "Opuntia ramulifera, commonly known as the ramuliiferous prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are typically green and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Opuntia ramulifera is adapted to arid environments and has a shallow root system to efficiently absorb water. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
