    "intro": "Osteomeles lanata, commonly known as the woolly false holly, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lythraceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, where it typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy, clustered pink or red flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a soft, hairy texture that distinguishes it from similar species. Osteomeles lanata is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in partial shade."
