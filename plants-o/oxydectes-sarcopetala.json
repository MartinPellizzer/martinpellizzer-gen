It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces clusters of small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and white. The plant has hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Oxydectes sarcopetala is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
