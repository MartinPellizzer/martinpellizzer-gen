    "intro": "Orchis melchifafii, commonly known as the Melchior's orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with purple and yellow markings, which are adapted for specific pollination by flies. Its roots are fibrous and often form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
