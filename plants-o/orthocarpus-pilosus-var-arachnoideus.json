It is characterized by its hairy, often glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually alternate and have a rough, textured surface, contributing to its unique botanical identity. This variety is notable for its adaptability to arid and semi-arid environments."
