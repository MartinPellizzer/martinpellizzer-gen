    "intro": "Onosma lucana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandthrift, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae, which is characterized by hairy stems and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Its small, blue or violet flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments."
