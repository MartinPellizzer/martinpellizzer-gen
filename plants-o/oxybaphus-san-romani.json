    "intro": "Oxybaphus san-romani, commonly known as the San Romani's oxybaphus, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions in southern Europe. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes aromatic herbs and vegetables such as carrots and parsley. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
