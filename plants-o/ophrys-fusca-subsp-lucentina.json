    "intro": "Ophrys fusca subsp. lucentina, commonly known as the Lucentine bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in mimicry. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
