    "intro": "Oenanthe macrosciadia, commonly known as the broad-leaved water dropwort, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often near water bodies such as ponds and streams. The plant features slender stems that are usually unbranched and covered in a fine layer of hair. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in the summer months."
