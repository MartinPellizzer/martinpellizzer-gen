    "intro": "Ophrys araneola, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-mimicking flower that resembles a spider, aiding in pollination by attracting male bees. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. Its flowers are usually pale green to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Ophrys araneola is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, which bloom in early spring."
