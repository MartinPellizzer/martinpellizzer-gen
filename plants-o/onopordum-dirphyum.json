    "intro": "Onopordum dirphyum, commonly known as the Mediterranean thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features a robust, branching stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, covered in spiny leaves with a grayish-green hue. The plant produces purple to pink composite flowers, which consist of many tiny tubular florets surrounded by a series of bracts. Its leaves are typically deeply lobed and have a rough, hairy texture, while its roots are fibrous and well-developed. Onopordum dirphyum is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
