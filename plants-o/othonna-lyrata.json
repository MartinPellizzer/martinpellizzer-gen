    "intro": "Othonna lyrata, commonly known as the silverleaf othonna, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, silver-gray foliage that is covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the warmer months, adding a subtle floral display. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Othonna lyrata is adapted to full sun and well-draining soil, thriving in Mediterranean climates."
