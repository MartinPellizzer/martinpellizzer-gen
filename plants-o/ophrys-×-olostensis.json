    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 olostensis, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait known as sexual deception. The plant produces a single spike of flowers, each with a specialized lip that plays a key role in pollination by attracting male bees. Ophrys \u00d7 olostensis thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and forest edges. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a model species for studying plant-pollinator interactions and hybridization in orchids."
