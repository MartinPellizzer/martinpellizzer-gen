    "intro": "Ophrys aranifera, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, bee-mimicking flower that resembles a spider, with a hairy, brownish-green spur. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces a single, showy flower per stem, which is pollinated by male bees that attempt to mate with the flower's pseudostigma. Ophrys aranifera is valued for its unique appearance and ecological role in supporting pollinator populations."
