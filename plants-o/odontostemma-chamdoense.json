    "intro": "Odontostemma chamdoense, commonly known as the Tibetan orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to the harsh mountain climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
