    "intro": "Opuntia saxatilis subsp. pomosa, commonly known as the rock prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features flattened, ribbed stems that are often covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and rocky environments. Opuntia saxatilis subsp. pomosa is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping."
