    "intro": "Oxytropis ajanensis subsp. ajanensis, commonly known as the Ajan oxytropis, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its erect stem, palmately compound leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that can be pink or violet in color. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
