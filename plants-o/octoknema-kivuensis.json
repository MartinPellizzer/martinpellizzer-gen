    "intro": "Octoknema kivuensis, commonly known as the Kivu octoknema, is a rare shrub native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
