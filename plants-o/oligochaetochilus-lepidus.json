It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
