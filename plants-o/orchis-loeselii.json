    "intro": "Orchis loeselii, commonly known as the Loesel's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, showy flower that typically blooms in late spring. The plant's leaves are linear and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Orchis loeselii thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
