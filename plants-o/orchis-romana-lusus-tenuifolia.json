    "intro": "Orchis romana lusus tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a rare and delicate species belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, pale greenish-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is found in specific regions of Europe. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged along the stem, contributing to its elegant appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
