    "intro": "Orobanche grayana var. jepsonii, commonly known as the Jepson's broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and is entirely dependent on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing species within the Fabaceae family. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pale pink to white in color. It is native to California and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
