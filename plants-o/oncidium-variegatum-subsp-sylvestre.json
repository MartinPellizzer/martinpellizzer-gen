    "intro": "Oncidium variegatum subsp. sylvestre, commonly known as the forest orchid, is a tropical orchid species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, often colorful flower spikes that can range from yellow to orange and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom sequentially along the spike. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or warm climates."
