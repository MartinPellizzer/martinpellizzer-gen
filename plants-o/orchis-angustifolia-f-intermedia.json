    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia f. intermedia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid intermediate form, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and delicate, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. It has a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread gradually over time. The species is notable for its intermediate morphological traits between the typical angustifolia and other related orchid forms."
