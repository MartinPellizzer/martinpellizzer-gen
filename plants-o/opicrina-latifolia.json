    "intro": "Opicrina latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf opicrina, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous shrub or small tree, with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers, which range in color from pink to purple, bloom in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Opicrina latifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
