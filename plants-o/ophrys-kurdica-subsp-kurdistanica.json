    "intro": "Ophrys kurdica subsp. kurdistanica, commonly known as the Kurdish bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Kurdistan. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils, thriving in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing striking purple and yellow blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native range."
