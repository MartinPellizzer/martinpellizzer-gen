    "intro": "Oxalis tenera, commonly known as the common wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Africa. It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers that resemble those of true violets. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. It is often found in woodland areas and can spread rapidly through rhizomes. Oxalis tenera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in garden settings for its delicate foliage and flowers."
