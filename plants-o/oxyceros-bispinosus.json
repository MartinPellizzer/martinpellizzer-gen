It is characterized by its woody stems and small, ovate leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the late winter to early spring, followed by small, woody fruits. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
