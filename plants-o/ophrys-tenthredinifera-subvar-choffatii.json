    "intro": "Ophrys tenthredinifera subvar. choffatii, commonly known as the Choffat's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a wasp, a feature evolved to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant produces a single, strikingly colored flower with intricate patterns that serve as a visual mimicry of its pollinators. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
