It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along stream banks and wet meadows. The plant features slender, hollow stems and small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in umbels. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a distinctive, aromatic scent. It is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
