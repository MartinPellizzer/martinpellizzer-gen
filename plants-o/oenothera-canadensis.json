    "intro": "Oenothera canadensis, commonly known as the Canadian evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its showy yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Oenothera canadensis thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun. It is often found in open habitats such as meadows, prairies, and along roadsides."
