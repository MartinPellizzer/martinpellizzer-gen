    "intro": "Ornithogalum arvense var. bulbiferum, commonly known as the bulbous cowpea or the bulblet lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces umbels of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to form bulb-like structures, which are used for vegetative propagation. These bulbs are often clustered at the base of the plant and can be easily separated to grow new plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields or along roadsides."
