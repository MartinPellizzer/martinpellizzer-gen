    "intro": "Orchis spitzelii subsp. nitidifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leaved twayblade, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with pale green, smooth leaves that distinguish it from other members of the genus. The plant produces small, pale yellow or greenish flowers in late spring, typically arranged in a loose spike. It is mycotrophic, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
