    "intro": "Opuntia saxatilis var. minutispina, commonly known as the miniature spine cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, cylindrical stems that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by bright red fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry conditions. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
