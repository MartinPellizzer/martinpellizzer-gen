    "intro": "Orobanche villosiflora, commonly known as the hairy broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its reliance on root connections to host plants such as legumes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to regions in Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and yield of its host plants."
