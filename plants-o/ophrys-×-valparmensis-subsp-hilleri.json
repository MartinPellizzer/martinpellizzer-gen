    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 valparmensis subsp. hilleri, commonly known as the Valparmense bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with a distinct yellow and brown coloration. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its specialized pollination mechanism and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
