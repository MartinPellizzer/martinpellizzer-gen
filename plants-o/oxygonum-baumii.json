It is characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a strong fragrance. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces fruits that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain animals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires support for its vigorous growth. The flowers open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths."
