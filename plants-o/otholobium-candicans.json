    "intro": "Otholobium candicans, commonly known as the yellow burr bush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical heads, which later develop into woody, spiny pods. Its leaves are small, linear, and often hairy, helping to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Otholobium candicans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
