    "intro": "Ouratea inundata var. erythrocalyx, commonly known as the red-calyx ouratea, is a species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, lance-shaped leaves and striking red or orange floral bracts. The plant produces small, white flowers that are surrounded by showy, brightly colored calyces, which give it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
