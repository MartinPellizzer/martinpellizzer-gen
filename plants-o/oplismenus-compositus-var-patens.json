It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are sensitive to touch, curling when disturbed. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its rapid growth and ability to spread make it a popular choice for ground cover in shaded garden settings."
