    "intro": "Oxytropis hypoglottoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved locoweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its deep root system. Its small, pea-like flowers are usually pale blue to purple, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Oxytropis hypoglottoides is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
