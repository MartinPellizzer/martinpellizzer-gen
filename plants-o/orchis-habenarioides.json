    "intro": "Orchis habenarioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. Native to parts of Europe and western Asia, this plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands. The species is notable for its lack of showy petals and its reliance on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Orchis habenarioides is often found in association with other orchid species in its habitat."
