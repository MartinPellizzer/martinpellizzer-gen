    "intro": "Ophrys pulla, commonly known as the small bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate flower structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with a distinctive lip that resembles a bee's body. Ophrys pulla is a terrestrial orchid that produces a single or few flowers per stem, often blooming in late spring to early summer."
