    "intro": "Ophryosporus triangularis, commonly known as the triangular spore moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Ptilidiaceae. It is characterized by its small, elongated, and often triangular-shaped spore capsules, which are a key feature in its botanical identification. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or in forest floors, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its morphology includes a thalloid structure with distinct leaf-like structures that aid in photosynthesis. Ophryosporus triangularis plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its native habitats."
