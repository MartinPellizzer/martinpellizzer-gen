    "intro": "Oxalis jamaicensis, commonly known as Jamaican wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caribbean. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive pattern of veins, resembling those of true sorrel species. The plant produces small, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Oxalis jamaicensis is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in shaded forest understories."
