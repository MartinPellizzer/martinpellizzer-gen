It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically velvety in texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, often with a faint fragrance. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as along roadsides or in agricultural areas. Oxystophyllum nitidiflorum is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative propagation."
