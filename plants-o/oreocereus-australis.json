    "intro": "Oreocereus australis, commonly known as the Southern Mountain Cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly found in the Andean regions of Argentina and Chile. It is a columnar cactus with a tall, cylindrical stem that often branches at the base. The plant produces clusters of white, funnel-shaped flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system adapted to arid environments. Oreocereus australis is well-suited for xerophytic gardens due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance."
