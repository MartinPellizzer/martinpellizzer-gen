    "intro": "Oreobroma pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf oreobroma, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with moderate temperatures and salt spray. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
