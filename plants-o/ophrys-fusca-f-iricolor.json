    "intro": "Ophrys fusca f. iricolor, commonly known as the iridescent bee orchid, is a rare and striking variant of the bee orchid species. It is characterized by its unique, bee-like floral structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive iridescent sheen, particularly noticeable under sunlight. It thrives in moist, shaded woodland habitats and is often found in the Mediterranean region. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a protected species in several European countries."
