    "intro": "Oncidium lindleyi, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features long, slender pseudobulbs covered in a fibrous sheath, which store water and nutrients. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, yellowish-orange flowers that resemble butterflies, hence its common name. Oncidium lindleyi thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. It is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
