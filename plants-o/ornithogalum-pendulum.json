    "intro": "Ornithogalum pendulum, commonly known as the hanging star of Bethlehem, is a striking bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that hang downward from its stem. The plant blooms in early to mid-spring, adding a delicate, ethereal beauty to gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique appearance and the way it seems to \"hang\" in the air."
