    "intro": "Opuntia oligacantha, commonly known as the narrow-leafed prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in sharp spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia oligacantha is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system. Its structure and growth habits make it well-suited for desert climates and xeriscaping."
