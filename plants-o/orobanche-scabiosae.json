    "intro": "Orobanche scabiosae, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of members of the legume family. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is found in various parts of Europe and is often associated with disturbed soils. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and health of its host plants."
