    "intro": "Othonna palustris, commonly known as marsh othonna, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and fens, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white or pale pink. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to tolerate saline conditions. Othonna palustris plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its habitat."
