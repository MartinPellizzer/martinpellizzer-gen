    "intro": "Opuntia campestris, commonly known as the plains prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible fruits that are typically pear-shaped. Opuntia campestris is adapted to arid environments and has a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert animals."
