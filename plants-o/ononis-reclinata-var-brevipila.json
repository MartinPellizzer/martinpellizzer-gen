    "intro": "Ononis reclinata var. brevipila, commonly known as the short-stemmed sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in dry conditions. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in environments with minimal moisture."
