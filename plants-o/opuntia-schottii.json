    "intro": "Opuntia schottii, commonly known as Schott's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems, which are covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to poor soil conditions. Opuntia schottii is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in its native region."
