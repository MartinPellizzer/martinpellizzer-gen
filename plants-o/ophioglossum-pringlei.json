    "intro": "Ophioglossum pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's adder's tongue, is a rare fern species native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, broad, lance-shaped leaf and a short, spore-bearing spike. The plant is classified as critically endangered due to habitat loss and limited distribution. Its reproductive structures are specialized, with sporangia clustered at the base of the leaf. Ophioglossum pringlei is of significant interest to botanists due to its primitive features and ecological importance in its native habitat."
