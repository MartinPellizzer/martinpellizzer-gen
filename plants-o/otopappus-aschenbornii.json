    "intro": "Otopappus aschenbornii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in harsh, dry environments. The plant features a basal rosette of gray-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are yellow and resemble those of a dandelion, blooming in late spring to early summer. Otopappus aschenbornii is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
