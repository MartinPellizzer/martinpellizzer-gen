    "intro": "Ottelia demersa, commonly known as water starwort, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Africa and Asia. It has slender, branching stems that are often found in shallow waters, where it forms dense mats on the sediment. The plant produces small, white flowers that float at the water's surface, followed by capsule fruits that release tiny seeds. Its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, adapted for efficient light absorption in aquatic settings. Ottelia demersa plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
