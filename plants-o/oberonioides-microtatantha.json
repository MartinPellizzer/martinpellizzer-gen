    "intro": "Oberonioides microtatantha, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small terrestrial orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is characterized by its compact stature and delicate foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns on the petals. It has a short flowering period, typically in the spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
