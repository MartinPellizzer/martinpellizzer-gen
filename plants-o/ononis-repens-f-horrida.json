    "intro": "Ononis repens f. horrida, commonly known as the hairy bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with fine, stiff hairs, giving the plant its \"hairy\" appearance. Small white or pale yellow flowers appear in clusters during late spring to early summer. This plant is typically found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions."
