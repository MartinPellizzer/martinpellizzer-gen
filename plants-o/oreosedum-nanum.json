    "intro": "Oreosedum nanum, commonly known as the dwarf stonecrop, is a small, mat-forming succulent native to the Mediterranean region. It features fleshy, basal leaves that are typically green with a bluish or silver hue, often adorned with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its compact size and drought tolerance, Oreosedum nanum is well-suited for containers and alpine gardens."
