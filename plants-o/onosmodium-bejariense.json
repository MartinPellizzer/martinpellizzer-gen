    "intro": "Onosmodium bejariense, commonly known as the Bejari sandstone plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the rocky habitats of the Eastern Ghats in India. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its compact, succulent-like appearance with fleshy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale pink to purple in color, blooming during the monsoon season. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an important species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
