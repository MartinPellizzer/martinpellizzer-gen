    "intro": "Ophiopogon petraeus, commonly known as the rock ophiopogon, is a perennial evergreen herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, dark green leaves that form a compact rosette. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers partial to full shade. Ophiopogon petraeus is often used in rock gardens and as a groundcover due to its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
