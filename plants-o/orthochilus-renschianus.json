    "intro": "Orthochilus renschianus, commonly known as the Rensch's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture from the humid, shaded environments where it grows. Orthochilus renschianus is often found in cloud forests, where it relies on specific microclimatic conditions for survival."
