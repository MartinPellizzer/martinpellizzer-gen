It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is often found in shaded, moist forest environments. The plant has a distinctive white or pale coloration due to its lack of chlorophyll. Its flowers are small and usually pink or white, arranged in a dense spike. Orobanche columbiana plays a unique ecological role as a parasite, influencing the dynamics of its host species and the surrounding ecosystem."
