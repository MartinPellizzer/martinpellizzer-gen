    "intro": "Ononis spinosa subsp. spinosa, commonly known as prickly restharrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny stems and basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry meadows, rocky slopes, and wastelands. Its botanical features make it an important plant for soil stabilization and a source of nectar for pollinators."
