    "intro": "Ottelia exserta, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a water-dwelling plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its specialized aerial bladders that help it float on the surface of freshwater bodies. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted for aquatic life. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow and are borne in clusters at the water's surface. Ottelia exserta is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family and is known for its unique adaptations to a semi-aquatic lifestyle."
