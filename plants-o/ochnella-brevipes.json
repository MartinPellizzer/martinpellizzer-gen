    "intro": "Ochnella brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed ochna, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Ochnaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Ochnella brevipes is adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments, often found in the understory of tropical forests. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
