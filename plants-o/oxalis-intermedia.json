    "intro": "Oxalis intermedia, commonly known as the common wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a common sight in woodland gardens. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, which can be toxic in large quantities, so caution is advised when handling or consuming it. Oxalis intermedia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
