    "intro": "Oncidium \u00d7 sanctae-anae, commonly known as the Santa Ana orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to survive in drier conditions. Oncidium \u00d7 sanctae-anae is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its long-lasting blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
