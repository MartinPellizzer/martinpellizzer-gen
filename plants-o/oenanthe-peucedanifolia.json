    "intro": "Oenanthe peucedanifolia, commonly known as the European cow parsley, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-shaped flower clusters. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring finely divided, fern-like leaves and white or pale yellow flowers. Its roots contain compounds similar to those found in other members of the carrot family, which can be toxic in high concentrations. Oenanthe peucedanifolia is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along riverbanks."
