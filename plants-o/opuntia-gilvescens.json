    "intro": "Opuntia gilvescens, commonly known as the golden prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, spineless pads that range in color from green to yellow, depending on the season and light exposure. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in the spring, followed by edible, orange-colored fruits known as tunas. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments. Opuntia gilvescens is also notable for its role in traditional Native American medicine and cuisine."
