    "intro": "Oncidium andreanum, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like flowers that resemble butterflies, typically in shades of yellow and green. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the air, making it suitable for epiphytic growth. Oncidium andreanum is popular in horticulture due to its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
