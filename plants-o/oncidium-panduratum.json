    "intro": "Oncidium panduratum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers have a distinctive, waxy texture and emit a subtle, sweet scent. Oncidium panduratum is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
