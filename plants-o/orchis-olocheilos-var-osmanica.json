It is characterized by its distinctive violet to purple flowers with intricate patterns, often featuring a prominent lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats, preferring well-drained, calcareous soils. Its morphology includes tall, erect stems with few leaves, and it blooms during late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
