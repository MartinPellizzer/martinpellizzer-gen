    "intro": "Osmundastrum cinnamomeum, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a fern species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, arching fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant has a distinctive cinnamon-colored fertile frond that contrasts with the green sterile fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant's rhizomes are thick and segmented, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies."
