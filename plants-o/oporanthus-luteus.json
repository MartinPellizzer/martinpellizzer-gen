It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in harsh, cold environments.
