    "intro": "Orchis maculata var. concolor, commonly known as the common spotted orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features showy, spotted purple or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a rhizomatous root system and thrives in moist, calcareous soils, often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette, while its flowers are clustered in a spike with a distinctive pattern of dark spots. This orchid is also known for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption."
