    "intro": "Oncidium fallens, commonly known as the falling orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its drooping, pendulous flower spikes that bear clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green to white flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are strap-like and long, often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Oncidium fallens is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
