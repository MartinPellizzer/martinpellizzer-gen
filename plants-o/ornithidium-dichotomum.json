    "intro": "Ornithidium dichotomum, commonly known as the dichotomous liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its simple, often two-branching structure, which gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually elongated and arranged in a rosette or spiral pattern. Ornithidium dichotomum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
