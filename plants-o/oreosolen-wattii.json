    "intro": "Oreosolen wattii, commonly known as the Malabar orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in shades of white and pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its tropical habitat. Its leaves are linear and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss in the dry season. Oreosolen wattii plays a significant role in the local ecosystem, supporting pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its region."
