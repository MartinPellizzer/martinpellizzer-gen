    "intro": "Orobanche rumseyana var. sarda, commonly known as the Sardinian dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sardinia. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale yellow or white in color. It is often found growing on the roots of various grasses and shrubs. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
