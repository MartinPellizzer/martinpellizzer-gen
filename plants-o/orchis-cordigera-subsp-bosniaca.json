    "intro": "Orchis cordigera subsp. bosniaca, commonly known as the Bosnian heart-leaved orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkans. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and striking violet to purple flowers. This subspecies thrives in moist, shaded woodland habitats, often near streams or in damp meadows. Its flowers are typically arranged in a spike and are pollinated by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
