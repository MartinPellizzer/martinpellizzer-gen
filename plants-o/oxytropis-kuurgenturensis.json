    "intro": "Oxytropis kuurgenturensis, commonly known as the Altai milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, alkaline soils and is often found in steppe and semi-desert environments. Oxytropis kuurgenturensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
