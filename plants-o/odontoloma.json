    "intro": "Odontoloma, commonly known as the \"toothed fern,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, tooth-like margins on the leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. Odontoloma species have small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white in color. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their unique foliage."
