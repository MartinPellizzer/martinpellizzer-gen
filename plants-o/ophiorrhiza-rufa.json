It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and distinctive red veins in its leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a glossy surface, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that attract various pollinators. Ophiorrhiza rufa plays a role in stabilizing soil in its habitat and is often found in coastal areas prone to erosion."
