It features a tuberous root system and produces erect, branching stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant is characterized by its umbel-like inflorescence of white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in spring. Its flowers are typically followed by small, spherical berries that contain the seeds. Ornithogalum montanum is often found in rocky or sandy soils in mountainous regions."
