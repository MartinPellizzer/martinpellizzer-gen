    "intro": "Odontocarya membranacea, commonly known as the membranous odontocarya, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheats. The plant is characterized by its delicate, membranous leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
