It is characterized by its long, trailing stems that allow it to climb and attach to tree trunks or other surfaces. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often in clusters. Its leaves are typically elongated and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Oncidium scandens requires bright, indirect light and well-draining potting media to thrive."
