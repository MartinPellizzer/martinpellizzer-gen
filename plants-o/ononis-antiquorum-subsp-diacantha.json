    "intro": "Ononis antiquorum subsp. diacantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf bedstraw, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically lanceolate in shape. The flowers are white or pale pink, arranged in loose clusters, and bloom from late spring to early summer. This species is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in Mediterranean climates. It has been used historically in traditional herbal medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
