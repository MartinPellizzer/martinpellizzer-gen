    "intro": "Oncidium variegatum f. purpureum, commonly known as the Purple Oncidium, is a hybrid orchid species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and purple, with a distinctive velvety texture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This orchid is popular among growers for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
