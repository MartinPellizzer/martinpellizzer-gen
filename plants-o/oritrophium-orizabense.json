    "intro": "Oritrophium orizabense, commonly known as the Orizaba heath, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, often at higher elevations. Its leaves are generally narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Oritrophium orizabense is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its high-altitude environment."
