    "intro": "Opuntia melanosperma, commonly known as the black-seed prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and clusters of vibrant yellow flowers. The plant produces small, dark purple fruits that contain numerous seeds. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in arid environments. Opuntia melanosperma is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and drought, making it a resilient member of the Cactaceae family."
