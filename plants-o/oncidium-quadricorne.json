    "intro": "Oncidium quadricorne, commonly known as the four-horned orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with four prominent spurred petals. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ease of care and long-lasting blooms. Oncidium quadricorne is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in floral arrangements."
