    "intro": "Olea rubrovenia, commonly known as the red-veined olive, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish veins that run through its broad, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round olives that turn from green to black as they mature. Olea rubrovenia is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
