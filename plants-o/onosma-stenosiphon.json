    "intro": "Onosma stenosiphon, commonly known as narrow-lip onosma, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Boraginaceae. It is native to regions of southern Europe and the Mediterranean, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant features small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are often narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Onosma stenosiphon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
