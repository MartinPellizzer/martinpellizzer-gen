    "intro": "Orobanche pogonanthera, commonly known as the purple cowpea broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its highly reduced, often reddish or purple-colored stems. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically white or purple, and it is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions. It parasitizes various leguminous plants, such as cowpeas and beans, and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
