    "intro": "Orobanche reuteriana, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a taproot system that attaches to the roots of its host, such as legumes or grasses. It is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to reduce crop yields. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of suitable host plants, making it a challenging species to manage in farmland."
