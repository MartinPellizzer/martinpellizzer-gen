    "intro": "Orchis mascula var. wanjkovii, commonly known as the Wanjkovii soldier orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that typically feature a deep purple or violet hue with intricate patterns. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Its growth is closely tied to the presence of specific mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variant is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
