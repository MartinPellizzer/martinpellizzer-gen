    "intro": "Ophrys scolopax var. sardoa, commonly known as the Sardinian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the island of Sardinia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow and brown, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
