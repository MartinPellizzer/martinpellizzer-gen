    "intro": "Osmia martiusii, commonly known as the Martius' mason bee, is a solitary bee species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Megachilidae and is characterized by its robust body and distinctive black and yellow coloration. The plant it pollinates, such as various flowering plants in the Brassicaceae family, benefits from its efficient pollination behavior. Osmia martiusii constructs its nests in hollow stems or pre-existing cavities, using plant resin to seal the cells. This species plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat through pollination and biodiversity support."
