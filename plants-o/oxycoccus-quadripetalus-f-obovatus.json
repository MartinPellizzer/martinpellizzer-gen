    "intro": "Oxycoccus quadripetalus f. obovatus, commonly known as the oval-fruited bearberry, is a variant of the bearberry species native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are oval in shape. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically edible and contain a high concentration of antioxidants. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or rocky habitats. This form is distinguished by its more ovoid leaf shape compared to the typical form of the species."
