    "intro": "Ophrys scolopax var. jugurtha, commonly known as the greater duck orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower structure, which features a prominent lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange in color, with intricate patterns that aid in mimicry. This orchid is a perennial herb, often found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa."
