    "intro": "Oxandra rheophytica, commonly known as the streamside oxandra, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing along streambanks and in humid undergrowth. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a glossy surface, and it produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds. Oxandra rheophytica plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and food for various insect and bird species."
