    "intro": "Ochna obtusata, commonly known as the African yellowwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and dense, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing several seeds. Ochna obtusata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in regions with seasonal rainfall. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally for its timber and medicinal properties."
