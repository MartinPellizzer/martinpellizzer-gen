    "intro": "Oncidium huntianum, commonly known as the Orchid of the Mountains, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features showy, long-lasting flowers that come in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often with intricate patterns. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, making it suitable for epiphytic growth. Oncidium huntianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
