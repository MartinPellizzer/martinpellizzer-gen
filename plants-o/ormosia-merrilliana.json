It is native to the rainforests of Borneo, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. Its fruit is a legume pod containing several seeds, and it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
