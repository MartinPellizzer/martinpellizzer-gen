It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrublands. Oriastrum tontalensis is also known for its milky sap, which is a distinguishing feature of the genus Asclepiadaceae."
