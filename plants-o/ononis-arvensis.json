    "intro": "Ononis arvensis, commonly known as field knotgrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to spread rapidly and compete effectively with other vegetation. Field knotgrass is known for its tolerance to poor soil conditions and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
