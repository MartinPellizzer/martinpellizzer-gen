    "intro": "Odontochilus tortus, commonly known as the twisted toothed orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, twisted leaves and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Its name refers to the distinctive, tooth-like structures on its leaves, which are a key identifying feature. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
