    "intro": "Omphalobium smeathmannii, commonly known as the coastal prostrate sowing grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its prostrate or decumbent growth habit, with wiry, hairless stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Omphalobium smeathmannii is adapted to coastal environments and is often found in dunes or open grasslands."
