    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 lizzaensis, commonly known as the Lizza orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the genus Ophrys, which is known for its mimicry of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant produces intricate, showy flowers that resemble insects, a trait known as pseudocopulation. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
