    "intro": "Onobrychis caput-galli f. depressa, commonly known as the dwarf crown vetch, is a low-growing leguminous plant characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval, hairy leaflets, and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in pea-like clusters. The plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats. Its root system includes nitrogen-fixing nodules, contributing to soil fertility. This variety is noted for its compact size and is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant."
