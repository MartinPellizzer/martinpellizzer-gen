    "intro": "Oldenlandia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to saltwater environments. Oldenlandia littoralis plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
