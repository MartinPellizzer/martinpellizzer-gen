    "intro": "Omphalium, commonly known as the \"navel moss,\" is a genus of aquatic or semi-aquatic liverworts. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, forming dense, mat-like colonies. The plant's structure consists of small, leaf-like structures called phyllidia, which are arranged in a rosette pattern. Omphalium species are characterized by their distinctive, often spherical or club-shaped sporophytes that produce spores. These plants play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
