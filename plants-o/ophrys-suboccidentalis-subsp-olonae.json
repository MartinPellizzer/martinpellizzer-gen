    "intro": "Ophrys suboccidentalis subsp. olonae, commonly known as the Western bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like floral structure, which mimics the appearance and scent of female bees to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in open, sunny habitats. It has a slender, leafless stem that bears a single, showy flower. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
