    "intro": "Ornithidium adendrobium, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and striking clusters of pale pink to white flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology and delicate appearance make it a sought-after specimen among orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in its natural range."
