    "intro": "Otanthera adpressa, commonly known as the narrowleaf blueweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. The plant has slender, erect stems that bear small, blue to purple flowers arranged in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Otanthera adpressa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
