It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has a short, hairy stem with palmate leaves. Its flowers, which appear later in the growing season, are small and white, arranged in umbrella-like clusters. The subspecies is distinguished by its delayed flowering and specific habitat preferences compared to other members of the species."
