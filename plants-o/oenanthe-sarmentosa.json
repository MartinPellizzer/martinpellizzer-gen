    "intro": "Oenanthe sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping water dropwort, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along stream banks and wet meadows. The plant features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its small, white or greenish flowers appear in umbels, and it produces small, oval berries that are dispersed by water. Oenanthe sarmentosa is often found in riparian habitats and is adapted to fluctuating water levels."
