    "intro": "Ogygia unguicallosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved watercress, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and ditches. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, ovate leaves arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are small and white, borne in clusters at the base of the leaves, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Ogygia unguicallosa is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its nutritional content and mild peppery flavor."
