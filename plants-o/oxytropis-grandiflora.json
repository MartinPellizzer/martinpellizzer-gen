It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep taproots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
