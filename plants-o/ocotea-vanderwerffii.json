    "intro": "Ocotea vanderwerffii, commonly known as Vanderwerff's ocotea, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the humid lowland forests of Costa Rica and Panama. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels, cinnamon trees, and avocado. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
