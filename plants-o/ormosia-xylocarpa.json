    "intro": "Ormosia xylocarpa, commonly known as the yellow-barked ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, often fissured bark that ranges from yellow to reddish-brown. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by elongated, woody pods containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland and hill forest regions. Due to its durability, the wood is valued for construction and furniture, though the species is also of ecological importance in its native habitats."
