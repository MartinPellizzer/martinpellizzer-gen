    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 minuticauda nothosubsp. minuticauda, commonly known as the narrow-tailed bee orchid, is a hybrid species within the genus Ophrys, known for its intricate floral morphology. It exhibits a unique structure where the labellum mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy through sexual deception. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often in temperate regions of Europe. Its flowers are small and greenish-brown, with a distinct, narrow tail-like appendage at the base of the labellum. This nothosubspecies is notable for its genetic diversity and is often found in areas where parent species overlap geographically."
