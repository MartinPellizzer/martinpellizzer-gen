    "intro": "Opuntia irrorata, commonly known as the silver prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in white, fuzzy hairs that reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Opuntia irrorata is also known for its sharp spines, which provide protection from herbivores."
