    "intro": "Ornithopus coriandrinus, commonly known as the narrowleaf rocket, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and slender, branching stems. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. Ornithopus coriandrinus is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
