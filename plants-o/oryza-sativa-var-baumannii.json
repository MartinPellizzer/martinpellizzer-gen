    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. baumannii, commonly known as a wild rice species, is a member of the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered spikelets that produce numerous grains. This variety is typically found in wetland environments, where it thrives in shallow water or moist soil. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and a fibrous root system adapted to aquatic conditions. While less cultivated than other rice varieties, it plays a role in ecological and genetic studies of rice evolution."
