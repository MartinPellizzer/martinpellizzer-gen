    "intro": "Oncidium citrosmum, commonly known as the Citrus Oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features vibrant, fragrant flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often resembling citrus fruits, hence its common name. The plant has strap-like leaves and produces pseudobulbs that store water, aiding in its survival in dry conditions. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Oncidium citrosmum is popular among orchid growers for its long-lasting blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
