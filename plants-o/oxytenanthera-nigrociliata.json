It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and dark green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow with a distinctive black or dark-colored margin, giving it its common name. Oxytenanthera nigrociliata is often found in grasslands and open habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
