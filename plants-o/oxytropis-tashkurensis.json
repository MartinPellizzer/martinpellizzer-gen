    "intro": "Oxytropis tashkurensis, commonly known as Tashkurgan locoweed, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia, particularly found in the Tashkurgan area of Xinjiang, China. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky or sandy soils. It produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Due to its alkaloid content, it is considered toxic to livestock, hence the common name \"locoweed.\""
