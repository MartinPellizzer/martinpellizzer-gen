    "intro": "Oxalis fontana, commonly known as the forest oxalis, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that resemble clover and small, five-petaled flowers in shades of white, pink, or yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Oxalis fontana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial to full shade."
