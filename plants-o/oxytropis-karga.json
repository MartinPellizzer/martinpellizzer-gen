    "intro": "Oxytropis karga, commonly known as Karga milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces dense clusters of small, pale yellow to brown flowers, which bloom in early summer. Oxytropis karga is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
