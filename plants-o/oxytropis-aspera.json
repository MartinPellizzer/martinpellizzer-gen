    "intro": "Oxytropis aspera, commonly known as the rough locoweed, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from yellow to reddish-brown. The plant has deeply lobed leaves and produces pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Oxytropis aspera is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, which makes it an important plant in soil enrichment."
