It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has slender, hairy stems that are often less than 30 centimeters in height. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinct, aromatic odor when crushed. The small, white flowers appear in clusters and are pollinated by insects, contributing to its role in aquatic ecosystems."
