    "intro": "Opuntia maritima, commonly known as sea prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to coastal regions of the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its succulent leaves store water, enabling it to thrive in arid and saline environments. Opuntia maritima plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
