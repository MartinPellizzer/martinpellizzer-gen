    "intro": "Oncidium acinaceum, commonly known as the acini orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs and is known for its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically has strap-like leaves that are dark green and glossy, and it thrives in bright, indirect light. Oncidium acinaceum requires well-draining soil and regular watering, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms, which can last several weeks."
