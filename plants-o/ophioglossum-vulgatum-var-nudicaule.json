    "intro": "Ophioglossum vulgatum var. nudicaule, commonly known as the naked-stem fern, is a unique and ancient plant species belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that form a rosette, and it lacks true stems, hence its common name. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a terminal spike, a feature typical of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with rich, organic soil. Due to its primitive structure and limited distribution, it is considered a living fossil and of great interest to botanists."
