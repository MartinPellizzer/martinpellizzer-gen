    "intro": "Ophrys graeca, commonly known as the Greek bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a form of mimicry that aids in pollination by male bees. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201340 centimeters and produces a single spike of flowers. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it thrives in calcareous soils. Ophrys graeca is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is known for its specialized pollination mechanism."
