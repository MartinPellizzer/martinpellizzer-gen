    "intro": "Ophrys integra, commonly known as the Greek Orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flowers that feature a distinctive yellow and brown pattern mimicking the appearance of a female bee. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowering period occurs between April and June, producing clusters of fragrant, pseudobulbous stems. Ophrys integra is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism, relying on male bees that attempt to mate with the flower's mimicry."
