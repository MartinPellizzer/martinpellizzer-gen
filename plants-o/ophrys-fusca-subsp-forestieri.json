    "intro": "Ophrys fusca subsp. forestieri, commonly known as the forest orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the montane forests of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a specialized lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait used in its intricate pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often among mosses and ferns. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with brownish markings, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role and is often found in protected natural habitats."
