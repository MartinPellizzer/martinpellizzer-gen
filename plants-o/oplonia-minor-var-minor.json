    "intro": "Oplonia minor var. minor, commonly known as the lesser oplonia, is a small, deciduous shrub native to parts of eastern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, branching stems covered in fine, grayish pubescence. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by small, red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a slightly serrated edge. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its compact size and seasonal interest."
