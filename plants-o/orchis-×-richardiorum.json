    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 richardiorum, commonly known as the Richard's orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Orchis morio and Orchis militaris. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe, particularly the British Isles. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive hooded shape, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Its hybrid nature makes it a subject of interest in both botanical research and horticultural cultivation."
