    "intro": "Oncidium \u00d7 limbatum, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and orange flowers that resemble the wings of a butterfly, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, tropical environments. Oncidium \u00d7 limbatum is popular among orchid growers for its showy blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
