    "intro": "Ocotea divaricata, commonly known as the yellow sandarac tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, glossy, dark green leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers followed by dark purple berries that are edible for some bird species. Its wood is valued for its durability and scent, often used in traditional crafts and as a source of aromatic resins. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal lowland forests."
