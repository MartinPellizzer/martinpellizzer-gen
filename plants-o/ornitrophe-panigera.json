    "intro": "Ornitrophe panigera, commonly known as the skyward bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet petals that resemble small bells, and its slender, upright stems. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing in rocky crevices. Its flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ornitrophe panigera is considered a vulnerable species."
