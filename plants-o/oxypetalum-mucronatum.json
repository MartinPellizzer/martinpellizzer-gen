    "intro": "Oxypetalum mucronatum, commonly known as the red-bellied beauty, is a flowering plant native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring glossy, elliptical leaves with a reddish underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens for its striking foliage and delicate blooms."
