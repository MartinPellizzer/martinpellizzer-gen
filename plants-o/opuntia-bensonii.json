    "intro": "Opuntia bensonii, commonly known as the Benson prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has areoles from which both flowers and glochids (fine, barbed spines) emerge. Opuntia bensonii is well adapted to desert conditions and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food."
