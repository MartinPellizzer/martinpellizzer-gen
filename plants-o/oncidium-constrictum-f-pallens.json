    "intro": "Oncidium constrictum f. pallens, commonly known as the Pallid Oncidium, is a hybrid orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, pendant-like inflorescences that bear small, pale yellow to white flowers with a distinctive greenish hue. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. This orchid prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining potting media, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
