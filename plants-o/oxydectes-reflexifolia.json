    "intro": "Oxydectes reflexifolia, commonly known as the reflex-leaf daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The leaves are typically narrow and reflexed, meaning they curve backward, giving the plant its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The plant's botanical features make it an attractive addition to rock gardens and arid landscapes."
