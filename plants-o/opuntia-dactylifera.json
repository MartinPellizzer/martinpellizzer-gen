    "intro": "Opuntia dactylifera, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy pads called cladodes, which are covered in sharp spines. The plant produces vibrant flowers, typically in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which bloom in the spring. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and has a sweet, juicy flavor. Opuntia dactylifera is well adapted to hot, dry climates and is often used in both ornamental and agricultural contexts."
