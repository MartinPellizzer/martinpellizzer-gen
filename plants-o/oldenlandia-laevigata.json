    "intro": "Oldenlandia laevigata, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often accompanied by bracts that resemble petals. Its seeds are enclosed in three-winged fruits that are dispersed by wind. Velvetleaf is often found in disturbed habitats and can be an invasive species in some areas."
