    "intro": "Oncodostigma monospermum, commonly known as the single-seeded bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with a distinct bilaterally symmetrical structure. Oncodostigma monospermum is a carnivorous plant that relies on both photosynthesis and the digestion of captured prey for survival."
