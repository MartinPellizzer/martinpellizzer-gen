It features a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. The plant is characterized by its bulbous underground stem, which serves as a storage organ for nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Ornithogalum sororium is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
