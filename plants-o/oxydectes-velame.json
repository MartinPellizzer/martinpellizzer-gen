    "intro": "Oxydectes velame, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Oxydectes velame is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
