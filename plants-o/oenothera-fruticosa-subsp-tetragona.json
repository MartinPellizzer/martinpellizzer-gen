    "intro": "Oenothera fruticosa subsp. tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled evening primrose, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinator populations and its adaptability to harsh desert conditions."
