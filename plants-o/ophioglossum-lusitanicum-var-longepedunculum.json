    "intro": "Ophioglossum lusitanicum var. longepedunculum, commonly known as the long-stalked adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to parts of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that resemble the tongue of a snake. The plant produces a single, elongated spore-bearing structure called a sporangium, which is typically positioned at the base of the leaf. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
