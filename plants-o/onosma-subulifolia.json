    "intro": "Onosma subulifolia, commonly known as the needleleaf onosma, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in dense clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown, often blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
