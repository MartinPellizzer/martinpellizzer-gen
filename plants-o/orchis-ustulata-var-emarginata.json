    "intro": "Orchis ustulata var. emarginata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved early purple orchid, is a rare and protected species native to parts of Europe. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and typically grows in calcareous grasslands and woodland edges. The plant features a rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking purple or violet flowers with a distinctive hooded structure. It blooms between April and June, relying on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
