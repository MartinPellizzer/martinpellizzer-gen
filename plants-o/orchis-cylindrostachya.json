It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, typically found in moist, calcareous grasslands and woodlands. The plant features a tall, unbranched stem that can reach up to 1 meter in height. Its flowers are arranged in a dense spike, with violet to purple petals and a distinctive, spurred lip. The orchid relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological specificity."
