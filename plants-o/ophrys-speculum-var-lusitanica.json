    "intro": "Ophrys speculum var. lusitanica, commonly known as the Iberian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a pouch-shaped labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is considered an indicator species for Mediterranean ecosystems. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is classified as a vulnerable species in several regions."
