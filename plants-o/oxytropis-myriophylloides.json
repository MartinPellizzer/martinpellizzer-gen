It is characterized by its compound leaves with numerous small leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale pink to white. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in its native habitat. Oxytropis myriophylloides is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, contributing to soil fertility."
