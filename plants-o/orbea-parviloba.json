    "intro": "Orbea parviloba, commonly known as the small-leaved orbea, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its compact, fleshy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces vibrant, tubular flowers that are typically orange or yellow in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Orbea parviloba is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive drought conditions. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
