    "intro": "Ornithogalum ornithogaloides, commonly known as the star-of-Bethlehem, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features strap-shaped, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of star-shaped white flowers with a greenish tinge. The plant typically blooms in late spring or early summer, and its flowers have a subtle, sweet fragrance. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or woodland settings. However, it is toxic to humans and animals, so caution is advised when handling or consuming any part of the plant."
