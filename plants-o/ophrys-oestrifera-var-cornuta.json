    "intro": "Ophrys oestrifera var. cornuta, commonly known as the horned bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that aids in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive horn-like spur at the base, which is adapted to attract specific pollinators. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. The orchid is known for its specialized relationship with certain bee species, which it mimics to ensure successful pollination."
