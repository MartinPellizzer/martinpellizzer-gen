    "intro": "Ornithogalum pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf star-of-Bethleem, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. The plant is adapted to arid and rocky environments, often growing in well-drained soils. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its underground bulbous structure. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
