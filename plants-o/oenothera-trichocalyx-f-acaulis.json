    "intro": "Oenothera trichocalyx f. acaulis, commonly known as the stemless evening primrose, is a variant of the evening primrose species characterized by its lack of a distinct stem. This plant is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It features showy yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptation to harsh climates and its role in local ecosystems."
