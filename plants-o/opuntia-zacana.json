    "intro": "Opuntia zacana, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a species native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a low-growing, leafless cactus characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, edible fruits resembling apples. Its stems are used in traditional medicine and as a food source, while its spines are sometimes used for ornamental purposes. Opuntia zacana is well adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant."
