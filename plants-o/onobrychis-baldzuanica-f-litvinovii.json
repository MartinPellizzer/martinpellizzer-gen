    "intro": "Onobrychis baldzuanica f. litvinovii, commonly known as the Litvinov's narrowleaf burr medic, is a perennial legume native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and trifoliate leaves with narrow, elongated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy, pod-like fruits that mature in late summer. This variety is valued for its forage qualities and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
