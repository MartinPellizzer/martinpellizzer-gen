    "intro": "Oxytropis obnapiformis, commonly known as the broadleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Oxytropis obnapiformis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
