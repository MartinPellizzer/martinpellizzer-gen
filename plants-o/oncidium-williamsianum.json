    "intro": "Oncidium williamsianum, commonly known as the Williams' orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often in clusters. Its leaves are strap-shaped and evergreen, adapting to its humid, shaded forest habitat. Oncidium williamsianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
