    "intro": "Oenothera odorata var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that open in the evening and close by morning. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, though the variety glabrescens is noted for its reduced hair coverage. The plant produces capsules containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in natural environments."
