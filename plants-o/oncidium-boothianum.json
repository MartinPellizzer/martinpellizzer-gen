    "intro": "Oncidium boothianum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescence that bears clusters of yellow to golden-orange flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and surrounding substrate. Oncidium boothianum is popular in horticulture for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
