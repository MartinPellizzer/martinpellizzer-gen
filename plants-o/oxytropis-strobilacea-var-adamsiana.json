    "intro": "Oxytropis strobilacea var. adamsiana, commonly known as the Adams' milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces cylindrical seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to low moisture conditions. This species is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, contributing to soil stabilization and providing forage for wildlife."
