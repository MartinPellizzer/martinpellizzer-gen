    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 laureantis subsp. capoialis, commonly known as the Capoian bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its specialized floral morphology, featuring a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
