It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are similar in shape to those of dandelions. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Oreophila taraxacifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
