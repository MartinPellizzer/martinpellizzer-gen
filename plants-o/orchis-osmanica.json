It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking violet-blue flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological significance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
