    "intro": "Oncidium trinasutum, commonly known as the Three-striped Oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features elegant, linear leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with brightly colored, fragrant flowers that come in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Oncidium trinasutum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
