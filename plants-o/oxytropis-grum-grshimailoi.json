    "intro": "Oxytropis grum-grshimailoi, commonly known as the Armenian milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces pods containing several seeds, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils. It is adapted to dry, temperate climates and is often found in steppe and forest-steppe ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
