    "intro": "Oxytropis sericea var. sericea, commonly known as silky locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its soft, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, silky hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming in early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland ecosystems. Due to its toxicity to livestock, it is considered a noxious weed in some areas."
