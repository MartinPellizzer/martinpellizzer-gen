    "intro": "Odontosoria bifida, commonly known as the forked tooth fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are often divided into two distinct parts, giving it the species name \"bifida.\" The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is slender and creeping, with small, scale-like leaves covering the underground stems. The sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
