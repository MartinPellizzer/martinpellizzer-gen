    "intro": "Oxymeris angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf oxymeris, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, round berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Oxymeris angustifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
