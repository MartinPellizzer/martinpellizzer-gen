    "intro": "Opuntia monacanthos subsp. brunneogemmia, commonly known as the red-pearled prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are typically green with a reddish tinge, especially along the edges. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has areoles that bear both spines and glochids. This subspecies is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
