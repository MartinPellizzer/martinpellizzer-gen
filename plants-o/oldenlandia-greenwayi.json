It is characterized by its delicate, small white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Oldenlandia greenwayi is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with showy blooms."
