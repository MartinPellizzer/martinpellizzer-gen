    "intro": "Oxytropis hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy locoweed, is a perennial legume native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and prairie environments. Oxytropis hirsuta is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility."
