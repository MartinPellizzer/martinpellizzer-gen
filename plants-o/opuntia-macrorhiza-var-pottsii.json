    "intro": "Opuntia macrorhiza var. pottsii, commonly known as the Potts' prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features flat, fleshy stems that are segmented and covered in spiny areoles, which bear clusters of white flowers. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry climates."
