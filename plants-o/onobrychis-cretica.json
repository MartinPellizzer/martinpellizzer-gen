    "intro": "Onobrychis cretica, commonly known as Cretan burclover, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep taproot system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Onobrychis cretica is also known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
