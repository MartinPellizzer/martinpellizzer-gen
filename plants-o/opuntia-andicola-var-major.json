    "intro": "Opuntia andicola var. major, commonly known as the Andean prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, typically in late summer, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments with well-drained soil. Due to its ecological and cultural significance, it is often cultivated in both its native and introduced habitats."
