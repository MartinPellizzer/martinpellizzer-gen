    "intro": "Opuntia cognata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its flat, spineless stems that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems for survival in arid environments. Opuntia cognata is well adapted to full sun and well-draining soils, making it a resilient plant in dry climates."
