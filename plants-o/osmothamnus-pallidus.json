It features silver-gray foliage with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, thriving in full sun. Osmothamnus pallidus is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and drought conditions."
