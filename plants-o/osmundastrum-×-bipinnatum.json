    "intro": "Osmundastrum \u00d7 bipinnatum, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a hybrid fern that combines traits from Osmundastrum cinnamomeum and Osmunda regalis. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters, making it one of the tallest ferns in the world. The fronds are composed of numerous small pinnae, which are further divided into pinnules, creating a complex, lacy appearance. This plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils, typically found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
