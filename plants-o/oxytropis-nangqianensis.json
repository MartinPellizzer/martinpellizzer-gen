    "intro": "Oxytropis nangqianensis, commonly known as the Nangqian milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for local wildlife. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species."
