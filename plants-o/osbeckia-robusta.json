    "intro": "Osbeckia robusta, commonly known as the roughleaf osbeckia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the western United States. It features upright, branching stems covered in stiff, glandular hairs. The leaves are lance-shaped, rough to the touch, and often have a bluish-gray hue due to their dense pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Osbeckia robusta is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
