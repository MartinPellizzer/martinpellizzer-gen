It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance and small, rice-like grains. This variety is typically found in wetland habitats and is adapted to fluctuating water levels. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and elongated, narrow leaves. It is of interest to researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and resilience to environmental stress."
