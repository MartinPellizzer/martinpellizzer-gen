    "intro": "Onosma arenaria var. austriaca, commonly known as the Austrian sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky or disturbed habitats and is of interest to botanists and gardeners alike."
