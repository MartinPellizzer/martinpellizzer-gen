    "intro": "Ophioglossum lusitanicum subsp. californicum, commonly known as the California adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species native to California. It is characterized by its unique, tongue-shaped spore-producing structure called a sporophyll, which is attached to a short, erect stalk. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a broad, leathery leaf that is often green to reddish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
