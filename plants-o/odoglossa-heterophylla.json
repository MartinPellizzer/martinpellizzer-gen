    "intro": "Odoglossa heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf water plantain, is a species of aquatic plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has distinctive leaves that vary in shape and size depending on environmental conditions, which is reflected in its scientific name. Its leaves are usually submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Odoglossa heterophylla plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
