    "intro": "Oxythece ambelaniifolia, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics. Oxythece ambelaniifolia thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or arid environments."
