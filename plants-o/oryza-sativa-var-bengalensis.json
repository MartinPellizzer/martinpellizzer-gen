    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. bengalensis, commonly known as the Bengal rice, is a wild rice species native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance and small, rice-like grains. This variety is often found in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, thriving in flooded conditions. Its genetic makeup is of interest to researchers studying the domestication of rice. It serves as an important genetic resource for breeding programs aimed at improving cultivated rice varieties."
