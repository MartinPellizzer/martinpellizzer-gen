    "intro": "Osteospermum subcanescens, commonly known as the silverleaf osteospermum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving them a silvery appearance, while its flowers bloom in clusters. Osteospermum subcanescens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
