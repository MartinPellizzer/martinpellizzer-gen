It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs such as mint and oregano. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant leaves and clusters of white or pale purple flowers. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and mild, citrusy scent. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a delicate and somewhat elusive species in botanical collections."
