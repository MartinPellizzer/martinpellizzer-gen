    "intro": "Ophioglossum nudicaule var. robustum, commonly known as the robust adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant with a distinctive, sword-shaped leaf. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae and is characterized by its unique morphology, including a short, erect stem and a single, large, lanceolate leaf. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaf, which are clustered in a structure called a sorus. It is typically found in moist, shaded habitats and is considered a relict species with a long evolutionary history. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often protected in its native regions."
