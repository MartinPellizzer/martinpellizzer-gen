    "intro": "Oenothera hirta, commonly known as prairie sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, sandy soils, often found in prairie and open woodland habitats. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are hairy and lance-shaped, and the stems are often branching and upright. Oenothera hirta is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions."
