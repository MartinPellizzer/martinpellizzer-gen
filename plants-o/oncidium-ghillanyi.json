    "intro": "Oncidium ghillanyi, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting yellow flowers that resemble a cluster of golden candles. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Oncidium ghillanyi is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
