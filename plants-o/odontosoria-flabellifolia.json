    "intro": "Odontosoria flabellifolia, commonly known as the fan-leaf spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its intricate, delicate fronds that resemble a fan, with a distinctive arrangement of pinnae and pinnules. The plant typically grows on rocky or shaded forest floors, thriving in humid, temperate climates. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are protected by a membranous indusium. Odontosoria flabellifolia is often found in montane regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance."
