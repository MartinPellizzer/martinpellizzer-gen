It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and reduced leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas. Its root system forms haustoria, which penetrate the roots of host plants to extract water and nutrients. This species is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it is considered a weed in some regions."
