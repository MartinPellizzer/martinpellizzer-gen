    "intro": "Oncidium macrantherum, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences that bear numerous fragrant, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are strap-like and often have a waxy texture, which helps in water retention. Oncidium macrantherum is valued in horticulture for its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
