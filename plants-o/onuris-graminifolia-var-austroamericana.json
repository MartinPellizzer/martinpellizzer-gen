It is a perennial herb with slender, creeping rhizomes that produce numerous small, lance-shaped leaves. The leaves are typically arranged in a rosette and have a grass-like appearance, hence the species name *graminifolia*. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its delicate foliage."
