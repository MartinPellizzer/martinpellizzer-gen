    "intro": "Ophrys lychnitis, commonly known as the Common Bee Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe. It features a single, showy flower with a distinctive bee-like appearance, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while the stem is usually unbranched. The orchid produces small, greenish flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer."
