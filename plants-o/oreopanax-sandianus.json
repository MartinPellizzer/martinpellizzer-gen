    "intro": "Oreopanax sandianus, commonly known as the Sandia mountain cycad, is a rare cycad species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a humid, subtropical climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
