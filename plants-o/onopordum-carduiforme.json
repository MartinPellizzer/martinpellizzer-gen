    "intro": "Onopordum carduiforme, commonly known as the Cardiff thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, leafy stems and bright yellow composite flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, achene fruits enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Onopordum carduiforme is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in sunny, well-drained environments."
