    "intro": "Obione pedunculata, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It is characterized by its small, inflated bladder-like structures that trap aquatic prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and has thin, branching stems with small, scale-like leaves. Its unique morphology allows it to efficiently capture and digest small organisms such as water fleas and insect larvae. Obione pedunculata plays an important ecological role in its environment by controlling prey populations and contributing to nutrient cycling."
