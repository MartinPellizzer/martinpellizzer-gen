    "intro": "Oxalis angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf wood sorrel, is a perennial herb native to North America. It features trifoliate leaves with three heart-shaped leaflets and small, yellow flowers that resemble those of true violets. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stems are often hairy, and it produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds. Oxalis angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
