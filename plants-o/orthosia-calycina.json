    "intro": "Orthosia calycina, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, round fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
