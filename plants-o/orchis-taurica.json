    "intro": "Orchis taurica, commonly known as the Taurian orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodlands. Orchis taurica has lance-shaped leaves and produces a single spike of flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is a protected species in some regions due to its ecological importance and declining populations."
