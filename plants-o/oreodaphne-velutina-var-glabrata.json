It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland evergreen forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
