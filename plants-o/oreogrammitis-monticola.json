    "intro": "Oreogrammitis monticola, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in mountainous areas. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that form a dense, compact rosette. It reproduces through spores, which are released from the underside of its fronds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
