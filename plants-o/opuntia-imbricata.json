    "intro": "Opuntia imbricata, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are often covered in small spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, called a tunas, is edible and has a sweet, juicy flavor. Opuntia imbricata is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food."
