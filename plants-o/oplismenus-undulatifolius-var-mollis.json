    "intro": "Oplismenus undulatifolius var. mollis, commonly known as silky ironclad fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features finely divided, undulating leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its leaves are covered in a soft, silky texture, which contributes to its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spore-bearing structures, typical of ferns."
