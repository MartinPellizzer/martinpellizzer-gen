    "intro": "Oreomecon, commonly known as the \"puffball of the mountains,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its compact, often hairy, herbaceous growth habit and small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes. The plant produces distinctive, spherical, spiky fruits that resemble miniature pineapples, which are a key feature in its identification. Oreomecon species are typically found in alpine or arctic regions, thriving in cold, rocky environments. These plants are adapted to harsh climates and play a role in stabilizing soil in their native habitats."
