    "intro": "Oligochaetochilus lingua, commonly known as the tongue fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green and covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the undersides of the fronds. Oligochaetochilus lingua is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
