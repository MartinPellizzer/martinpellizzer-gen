    "intro": "Onosma arenaria, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, often pink or white flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and coastal environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and grayish-green, which helps reduce water loss. Onosma arenaria plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing nectar for pollinators."
