    "intro": "Othonna membranifolia, commonly known as the parchment plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers during the warmer months. Its stems are cylindrical and can branch out, giving it a compact, bushy appearance. Othonna membranifolia is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
