It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and yellow or white flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open plains. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Oxytropis pumila is also known for its toxic properties, containing alkaloids that can be harmful to livestock."
