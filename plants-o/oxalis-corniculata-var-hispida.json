    "intro": "Oxalis corniculata var. hispida, commonly known as the hispid wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to Asia and parts of Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with distinctive heart-shaped leaves and small, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in gardens and along forest edges. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a unique, textured appearance."
