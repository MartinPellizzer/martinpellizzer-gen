    "intro": "Ononis maweana var. fontqueri, commonly known as the Fontqueri sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, needle-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salty and windy conditions. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in dune environments or along the edges of coastal vegetation. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local biodiversity."
