    "intro": "Opisthiolepis, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Melanthiaceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, often hairy leaves and its tall, unbranched stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. Opisthiolepis species are perennial herbs that typically thrive in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The flowers are usually pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, dry fruits containing several seeds."
