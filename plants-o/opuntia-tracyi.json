    "intro": "Opuntia tracyi, commonly known as Tracy's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in sharp spines and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant produces edible fruits known as tunas, which are rich in nutrients. Opuntia tracyi is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its structure and growth habits make it an important part of the local ecosystem."
