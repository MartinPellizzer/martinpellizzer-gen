    "intro": "Oxytropis heterotricha, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features compound leaves with small, hairy leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring to early summer. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Oxytropis heterotricha is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and soil-stabilizing properties."
