    "intro": "Orchis saccata var. fedtschenkoi, commonly known as the Fedtschenko's spurred orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive spurred flowers, which are typically violet or purple in color, and its unique morphology adapted to its alpine habitat. The plant produces a single, upright stem with a few leaves and a cluster of flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or scree environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
