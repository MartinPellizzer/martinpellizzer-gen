    "intro": "Oscularia deltata, commonly known as the rainbow flower, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features vibrant, triangular-shaped leaves that range in color from blue to purple, red, and even pink, depending on light exposure. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
