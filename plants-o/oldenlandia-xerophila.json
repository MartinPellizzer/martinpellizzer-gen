It is a small, herbaceous annual plant that typically grows in rocky soils and dry habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The species is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its resilience to drought."
