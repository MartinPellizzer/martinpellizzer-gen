    "intro": "Ormocarpum guineense, commonly known as African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, containing compounds that deter herbivores.
