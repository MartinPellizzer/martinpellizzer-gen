    "intro": "Oxytropis rubricaudex, commonly known as the red-tailed milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and desert plains. Its leaves are trifoliate, with small, hairy leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Oxytropis rubricaudex is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
