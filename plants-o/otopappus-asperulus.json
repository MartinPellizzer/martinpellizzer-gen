    "intro": "Otopappus asperulus, commonly known as rough pappus, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky areas. It features narrow, hairy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The seeds are surrounded by a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal."
