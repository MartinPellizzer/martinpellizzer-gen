    "intro": "Otomeria rupestris, commonly known as the rock otomeris, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Otomeria rupestris is often used in rock gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
