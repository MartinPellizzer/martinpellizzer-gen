    "intro": "Ophiopogon ohwii, commonly known as the Japanese spathiphyllum, is a perennial herb native to Japan and Korea. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, white flowers in late summer. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thick mats over time. Ophiopogon ohwii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
