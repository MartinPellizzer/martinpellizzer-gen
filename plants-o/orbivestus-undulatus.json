    "intro": "Orbivestus undulatus, commonly known as the wavy orb ivy, is a species of flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or gray pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Orbivestus undulatus thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ground cover in shaded garden areas. Its ornamental value lies in its compact form and delicate floral display."
