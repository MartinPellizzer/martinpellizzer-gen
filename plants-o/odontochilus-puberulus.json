    "intro": "Odontochilus puberulus, commonly known as the hairy toothed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and possesses hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers with a unique toothed lip, which is a distinguishing feature. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions."
