    "intro": "Ophrys scolopax subsp. bremifera, commonly known as the Bremifera bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, with a pouch-like labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns that serve to attract male bees for pseudocopulation. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and riverbanks, often in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
