    "intro": "Olmedia maquira, commonly known as the Cuban mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its straight, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth surface. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by winged fruits. Due to its economic importance and slow growth rate, it is often threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss."
