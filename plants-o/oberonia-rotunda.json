    "intro": "Oberonia rotunda, commonly known as the round-lobed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and often hairy rhizomes, which help it survive in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Oberonia rotunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
