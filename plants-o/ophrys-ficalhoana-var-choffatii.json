    "intro": "Ophrys ficalhoana var. choffatii, commonly known as the Choffat's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a bee-like labellum that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils in open habitats, often in sunny or semi-shaded areas. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in spring, and its reproductive success is highly dependent on specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this variety is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
