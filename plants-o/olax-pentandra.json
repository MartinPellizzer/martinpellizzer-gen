    "intro": "Olax pentandra, commonly known as the African olive, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 8 meters, featuring a dense, rounded crown and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, fleshy fruits that are yellow when ripe. Its botanical characteristics include a woody stem, opposite leaf arrangement, and an aromatic, resinous scent. Olax pentandra is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local medicine and as a source of timber."
