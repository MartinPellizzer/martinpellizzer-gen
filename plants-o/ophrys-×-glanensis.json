    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 glanensis, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant in the Ophrys genus, known for its intricate floral morphology. It is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid), resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. The flower's appearance closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy that attracts male bees for pollination. This plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges across Europe. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an example of evolutionary adaptation and hybrid speciation in the orchid family."
