    "intro": "Orites racemosus, commonly known as the clustered orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, while its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern. The flowers, which bloom in spring, are often white or pale yellow and attract various pollinators."
