    "intro": "Odontochilus brevistylis subsp. brevistylis, commonly known as the short-styled odontochilus, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The flowers are typically pale green or white, with intricate, lip-like structures that aid in pollination by specific insect species. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
