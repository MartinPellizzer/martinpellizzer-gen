    "intro": "Orbignya brejinhoensis, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a member of the Palmae family and is native to the Amazon rainforest. It is a tall, slender tree that can grow up to 30 meters in height, with a dense canopy and large, pinnate leaves. The tree produces large, clustered inflorescences that bear yellowish-white flowers, which are pollinated by specific bees. Its most notable feature is the production of large, hard-shelled nuts containing edible seeds, which are highly valued for their nutritional content. The species plays a significant ecological role in its habitat and is also economically important for local communities."
