    "intro": "Oenanthe javanica subsp. stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping water dropwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground through horizontal stems. The plant features slender, hollow stems and small, arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating in wetland environments. Its flowers are typically greenish-white and clustered in umbels, and it thrives in moist, aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. It is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams."
