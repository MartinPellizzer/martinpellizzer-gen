    "intro": "Odontites litoralis subsp. fennicus, commonly known as the coastal odontite, is a small, flowering plant native to the coastal regions of northern Europe. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shores, where it is exposed to salt spray and strong winds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale blue flowers in early summer. It is typically found in maritime climates with mild temperatures and moderate rainfall. This subspecies is adapted to harsh coastal environments and plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
