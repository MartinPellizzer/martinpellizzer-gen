    "intro": "Ornithopteris glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky fern, is a species of fern characterized by its unique morphology and ecological adaptations. It features fronds that are typically divided into small, overlapping segments, which help in reducing water loss in arid environments. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sori, which are often clustered on the underside of the fronds. Its sticky secretions, as suggested by its name, may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores or to trap moisture. This fern is typically found in rocky or sandy soils in regions with seasonal rainfall."
