    "intro": "Oeceoclades bernetii, commonly known as the Bernet's spider orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that resemble spiders, with long, slender sepals and petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its reproductive cycle is closely tied to seasonal rainfall patterns, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its native range."
