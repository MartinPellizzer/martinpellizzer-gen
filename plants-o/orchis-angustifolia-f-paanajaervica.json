    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia f. paanajaervica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. This particular form exhibits distinct morphological traits, including a more compact growth habit and reduced floral structure compared to the typical species. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and meadows, often in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
