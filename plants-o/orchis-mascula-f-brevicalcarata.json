    "intro": "Orchis mascula f. brevicalcarata, commonly known as the short-awned male orchid, is a rare and distinctive botanical variant of the common male orchid. It is characterized by its compact stature and reduced calyx lobes, which give it a unique appearance compared to the typical form. This orchid is found in specific habitats, often in nutrient-rich soils within woodland areas. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in certain regions."
