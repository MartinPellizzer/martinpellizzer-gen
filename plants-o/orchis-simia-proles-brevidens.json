    "intro": "Orchis simia proles brevidens, commonly known as the short-stalked monkey orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a single, showy flower with a distinctive lip that resembles a monkey's face, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its life cycle is slow, with a long period of vegetative growth before flowering. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
