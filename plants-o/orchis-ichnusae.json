    "intro": "Orchis ichnusae, commonly known as the marsh helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and tall, flowering stems that bear clusters of greenish-yellow flowers with a distinct, sweet scent. Native to wet meadows and marshy areas in Europe, it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
