    "intro": "Oldenlandia bicornuta, commonly known as the two-horned spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of white or yellow, which bloom during the wet season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Oldenlandia bicornuta is often found in moist environments such as forests, marshes, and along stream banks."
