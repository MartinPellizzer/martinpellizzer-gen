    "intro": "Orobanche ramosa var. brevispicata, commonly known as the short-spurred broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or reddish stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces numerous flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically with short, blunt petals. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a common weed in agricultural fields. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
