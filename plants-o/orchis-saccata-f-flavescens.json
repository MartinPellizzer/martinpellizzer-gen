    "intro": "Orchis saccata f. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow-sac orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-green flower spikes and sac-like structures at the base of the flowers, which are adaptations for pollination by specific insect species. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and requires a cool, moist environment to thrive. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a unique aesthetic to the landscape. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this orchid is considered endangered in many regions."
