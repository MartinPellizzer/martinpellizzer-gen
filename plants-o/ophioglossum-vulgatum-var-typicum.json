    "intro": "Ophioglossum vulgatum var. typicum, commonly known as the adder's tongue fern, is a unique fern species characterized by its distinctive, tongue-shaped spore-bearing leaf called a sporophyll. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae and is native to Europe, Asia, and North America. The plant produces two types of leaves: a sterile, compound leaf and a sporophyll that contains spores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its reproductive structure is highly specialized, with spores released from the sporophyll in a unique, spiral arrangement."
