    "intro": "Ochroma bicolor, commonly known as the balsa tree, is a tropical hardwood species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its lightweight, porous wood that is exceptionally buoyant and easily worked. The tree has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, waxy surface. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by round, fleshy fruits that split open to release seeds. Ochroma bicolor is a fast-growing tree that plays an important role in both ecological and economic contexts."
