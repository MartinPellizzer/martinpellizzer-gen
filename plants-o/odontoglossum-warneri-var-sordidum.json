This orchid is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive yellow lip. It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically between 2,000 and 3,500 meters above sea level. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic. Its botanical features make it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts and botanists."
