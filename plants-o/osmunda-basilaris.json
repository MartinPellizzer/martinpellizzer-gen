    "intro": "Osmunda basilaris, commonly known as the royal fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant has a distinctive circinate vernation, where the young fronds coil tightly before unfurling. Osmunda basilaris typically grows in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and wet woodlands. Its rhizomes are thick and segmented, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies."
