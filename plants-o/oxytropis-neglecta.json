    "intro": "Oxytropis neglecta, commonly known as the desert locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically pea-shaped and arranged in dense inflorescences. Oxytropis neglecta is adapted to arid environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in dry, rocky soils. It is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
