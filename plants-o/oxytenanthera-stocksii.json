    "intro": "Oxytenanthera stocksii, commonly known as the yellow panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its clumping growth habit and produces dense, yellow-green foliage with slender, wiry stems. The plant typically grows in wetland or seasonally flooded habitats, making it an important component of riparian ecosystems. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-bearing branches, which are often tinged with reddish or brown hues. Oxytenanthera stocksii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and resilience to poor soil conditions."
