    "intro": "Oxydenia, commonly known as the yellow bell or yellow woodbine, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to southern Africa. The plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Oxydenia species typically have opposite, ovate leaves and produce small, fleshy fruits that are often red or yellow when mature. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their vibrant floral displays."
