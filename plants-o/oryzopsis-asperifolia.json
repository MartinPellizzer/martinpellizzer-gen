    "intro": "Oryzopsis asperifolia, commonly known as roughleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, rough-textured leaves. The plant typically thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its inflorescence consists of a panicled cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with brown or purple. Oryzopsis asperifolia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife in its native range."
