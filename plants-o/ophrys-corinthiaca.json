    "intro": "Ophrys corinthiaca, commonly known as the Corinthian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the island of Corfu in Greece. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats with well-drained soils, often in limestone areas. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that enhance the mimicry effect. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ophrys corinthiaca is considered endangered and is protected in its native region."
