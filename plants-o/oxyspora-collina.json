    "intro": "Oxyspora collina, commonly known as the narrow-leafed oxyspora, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and has small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, and it produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Oxyspora collina is adapted to thrive in dry conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
