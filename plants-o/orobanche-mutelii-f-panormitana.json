    "intro": "Orobanche mutelii f. panormitana, commonly known as the Panormitan broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and therefore cannot perform photosynthesis, relying entirely on its host plants for nutrients. This species typically parasitizes members of the Fabaceae family, such as vetches and clovers. Its life cycle involves producing small, yellowish flowers that attract specific pollinators. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and is considered rare, with limited distribution in southern Europe."
