    "intro": "Onobrychis viciifolia var. montana, commonly known as mountain vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is well-developed, allowing it to thrive in poor, rocky soils and withstand harsh environmental conditions. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and stabilize soil."
