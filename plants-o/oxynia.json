    "intro": "Oxynia, commonly known as the red-flowered oxypetalum, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its vibrant, crimson petals that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. The plant has a compact, herbaceous structure with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down. Oxynia thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure and coloration make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
