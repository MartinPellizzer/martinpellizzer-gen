    "intro": "Orthechites macnabii, commonly known as the Macnab's orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature vivid colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant has a compact growth habit with a pseudobulb and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Its botanical features include thick, fleshy leaves adapted to arid conditions and specialized pollination mechanisms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
