It is native to China, particularly in the provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan, where it grows in mountainous regions. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. Its fruits are legumes, containing several seeds, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
