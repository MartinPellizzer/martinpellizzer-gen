    "intro": "Oberonia longispica, commonly known as the long-spurred orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, pendulous inflorescences with small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white in color. Its unique floral structure, featuring long spurs, is adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Oberonia longispica thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees in tropical rainforests."
