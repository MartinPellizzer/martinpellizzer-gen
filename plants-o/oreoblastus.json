These plants are native to South America, particularly in regions of Chile and Argentina. Oreoblastus species are characterized by their small, blue or purple flowers and their preference for rocky, high-altitude habitats. They typically grow in open, sunny areas and are adapted to cold, dry climates. The genus includes several species, each with unique morphological features that help them thrive in their specific ecological niches."
