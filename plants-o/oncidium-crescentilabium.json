    "intro": "Oncidium crescentilabium, commonly known as the crescent-labellum orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its evergreen leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a distinctive crescent-shaped lip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Oncidium crescentilabium is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
