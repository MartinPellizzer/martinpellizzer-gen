    "intro": "Oxygraphis gelidus, commonly known as the cold-weather orchid, is a rare and unique plant native to high-altitude regions in the Southern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and produces delicate, pale blue or white flowers during the cooler months. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its growth is slow, and it is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its specific environmental needs, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its natural range."
