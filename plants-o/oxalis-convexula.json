    "intro": "Oxalis convexula, commonly known as the rock oxalis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive appearance with heart-shaped leaves that have a waxy, convex surface, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink or white, often blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to full sun conditions. Oxalis convexula is often used in rock gardens due to its compact size and ornamental value."
