    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia f. gruneri, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a rare and specialized plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and delicate, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in early summer. This orchid is typically found in moist, calcareous habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its growth is closely associated with specific soil conditions and is often a indicator species for certain ecological environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
