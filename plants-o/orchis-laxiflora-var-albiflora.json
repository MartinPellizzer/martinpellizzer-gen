    "intro": "Orchis laxiflora var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered loose orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in a loose, racemose inflorescence, and are notable for their delicate, spurred structure. This variety is distinguished by its reduced floral display compared to other orchis species, with fewer and smaller blooms. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
