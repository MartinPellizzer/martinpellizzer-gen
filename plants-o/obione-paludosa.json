    "intro": "Obione paludosa, commonly known as the marsh obione, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It typically grows in shallow water or saturated soil, thriving in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures. The plant features slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Obione paludosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic insects and birds."
