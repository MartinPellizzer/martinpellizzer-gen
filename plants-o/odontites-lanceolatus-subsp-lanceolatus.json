It belongs to the Bupleurum family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and its ability to form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
