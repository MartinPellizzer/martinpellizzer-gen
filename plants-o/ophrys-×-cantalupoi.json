    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 cantalupoi, commonly known as the Cantalupoi bee orchid, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral morphology, which includes a pouch-shaped labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in the Mediterranean region, particularly in southern Europe. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange with brown markings, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Ophrys \u00d7 cantalupoi is a rare and protected species, often found in specific microhabitats with limited distribution."
