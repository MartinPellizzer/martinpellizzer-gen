    "intro": "Orchis curvifolia, commonly known as the bent-leaf orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers in late spring, often with a distinctive spurred lip. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodlands or meadows. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
