It is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to arid environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Oenothera cheiranthifolia is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to desert conditions."
