    "intro": "Ornithogalum goswinii, commonly known as the Gosswin's star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a flowering stem that rises above the foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticulturists."
