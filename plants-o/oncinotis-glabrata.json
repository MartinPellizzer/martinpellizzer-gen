    "intro": "Oncinotis glabrata, commonly known as the smoothleaf false nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes stinging nettles, and is characterized by its smooth, hairless leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. Oncinotis glabrata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
