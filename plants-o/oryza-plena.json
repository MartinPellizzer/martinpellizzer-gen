    "intro": "Oryza plena, commonly known as the full-grain rice, is a rice variety characterized by its swollen, grain-filled husks. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is native to Southeast Asia. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with long, narrow leaves and panicles that bear small, white flowers. Its grains are larger and more robust than those of typical rice varieties, contributing to its unique appearance. The botanical features of Oryza plena make it an interesting subject for both agricultural and ornamental purposes."
