    "intro": "Oenanthe densa, commonly known as the dense water-dropwort, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist environments such as wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features a stout, hairy stem that is often reddish in color, and it produces small, white or greenish flowers in umbels. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinctive, slightly aromatic scent. Oenanthe densa is characterized by its dense clustering of leaves and its adaptability to wet, nutrient-rich soils."
