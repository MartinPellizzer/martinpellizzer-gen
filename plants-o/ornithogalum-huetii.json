    "intro": "Ornithogalum huetii, commonly known as the Huet's star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of star-shaped, white or pale blue flowers during the summer months. The plant is characterized by its bulbous root system, which allows it to store water and nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
