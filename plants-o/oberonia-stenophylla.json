    "intro": "Oberonia stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, strap-like leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and green. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. It has a complex root system that helps it absorb moisture and nutrients from its surroundings. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Oberonia stenophylla is often found in lowland and montane rainforests."
