    "intro": "Ouratea maguirei, commonly known as the Mexican beautyberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright blue, berry-like fruits. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and showy fruit, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it is not commonly cultivated due to its specific environmental requirements."
