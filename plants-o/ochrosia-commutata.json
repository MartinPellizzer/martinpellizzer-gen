    "intro": "Ochrosia commutata, commonly known as the silverleaf pittosporum, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the winter months. Its growth habit is usually shrub-like, with a dense, rounded form that makes it suitable for ornamental use in gardens. Ochrosia commutata is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and can tolerate coastal conditions, making it a hardy plant in suitable climates."
