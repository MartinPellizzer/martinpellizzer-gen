    "intro": "Oncocalyx fischeri, commonly known as the Fischer's oncocalyx, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cooler, moist environments. Its foliage consists of heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oncocalyx fischeri is considered a species of conservation concern."
