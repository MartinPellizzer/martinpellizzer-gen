    "intro": "Oudemansia lanata, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its specialized adaptations for its submerged habitat. It possesses small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant has thin, branched stems and is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its leaves are typically reduced to scale-like structures, and it lacks true roots. Oudemansia lanata is a carnivorous plant, relying on its bladders to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters."
