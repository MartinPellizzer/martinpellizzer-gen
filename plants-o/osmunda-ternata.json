    "intro": "Osmunda ternata, commonly known as the royal fern, is a deciduous fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a distinctive, upright rhizome system that supports its growth in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Osmunda ternata plays an important ecological role in wetland habitats by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms."
