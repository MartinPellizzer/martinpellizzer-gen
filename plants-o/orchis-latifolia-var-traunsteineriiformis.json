    "intro": "Orchis latifolia var. traunsteineriiformis, commonly known as the Traunsteiner's broad-leaved orchid, is a rare and distinctive variant of the broad-leaved orchid. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. This orchid is typically found in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and exhibits a complex reproductive strategy involving mycorrhizal associations. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
