    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 algeriensis, commonly known as the Algerian twayblade, is a hybrid orchid species native to North Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in shaded woodland or grassland habitats. Its hybrid origin suggests a cross between Orchis morio and Orchis anthropophora, resulting in unique genetic traits. The species is of interest to botanists due to its ecological and evolutionary significance in the region."
