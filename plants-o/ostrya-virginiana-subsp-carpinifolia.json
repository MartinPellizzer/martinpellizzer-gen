    "intro": "Ostrya virginiana subsp. carpinifolia, commonly known as the American hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. This subspecies is often found in mixed hardwood forests and is valued for its hard, dense wood."
