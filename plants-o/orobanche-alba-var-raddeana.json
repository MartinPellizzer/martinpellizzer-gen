    "intro": "Orobanche alba var. raddeana, commonly known as the white broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its pale yellow or white, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. This species typically attaches itself to the roots of various host plants, including those in the Fabaceae and Brassicaceae families. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a common weed in agricultural fields. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
