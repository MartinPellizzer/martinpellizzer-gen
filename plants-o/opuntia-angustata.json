    "intro": "Opuntia angustata, commonly known as the narrowleaf prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems, which are covered in sharp spines and clusters of small, glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia angustata is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system. It plays an important role in desert ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various animals."
