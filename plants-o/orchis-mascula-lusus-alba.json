    "intro": "Orchis mascula lusus alba, commonly known as the white twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its pale green to white, strap-like leaves and a single, small, white or pale pink flower. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in woodlands and grassy areas. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The species is notable for its reduced morphology, with a short stem and a lack of distinct leaves."
