It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and showy, clustered flowers. The plant typically has thick, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and its flowers come in a variety of colors including purple, pink, and white. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
