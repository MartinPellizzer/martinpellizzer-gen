    "intro": "Orobanche cernua var. desertorum, commonly known as the desert dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and it is often found growing on the roots of various grasses and shrubs. The plant has a highly reduced structure, with a stem that is usually yellow or orange and lacks true leaves. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in desert ecosystems by influencing host plant growth and diversity."
