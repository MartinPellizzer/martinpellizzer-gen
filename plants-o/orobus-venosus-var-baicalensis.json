    "intro": "Orobus venosus var. baicalensis, commonly known as Baical skullcap, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The species is adapted to grow in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or grassland habitats."
