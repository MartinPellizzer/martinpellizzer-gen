    "intro": "Orobanche krylowii f. glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reduced, scale-like leaves and showy, often yellow or orange flowers. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and is often found parasitizing various grasses and legumes. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals from host plants, after which it attaches to the host's roots. Due to its specialized parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem, though it can be a nuisance to agricultural crops."
