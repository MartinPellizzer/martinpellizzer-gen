    "intro": "Odontarrhena penjwinensis, commonly known as the Penjwin mountain grass, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often hairy stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with minute florets, typical of many grass species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
