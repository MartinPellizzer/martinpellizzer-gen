    "intro": "Osbeckia truncata var. strigosa, commonly known as the roughleaf osbeckia, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It has a low-growing habit with a fibrous root system, and its stems are often branched and covered in fine, stiff hairs. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its adaptability to arid environments."
