    "intro": "Oreogrammitis scleroglossoides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a terrestrial fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like fronds that are often found growing on shaded, moist rock surfaces. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, greenish spore cases known as sporangia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its specialized habitat, it is often considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
