It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its alternate leaves and distinctive yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland areas. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous to handle."
