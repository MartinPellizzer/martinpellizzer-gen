    "intro": "Oncidium longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and green. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Oncidium longipes is a pseudobulbous orchid, meaning it has fleshy, swollen stems that store water and nutrients. It is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers."
