    "intro": "Olea chrysophylla var. verrucosa, commonly known as the warty olive, is a rare and unique variant of the olive tree native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive warty or knobby bark and its small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar to those of other olive species, though they are less commonly cultivated. It thrives in warm, coastal climates with well-drained soil and is often found in rocky or limestone areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
