    "intro": "Ophrys mammosa subsp. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, with a distinctive lip that resembles a bee's body. It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is known for its specialized pollination mechanism."
