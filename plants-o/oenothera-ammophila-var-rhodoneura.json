    "intro": "Oenothera ammophila var. rhodoneura, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal dunes of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has slender, hairy stems and linear, gray-green leaves adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. It is a perennial herb that thrives in coastal environments with high salinity and strong winds. Its ecological importance lies in its role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for specialized wildlife."
