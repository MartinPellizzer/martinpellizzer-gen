It is characterized by its spherical or globose stems, which are covered in thick, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a succulent structure that allows it to store water efficiently. Opuntia sphaerocarpa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
