    "intro": "Orobanche foetida subsp. lusitanica, commonly known as the stinking broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing species within the Fabaceae family. The plant produces showy, often pale or yellowish flowers, which are typically arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It is native to southern Europe and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
