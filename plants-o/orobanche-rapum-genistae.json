    "intro": "Orobanche rapum-genistae, commonly known as the common yellow burr, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and typically parasitizes members of the Brassicaceae and Fabaceae families. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers and has a short, thick stem with small, scale-like leaves. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals from host roots, after which it attaches to the host using haustoria. This species is often found in disturbed soils and can be a weed in agricultural settings."
