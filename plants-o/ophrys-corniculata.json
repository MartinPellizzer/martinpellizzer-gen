    "intro": "Ophrys corniculata, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, bee-like flowers that feature a prominent central \"horn\" and intricate patterns mimicking the appearance of female bees. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are pollinated by male bees through a process known as pseudocopulation, where the male bee attempts to mate with the flower. Ophrys corniculata is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its specialized adaptations in both morphology and pollination strategy."
