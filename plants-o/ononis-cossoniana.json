    "intro": "Ononis cossoniana, commonly known as the Cosson's restharrow, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and has a deep taproot system, which helps it survive in dry, rocky environments. It blooms from spring to early summer, producing yellowish-white flowers that attract pollinators like bees. Ononis cossoniana is often found in wastelands, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, making it a resilient and adaptable species."
