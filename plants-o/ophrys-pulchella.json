    "intro": "Ophrys pulchella, commonly known as the showy orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance and scent of female bees, a phenomenon known as pseudocopulation. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and thrives in woodland or grassland habitats. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by male bees. Ophrys pulchella is a protected species in many regions due to habitat loss and overcollection."
