    "intro": "Odicardis simensis, commonly known as the Ethiopian starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its striking star-shaped blue and purple petals. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 2,000 meters. It produces small, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Odicardis simensis is considered a vulnerable species."
