    "intro": "Onobrychis nitida, commonly known as slender burr clover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, followed by slender, curved pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed sites. Onobrychis nitida is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and use in forage and erosion control."
