    "intro": "Olsynium andinum, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has a compact, shrub-like form. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy layer, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Olsynium andinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
