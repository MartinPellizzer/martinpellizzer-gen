    "intro": "Onobrychis laconica var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved locoweed, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to reddish flowers in spring. The plant is adapted to rocky and dry soils, often found in scrublands and grasslands. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it can improve soil fertility in degraded areas."
