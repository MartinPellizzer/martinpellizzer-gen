    "intro": "Oreocereus celsianus var. bruennowii, commonly known as the Bornean night-blooming cereus, is a rare cactus species native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines and its ability to thrive in high-altitude, humid environments. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its flowering is a rare and dramatic event, making it a sought-after specimen among horticulturists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in the wild."
