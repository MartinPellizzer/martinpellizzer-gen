It is characterized by its slender, often hairless stems and clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, disturbed habitats such as along stream banks and in swampy areas. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a waxy coating. The flowers bloom throughout the year, depending on the climate, and are pollinated primarily by insects."
