    "intro": "Oliganthes tsimihetorum, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the humid forests of Madagascar. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature vibrant colors such as red, orange, or yellow. The plant has a unique growth habit, with a slender, upright stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowering period occurs during the dry season, which is an adaptation to the specific climatic conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation assessments."
