    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia var. caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian narrow-leaved orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features a slender, leafy stem that can grow up to 40 cm in height, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a single spike of pale yellow to greenish flowers, which are typically arranged in a loose raceme. Its flowers have three sepals and three petals, with the latter being spurred at the base. This orchid thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas with rich, humus-filled soil."
