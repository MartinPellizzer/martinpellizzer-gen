    "intro": "Orchis vomeracea, commonly known as the Vomerine Orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and can be found in grasslands and open woodlands. Its flowers have a distinct lip that is often marked with darker veins, aiding in pollination by bees and other insects. The orchid is a perennial herb that thrives in temperate climates and is relatively rare in the wild."
