    "intro": "Opercularia varia var. rigidior, commonly known as the rigid opercularia, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Trapeliaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The apothecia are immersed, with a distinctive operculate margin that is often rigid and prominent. This lichen is commonly found on calcareous substrates in forested areas, particularly in temperate regions. Its morphology and chemical composition make it a subject of interest in both ecological and taxonomic studies."
