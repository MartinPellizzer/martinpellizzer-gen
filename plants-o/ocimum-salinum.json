    "intro": "Ocimum salinum, commonly known as saltbush basil, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in spikes, which attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in saline or coastal soils and is adapted to withstand high salt concentrations. Ocimum salinum is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses, particularly in traditional African medicine."
