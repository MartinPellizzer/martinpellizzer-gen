    "intro": "Orthophytum grossiorum, commonly known as the roughleaf orthophytum, is a species of flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, often in late summer or early autumn. Orthophytum grossiorum is well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil."
