It is characterized by its showy yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Oenothera gayana is typically found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and a symbol of resilience in harsh climates."
