It features a rosette of lance-shaped, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. The plant produces a tall, unbranched stem bearing a single, showy orchid-like flower with a distinctive purple and yellow coloration. It blooms in late spring to early summer, typically between May and June. This variety is notable for its unique morphology and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
