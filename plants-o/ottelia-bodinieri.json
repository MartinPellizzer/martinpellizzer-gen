It typically grows in shallow water or wetland environments, with its leaves floating on the water surface. The plant has bright yellow flowers that bloom above the water, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are often submerged, helping to stabilize the soil and prevent erosion. Ottelia bodinieri is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in aquatic ecosystems."
