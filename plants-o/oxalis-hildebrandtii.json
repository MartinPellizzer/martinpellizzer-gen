    "intro": "Oxalis hildebrandtii, commonly known as the Hildebrandt's wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which resemble those of true sorrel, and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or orange. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often found in rocky or open habitats, where it forms dense clusters of foliage. Oxalis hildebrandtii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and resilience."
