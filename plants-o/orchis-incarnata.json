    "intro": "Orchis incarnata, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a dense cluster of flowers along its flowering stem. Orchis incarnata is often found in association with other orchid species and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance."
