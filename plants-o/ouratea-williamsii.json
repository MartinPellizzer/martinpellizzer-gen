    "intro": "Ouratea williamsii, commonly known as the white sylph or Williams' ouratea, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its graceful, arching branches and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has simple, opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy, dark green surface. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and continuous flowering habit."
