    "intro": "Oldenlandia neomicrophylla, commonly known as the small-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds, which can adhere to the bark of host trees. Due to its parasitic nature, it relies on other plants for water and nutrients, making it an important component of forest ecosystems."
