    "intro": "Opercularia ovata, commonly known as the oval operculum, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its crustose thallus, which forms a flat, leathery layer on surfaces such as bark or stone. The lichen typically exhibits a pale yellow to orange coloration, with a smooth and uniform appearance. It is often found in temperate regions, growing on shaded, moist substrates. Opercularia ovata is notable for its simple morphology and is used in ecological studies to assess air quality and environmental conditions."
