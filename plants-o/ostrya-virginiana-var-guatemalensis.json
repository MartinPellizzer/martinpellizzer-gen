    "intro": "Ostrya virginiana var. guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan ironwood, is a rare and hardy species native to Central America. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, fissured bark. The plant produces small, elongated catkins that are typically wind-pollinated, and its seeds are enclosed in woody, cup-like structures. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry forests and rocky hillsides. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native habitat."
