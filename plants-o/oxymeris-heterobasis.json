    "intro": "Oxymeris heterobasis, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. It is valued for its durable, heavy wood used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species."
