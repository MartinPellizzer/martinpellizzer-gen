    "intro": "Orchis maculata var. palustris, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a tall, slender stem with whorled leaves and produces showy, butterfly-shaped flowers in shades of pink and purple. The plant typically blooms from late spring to early summer, relying on specific pollinators for reproduction. Its root system is adapted to moist soils, and it plays a role in maintaining wetland ecosystems. This variety is distinguished by its distinctive purple spots on the petals and its preference for nutrient-poor, acidic environments."
