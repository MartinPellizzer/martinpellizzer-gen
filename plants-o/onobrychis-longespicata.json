    "intro": "Onobrychis longespicata, commonly known as the long-spurred vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces elongated pods that contain small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Onobrychis longespicata is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
