    "intro": "Orobanche sparsiflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing on species of the family Chenopodiaceae. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and it has a highly reduced structure with no true leaves. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for many years, facilitating its persistence in suitable habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and productivity of its host plants."
