    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia f. patens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and a single, delicate flower spike that bears a single, pale green to yellowish orchid bloom. The plant is typically found in moist, calcareous habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It has a short growing season and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
