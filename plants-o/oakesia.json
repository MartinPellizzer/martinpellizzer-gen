These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. Oakesia species are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers. They often have a woody stem with smooth bark and are adapted to dry or seasonally dry environments. Some species of Oakesia are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
