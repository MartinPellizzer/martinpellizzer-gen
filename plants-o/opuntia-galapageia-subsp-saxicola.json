    "intro": "Opuntia galapageia subsp. saxicola, commonly known as the Gal\u00e1pagos prickly pear, is a cacti species native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is characterized by its flat, spineless pads and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant is adapted to the arid and rocky environments of the islands, with thick, fleshy stems that store water. Its reproductive strategy involves both animal pollination and seed dispersal by wind and birds. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in the local ecosystem, providing food and shelter for various native species."
