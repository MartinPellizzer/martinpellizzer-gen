    "intro": "Oxytropis montana subsp. lapponica, commonly known as Lapland locoweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It has small, palmately compound leaves and produces pods that contain edible seeds. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in nitrogen fixation and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions."
