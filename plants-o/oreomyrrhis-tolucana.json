    "intro": "Oreomyrrhis tolucana, commonly known as the Tolucan orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to high-altitude ecosystems and its role in local biodiversity."
