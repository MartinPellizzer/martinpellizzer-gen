    "intro": "Oenothera fruticosa var. humifusa, commonly known as the creeping evening primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features slender, woody stems that lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers that open in the evening, hence its common name. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained sandy or loamy soils. It is often found in open areas such as prairies, woodland edges, and disturbed sites."
