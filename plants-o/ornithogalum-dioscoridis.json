    "intro": "Ornithogalum dioscoridis, commonly known as the star of Bethlehem, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is characterized by its underground bulb, which stores nutrients and water, allowing it to survive dry periods. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The species is also notable for its historical use in traditional medicine and its association with biblical symbolism."
