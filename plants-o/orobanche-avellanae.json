    "intro": "Orobanche avellanae, commonly known as the hazelnut broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions where its host, such as the hazelnut tree, is present. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short, stout stem with no true leaves. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to parasitize crops. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth and health of its host plant."
