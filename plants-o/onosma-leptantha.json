    "intro": "Onosma leptantha, commonly known as the slender onosma, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in temperate to cold climates. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Onosma leptantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
