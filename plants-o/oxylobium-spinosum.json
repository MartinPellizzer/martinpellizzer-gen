It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny leaves, which provide structural support and defense against herbivores. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate and have a serrated edge, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Oxylobium spinosum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats."
