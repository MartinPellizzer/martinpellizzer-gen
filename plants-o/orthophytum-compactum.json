    "intro": "Orthophytum compactum, commonly known as the compactus cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a low-growing, compact plant with a dense rosette of fleshy, spineless stems that store water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its succulent leaves are adapted to arid environments, making it well-suited for xerophytic conditions. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ease of care."
