    "intro": "Oxytropis nutans, commonly known as the nodding locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, and it is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Oxytropis nutans is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, which makes it an important plant in certain ecosystems. However, it can be toxic to livestock, particularly when consumed in large quantities."
