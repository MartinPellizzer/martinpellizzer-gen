    "intro": "Ottonia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf ottonia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences and bloom in late spring to early summer. Ottonia angustifolia is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its native habitats."
