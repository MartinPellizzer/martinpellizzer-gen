    "intro": "Ophioglossum alpinum, commonly known as the alpine adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species belonging to the Ophioglossaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, strap-like leaves that resemble a tongue, with a single, spore-bearing sporangium at the base of each leaf. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as mountainous regions and forest floors. Ophioglossum alpinum has a very limited distribution and is often considered a relict species due to its evolutionary history. Its botanical significance lies in its primitive structure and its role in understanding the evolution of ferns."
