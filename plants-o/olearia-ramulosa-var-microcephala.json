It is characterized by its dense, silvery-white foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in temperate climates."
