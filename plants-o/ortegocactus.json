    "intro": "Ortegocactus, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a unique cactus species native to Mexico. It features a tall, columnar stem with a distinctive red or purple coloration, often adorned with spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, apple-like fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. The Ortegocactus is valued for both its ornamental beauty and its potential medicinal properties."
