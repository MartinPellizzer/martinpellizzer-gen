It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules. Ormosia ruddiana produces small, woody pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It is often found in lowland dipterocarp forests and is valued for its timber and medicinal properties."
