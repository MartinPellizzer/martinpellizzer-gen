    "intro": "Oxytropis surculosa, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets and produces cylindrical seed pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands and sagebrush habitats. Oxytropis surculosa plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
