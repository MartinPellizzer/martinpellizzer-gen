    "intro": "Oncidium aberrans, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow and green flowers, which are typically arranged in a raceme. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in seasonal environments. Its roots are epiphytic, allowing it to grow on trees without being parasitic. Oncidium aberrans requires bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
