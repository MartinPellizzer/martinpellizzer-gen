    "intro": "Oreothamnus ramosus, commonly known as the Sierra broom, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, branched growth habit and small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Oreothamnus ramosus is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in mountainous regions. Its botanical features make it an important component of chaparral and woodland ecosystems."
