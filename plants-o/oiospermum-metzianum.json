    "intro": "Oiospermum metzianum, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of native New Zealand trees. It has small, leathery leaves and produces white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent. It plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for birds and insects. However, it can be harmful to its host tree if it becomes too dense."
