    "intro": "Orchis collina subsp. chlorotica, commonly known as the green-winged orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, showy spike of flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The flowers are usually violet or purple in color, with distinctive greenish markings on the petals and sepals. This subspecies is known for its preference for calcareous soils and open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its reproductive strategy involves mycorrhizal associations with fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake and enhance its survival in nutrient-poor environments."
