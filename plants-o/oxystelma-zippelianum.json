    "intro": "Oxystelma zippelianum, commonly known as the Zippel's oxystelma, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and requires a cool, moist environment to thrive. Its leaves are palmate, with five to seven lobes, and the flowers are usually pink or purple in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oxystelma zippelianum is considered a conservation concern."
