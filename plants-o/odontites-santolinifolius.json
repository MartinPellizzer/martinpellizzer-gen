    "intro": "Odontites santolinifolius, commonly known as the Santolinleaf toothplant, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other members of the carrot family, while its flowers are small and white. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
