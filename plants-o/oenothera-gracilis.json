    "intro": "Oenothera gracilis, commonly known as slender evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and yellow flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release the seeds, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in dry conditions. Oenothera gracilis is also notable for its ecological importance, providing nectar for nocturnal pollinators."
