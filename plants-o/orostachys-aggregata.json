    "intro": "Orostachys aggregata, commonly known as the clustered stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Asia. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, aiding in survival in dry environments. Its small, star-shaped flowers are typically white or pale pink, appearing in late spring or early summer. Orostachys aggregata is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
