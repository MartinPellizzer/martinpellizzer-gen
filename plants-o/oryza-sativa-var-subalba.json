    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. subalba, commonly known as the white rice variety, is a lesser-known subspecies of rice that exhibits distinct botanical characteristics. It is characterized by its pale, almost white grains, which set it apart from the more common brown or red rice varieties. This subspecies typically grows in temperate climates and has a shorter growth cycle compared to other rice types. The plant has slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. Its grains are often used in traditional culinary practices and have been studied for their potential nutritional and agricultural benefits."
