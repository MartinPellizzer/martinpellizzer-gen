    "intro": "Otiophora, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom once a year, making it a rare sight in the wild. Otiophora thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a conservation concern."
