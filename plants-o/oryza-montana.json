    "intro": "Oryza montana, commonly known as the mountain rice or wild rice, is a species of grass native to the Himalayas and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, mountainous regions and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. Oryza montana is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists and researchers due to its genetic diversity and potential for agricultural use."
