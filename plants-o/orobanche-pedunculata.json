    "intro": "Orobanche pedunculata, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its highly reduced, often yellow or reddish, flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically visited by specific pollinators, though it is mainly pollinated by insects. It is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species."
