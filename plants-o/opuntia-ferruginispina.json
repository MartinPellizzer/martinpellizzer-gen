    "intro": "Opuntia ferruginispina, commonly known as the iron spined prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and often used in local cuisines. Opuntia ferruginispina is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in desert ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife."
