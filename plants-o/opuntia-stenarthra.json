    "intro": "Opuntia stenarthra, commonly known as the narrow-armed prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in clusters of spines and glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia stenarthra is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, succulent stems. Its structure and growth habits make it a notable species within the Opuntiaceae family."
