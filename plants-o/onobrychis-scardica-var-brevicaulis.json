    "intro": "Onobrychis scardica var. brevicaulis, commonly known as the short-stemmed Scotch broom, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, erect stems that are often hairy, with small, bright yellow flowers arranged in dense racemes. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
