    "intro": "Oldenlandia pumila, commonly known as the small carpet grass or dwarf spiderwort, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wet meadows. The plant features slender, creeping stems that produce small, white or pale blue flowers with five petals. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs. Oldenlandia pumila is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed."
