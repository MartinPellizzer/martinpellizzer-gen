    "intro": "Oryza sativa communis, commonly known as rice, is a staple cereal grain in many parts of the world. It is an annual grass that typically grows in flooded fields, known as paddies, which provide the necessary conditions for its growth. The plant has long, slender leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that develop into grains. Its seeds, or grains, are rich in carbohydrates and are a primary food source for humans and animals. Oryza sativa communis is cultivated in a variety of climates and has been selectively bred for different grain types and traits over thousands of years."
