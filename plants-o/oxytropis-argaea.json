The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Oxytropis argaea is also known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment."
