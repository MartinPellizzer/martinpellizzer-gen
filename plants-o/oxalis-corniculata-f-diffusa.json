    "intro": "Oxalis corniculata f. diffusa, commonly known as the spreading wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to Asia and parts of Africa. It is a low-growing perennial with trifoliate leaves and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves and flowers are edible, though they contain oxalic acid, which can be harmful in large quantities. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to spread rapidly in suitable conditions."
