    "intro": "Odontosoria wrightiana, commonly known as Wright's tooth fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that resemble the shape of a tooth, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it thrives in humid and cool conditions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are protected by indusia, a feature common among ferns. Odontosoria wrightiana is of interest to botanists due to its primitive morphology and potential ecological significance in tropical ecosystems."
