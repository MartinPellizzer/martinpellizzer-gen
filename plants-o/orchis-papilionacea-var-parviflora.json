    "intro": "Orchis papilionacea var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered butterfly orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, butterfly-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces a single spike of flowers, each with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. This orchid is notable for its specialized relationship with certain fungal partners, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil."
