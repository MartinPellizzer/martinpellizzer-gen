    "intro": "Ononis tridentata f. edentula, commonly known as the toothed bedstraw, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Fabaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. This subspecies is notable for its reduced leaf teeth, distinguishing it from the typical form of Ononis tridentata."
