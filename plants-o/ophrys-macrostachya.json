    "intro": "Ophrys macrostachya, commonly known as the large-stalked bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in deception. Ophrys macrostachya is a perennial herb that produces a single, tall flowering stem with several showy blooms."
