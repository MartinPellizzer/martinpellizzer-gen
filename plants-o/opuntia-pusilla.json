    "intro": "Opuntia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf prickly pear, is a small cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rounded stems covered in soft, hair-like spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia pusilla is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, succulent stems. It plays an important role in desert ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
