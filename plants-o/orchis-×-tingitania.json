    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 tingitania, commonly known as the Gibraltar orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a perennial herb with a tall, upright stem that bears a single, showy spike of violet or purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and produces a distinctive, fragrant flower with a complex structure typical of orchids. It thrives in sunny, well-drained habitats and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
