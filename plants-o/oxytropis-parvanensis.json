    "intro": "Oxytropis parvanensis, commonly known as the small-flowered locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant is adapted to dry environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. Oxytropis parvanensis is also known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
