    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza rivularis, commonly known as the water fern, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or near streams. The plant is often epiphytic, growing on the surfaces of trees or rocks, and relies on atmospheric moisture for survival. Its reproductive structures include small, inconspicuous flowers that produce berries containing minute seeds. Ophiorrhiza rivularis plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
