    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 mirandana nothosubsp. coletteae, commonly known as the Colette's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its strikingly intricate flower structure, which mimics the appearance of female bees to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow, brown, and black, with a distinctive lip that resembles a bee's abdomen. This nothosubspecies is a result of natural hybridization between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera, showcasing the adaptive strategies of orchids in pollination."
