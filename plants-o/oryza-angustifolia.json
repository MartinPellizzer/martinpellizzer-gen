    "intro": "Oryza angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaf rice, is a species of grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and rice paddies. Its flowers are usually bisexual, with three stamens and a single pistil. Oryza angustifolia is closely related to other rice species and has been studied for its potential in agricultural and ecological contexts."
