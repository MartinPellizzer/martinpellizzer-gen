    "intro": "Ophelus sitularius, commonly known as the water pennywort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has small, opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of mucus. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white in color. Ophelus sitularius is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters and can sometimes indicate poor water quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
