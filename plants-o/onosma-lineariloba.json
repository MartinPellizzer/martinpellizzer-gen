    "intro": "Onosma lineariloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved onosma, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in temperate to alpine climates. It is often found in open habitats such as slopes and meadows, where it contributes to the floral diversity of its ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in its native range."
