    "intro": "Oberonia longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are highly fragrant, typically blooming during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Oberonia longifolia is considered a delicate and endangered species in its native range."
