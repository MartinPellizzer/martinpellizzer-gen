    "intro": "Opuntia \u00d7 alta, commonly known as the giant prickly pear, is a hybrid cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its succulent stems store water efficiently, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Opuntia \u00d7 alta is also notable for its role in traditional Native American medicine and as a source of food and forage."
