    "intro": "Ouratea scandens, commonly known as the climbing ouratea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or vine native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy beneath. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
