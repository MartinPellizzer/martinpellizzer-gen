It features small, yellow, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has elliptic to ovate leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation. Ochna fruticulosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun."
