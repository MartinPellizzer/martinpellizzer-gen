    "intro": "Onosma arenaria subsp. vaudensis, commonly known as the Vaud sand-rose, is a flowering plant native to the rocky and sandy soils of the Swiss Alps. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant blue to purple flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller, more densely packed leaves and shorter stems compared to the typical form of *Onosma arenaria*. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in high-altitude meadows. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
