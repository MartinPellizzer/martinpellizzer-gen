    "intro": "Ononis reclinata var. linnaei, commonly known as the Linnaean sand-verbena, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to the western United States. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous and well adapted to stabilize sandy soils. It is often found in coastal dunes and other dry, disturbed habitats."
