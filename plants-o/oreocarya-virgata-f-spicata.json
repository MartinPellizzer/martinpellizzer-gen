    "intro": "Oreocarya virgata f. spicata, commonly known as the spicate oreocarya, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, spicate flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in full sun. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens for its hardy nature and visual appeal."
