    "intro": "Odontosoria quadripinnata, commonly known as the four-pinnate water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its intricate frond structure, which features multiple pinnae and pinnules arranged in a highly subdivided pattern. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in wet forests. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
