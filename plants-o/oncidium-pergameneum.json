    "intro": "Oncidium pergameneum, commonly known as the Paper Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, thin pseudobulbs and linear, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with a distinctive white throat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Oncidium pergameneum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardeners."
