It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and areoles, which are specialized structures for producing flowers and branches. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible.

This variety is an important part of the local ecosystem, providing food and shelter for various native species."
