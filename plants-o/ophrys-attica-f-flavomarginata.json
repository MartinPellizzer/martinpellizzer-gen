    "intro": "Ophrys attica f. flavomarginata, commonly known as the Greek bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It is characterized by its intricate flower structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant features a single, erect stem with a few leaves and a single, showy flower that has a distinctive yellow margin. Its botanical significance lies in its unique pollination mechanism and its role in the biodiversity of its native habitat. This orchid is also of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and conservation status."
