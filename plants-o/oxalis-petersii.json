    "intro": "Oxalis petersii, commonly known as the Peters' wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves with distinct veins, resembling those of true sorrel species. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, typically in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its foliage and prolonged flowering period."
