    "intro": "Olyra flaccida, commonly known as the flaccid grassvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has slender, ascending stems covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom from late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are linear and slightly hairy, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Olyra flaccida is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is an important component of local ecosystems."
