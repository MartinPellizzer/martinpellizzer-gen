    "intro": "Ochna dekindtiana, commonly known as the De Kindt's ochna, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Ochnaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that are clustered in small umbels, followed by red or orange fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
