It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems covered in spiny areoles, which are specialized structures for producing flowers and branches. The plant produces large, showy yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are fleshy, edible berries that develop from the flowers and are often consumed by wildlife. This variety is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing typical succulent features for water storage and drought tolerance."
