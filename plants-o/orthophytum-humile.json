    "intro": "Orthophytum humile, commonly known as the small feather cactus, is a low-growing, stemless cactus native to southern Africa. It features a dense rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in a short inflorescence. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its succulent leaves. Orthophytum humile is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its compact size and attractive foliage."
