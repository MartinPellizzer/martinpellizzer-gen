    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 marinaltae, commonly known as the coastal bee orchid, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. This plant typically grows in coastal regions with sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Ophrys \u00d7 marinaltae is a rare and specialized species, often found in specific microhabitats along the Mediterranean coast."
