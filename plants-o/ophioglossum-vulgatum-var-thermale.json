    "intro": "Ophioglossum vulgatum var. thermale, commonly known as the thermophilic adder's tongue, is a rare fern species characterized by its unique morphology and habitat preferences. It possesses a distinctive, elongated, and often curved sporangium that is typically positioned at the base of the leaf. This variety thrives in warm, moist environments, often found in shaded, calcareous soils. Its sporophytes are usually short and stout, with a single, broad, lanceolate leaf. The plant's reproductive structures are specialized, with the sporangium containing spores that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution."
