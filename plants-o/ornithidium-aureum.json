    "intro": "Ornithidium aureum, commonly known as the golden feather fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, feathery fronds that display a striking golden hue, particularly under sunlight. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture to flourish. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, often hidden within the foliage. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Ornithidium aureum is considered a species of conservation concern."
