    "intro": "Ocotea mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican laurel, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves and fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of small, fleshy berries. Its bark and leaves have been traditionally used in folk medicine for their purported therapeutic properties. The tree is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture making."
