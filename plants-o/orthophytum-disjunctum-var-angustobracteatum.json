    "intro": "Orthophytum disjunctum var. angustobracteatum, commonly known as the narrow-bract orthophytum, is a compact, evergreen bromeliad native to Brazil. It features a rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
