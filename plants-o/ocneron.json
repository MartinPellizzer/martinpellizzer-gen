    "intro": "Ocneron, commonly known as the white spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested. The plant features simple, alternate leaves and produces small, clustered yellow flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Ocneron is often used in traditional medicine, though its use requires caution due to its potentially harmful properties."
