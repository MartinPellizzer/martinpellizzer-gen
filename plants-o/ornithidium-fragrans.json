    "intro": "Ornithidium fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant bird's nest fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, clustered fronds that resemble a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and landscape design."
