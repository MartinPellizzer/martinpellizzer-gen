    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia f. levaschevoica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its distinctive, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. This orchid is typically found in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or meadow habitats. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and exhibits a complex relationship with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
