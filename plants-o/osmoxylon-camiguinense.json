    "intro": "Osmoxylon camiguinense, commonly known as the Camiguin wood or Camiguin tree, is a rare tropical tree species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its thick, aromatic bark that contains valuable essential oils. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape, while its flowers are small and clustered in spikes. Due to habitat loss, Osmoxylon camiguinense is considered endangered and is of significant ecological and scientific interest."
