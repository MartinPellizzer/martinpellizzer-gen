    "intro": "Oxytropis pannosa, commonly known as the pannonian milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to Central Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Oxytropis pannosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
