    "intro": "Ornithogalum narbonense subsp. brevistylum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved star-of-Bethlehem, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of star-shaped, white flowers with a greenish tinge. The plant is adapted to rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. It is often found in Mediterranean climates and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
