    "intro": "Ophrys rhodia, commonly known as the Rhodian bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow, brown, and green, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Ophrys rhodia is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, often blooming in late spring to early summer."
