    "intro": "Opuntia weberi, commonly known as the Weber's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in sharp spines and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces edible fruits known as tunas, which are typically harvested in the summer months. Opuntia weberi is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its structure and growth habits make it a distinctive and resilient member of the Cactaceae family."
