    "intro": "Octomeris polyandra, commonly known as the tropical milkweed, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking orange to red flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings. Octomeris polyandra is also a popular choice for gardeners due to its ability to attract butterflies and other pollinators."
