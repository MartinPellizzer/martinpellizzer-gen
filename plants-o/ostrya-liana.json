It belongs to the Tutsan family (Tutsanaceae) and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, followed by small, winged fruits. Ostrya liana thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and botanical gardens."
