    "intro": "Orthochilus monticola, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricately shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from poor soil, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
