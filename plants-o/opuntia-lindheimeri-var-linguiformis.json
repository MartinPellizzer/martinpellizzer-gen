    "intro": "Opuntia lindheimeri var. linguiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are typically narrow and ribbed, with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are modified into spiny structures called cladodes, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is well adapted to hot, dry climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
