It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, waxy leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring. The plant is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its showy, composite flower heads. Opulaster capitatus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
