    "intro": "Octadesmia montana, commonly known as the mountain octadesmia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its cool, humid habitat. Octadesmia montana produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators like bees and flies."
