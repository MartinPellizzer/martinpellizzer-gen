    "intro": "Ottoschmidtia microphylla subsp. haitiensis, commonly known as the Haitian dwarf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Haiti. It has small, leathery leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length, adapted for efficient water retention in its tropical environment. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects, and its berries are consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It grows primarily on the branches of host trees, such as those in the Moraceae family, and forms dense clusters that can affect the host's growth. Its botanical features reflect its ecological role as both a parasite and a contributor to forest biodiversity."
