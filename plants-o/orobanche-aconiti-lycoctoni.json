    "intro": "Orobanche aconiti-lycoctoni, commonly known as the great yellow witchweed, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers, often in clusters, and has a short, stout stem with few leaves. It is considered a hemiparasite, meaning it can photosynthesize to a limited extent but primarily depends on its host for sustenance. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
