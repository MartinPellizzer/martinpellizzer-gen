    "intro": "Oberonia bilobata, commonly known as the two-lobed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, clumping growth habit and possesses pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, often with a distinctive two-lobed lip. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining potting media. Oberonia bilobata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in terrariums or as a houseplant."
