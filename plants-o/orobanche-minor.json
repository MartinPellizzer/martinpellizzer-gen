    "intro": "Orobanche minor, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, slender stem with no true leaves. It typically parasitizes crops such as wheat, barley, and legumes, making it a significant agricultural pest. Due to its lack of photosynthesis, it plays a unique role in ecological systems as a specialist parasite."
