    "intro": "Orobanche pancicii f. kerochroa, commonly known as the pale orobanche, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically parasitizing members of the legume family. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pale pink or white in color. Its morphology is characterized by a short, fleshy stem and reduced leaves. This subspecies is notable for its specialized adaptations to parasitic growth and its limited geographic distribution."
