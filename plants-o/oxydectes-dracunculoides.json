    "intro": "Oxydectes dracunculoides, commonly known as the dragon's blood tree, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown and thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. Its sap, which is highly viscous and red in color, has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a dye. The species is also notable for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its unique adaptations to survive in dry conditions."
