    "intro": "Opsicarpium insignis, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in natural habitats."
