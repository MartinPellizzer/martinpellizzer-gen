    "intro": "Opuntia stipata, commonly known as the stippled prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems that are covered in spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Opuntia stipata is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its structure and growth patterns make it a notable species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
