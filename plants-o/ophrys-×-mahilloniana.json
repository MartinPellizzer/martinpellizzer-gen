    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 mahilloniana, commonly known as the Mahillon's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-shaped flower that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe and North Africa. Its flowers are usually yellowish-brown with dark markings, and it produces small, greenish-black fruits. Ophrys \u00d7 mahilloniana is valued for its unique morphology and ecological role in pollination networks."
