    "intro": "Orobus tuberosus var. albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered tuberous orobus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its tuberous roots, which store nutrients and allow it to survive in harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces clusters of showy, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and traditional medicinal uses."
