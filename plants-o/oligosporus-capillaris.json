    "intro": "Oligosporus capillaris, commonly known as the slender spore grass, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces lightweight, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its wide distribution. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Oligosporus capillaris is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open fields."
