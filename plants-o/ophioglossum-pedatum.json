    "intro": "Ophioglossum pedatum, commonly known as the spurred adder's mouth, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into two parts, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces sporangia in specialized structures called sporangial cushions, which are located on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in temperate regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophioglossum pedatum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
