    "intro": "Opuntia lucens, commonly known as the luminous prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and are often ribbed. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which bloom in the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. Opuntia lucens is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and reducing water loss through its waxy surface."
