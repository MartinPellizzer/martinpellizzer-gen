    "intro": "Oncidium cuculligerum, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, arching stems and clusters of fragrant, yellow-green flowers with a distinctive hood-like structure on the petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. Oncidium cuculligerum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
