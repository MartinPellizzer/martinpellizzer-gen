    "intro": "Opuntia procumbens, commonly known as the low prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling stems that are covered in small, spine-tipped pads. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia procumbens is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It plays an important role in local ecosystems and is also valued for its ornamental and edible qualities."
