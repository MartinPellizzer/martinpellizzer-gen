    "intro": "Oreocarya dura, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble dandelion blooms. The plant has a rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer, producing small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Oreocarya dura is adapted to harsh, sunny conditions and is often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes."
