It features dense, silver-gray foliage that is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive, almost velvety appearance. The plant produces small, daisy-like white flowers with yellow centers, which bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in temperate climates."
