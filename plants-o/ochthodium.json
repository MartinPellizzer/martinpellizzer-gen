    "intro": "Ochthodium, commonly known as the \"glasswort,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Plumbaginaceae. These plants are characterized by their succulent, often fleshy leaves and showy, blue or purple flowers. They are typically found in coastal areas and saline soils, demonstrating a high tolerance for salt and drought. Ochthodium species are often used in xeriscaping due to their low water requirements and ornamental value. Their unique adaptations make them important components of coastal ecosystems."
