    "intro": "Oxytropis montana proles jacquinii, commonly known as the mountain milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its erect stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life. Additionally, it is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in arid conditions."
