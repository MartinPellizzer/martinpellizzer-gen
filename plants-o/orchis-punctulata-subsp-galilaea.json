    "intro": "Orchis punctulata subsp. galilaea, commonly known as the Galilaea orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, pubescent layer. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with distinctive purple spots, which are clustered in a loose raceme. It thrives in rocky or calcareous soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
