    "intro": "Octarrhena exigua, commonly known as the small-leaved sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of less than 30 centimeters. The plant has narrow, fleshy leaves that are adapted to conserve water, and it produces small, pale yellow flowers during the cooler months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland dune environments. Due to its resilience and hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control in dry climates."
