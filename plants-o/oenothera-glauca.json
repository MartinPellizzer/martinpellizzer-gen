    "intro": "Oenothera glauca, commonly known as prairie smoke, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its unique, silvery-blue flower heads that resemble smoke, which are actually composed of many tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. It has a taproot system and produces a showy display of pale pink to blue flowers in late spring to early summer. Oenothera glauca is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its historical use by Indigenous peoples for medicinal purposes."
