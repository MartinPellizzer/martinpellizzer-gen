    "intro": "Ophrys liliifolia, commonly known as the Lily Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a complex, butterfly-like lip that plays a crucial role in pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or woodland habitats, preferring well-drained soils and partial shade. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are adorned with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of female insects, aiding in its specialized pollination strategy. Ophrys liliifolia is a protected species due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss."
