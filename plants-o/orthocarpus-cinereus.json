    "intro": "Orthocarpus cinereus, commonly known as the silverleaf orthocarpus, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are finely divided and covered in a silvery, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Orthocarpus cinereus is often found in coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
