    "intro": "Oxalis valdiviana, commonly known as the Chilean wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are often covered in small, bead-like structures called stipules, which are a distinctive botanical feature. Oxalis valdiviana is also known for its ability to thrive in cool climates and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
