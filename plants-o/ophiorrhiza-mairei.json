It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries like India, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The plant typically grows on the branches of host trees, relying on them for water and some nutrients while conducting photosynthesis. Its small, leathery leaves are usually clustered at the base of the stems, and it produces small, white or yellowish flowers. Ophiorrhiza mairei plays a role in ecological interactions, supporting various insect pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
