    "intro": "Orchiastrum romanzoffianum, commonly known as the Romanzoff's orchid, is a rare and exotic flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its intricate, showy flowers with a complex structure typical of orchids. The plant produces delicate, fragrant blooms in shades of purple and white, often with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
