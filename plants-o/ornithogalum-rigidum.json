    "intro": "Ornithogalum rigidum, commonly known as the rigid star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick rhizome and produces tall, straight stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant blooms with clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that resemble small bells, typically in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Ornithogalum rigidum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
