    "intro": "Ophrys igiliae, commonly known as the Sicilian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the island of Sicily. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a pouch-like lip that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophrys igiliae is considered a vulnerable species."
