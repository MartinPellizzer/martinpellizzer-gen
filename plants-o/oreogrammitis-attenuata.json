    "intro": "Oreogrammitis attenuata, commonly known as the slender wall fern, is a species of fern native to various parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, making it a common epiphyte or lithophyte. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a slightly curled appearance, contributing to its ornamental value. Oreogrammitis attenuata is valued in horticulture for its ability to thrive in humid conditions and its elegant, foliage structure."
