    "intro": "Oenothera albicaulis var. tigrina, commonly known as the tiger milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the central and western United States. It is characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, often with a yellowish tinge at the base. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces elongated seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. The species is notable for its ecological importance, providing nectar for various pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
