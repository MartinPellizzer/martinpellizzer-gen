    "intro": "Oberonia finisterrae, commonly known as the Canary Islands orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the Canary Islands. It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact, cushion-like growth habit, typically growing in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip that is often adorned with intricate patterns. Its botanical characteristics reflect adaptations to the unique microclimates of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
