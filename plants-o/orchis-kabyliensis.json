    "intro": "Orchis kabyliensis, commonly known as the Kabylian orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Algeria and parts of southern Italy. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny environments. Its flowers are often visited by various pollinators, including bees and moths, contributing to its ecological significance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
