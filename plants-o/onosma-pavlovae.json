    "intro": "Onosma pavlovae, commonly known as Pavlov's honewort, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, adapted to thrive in dry, rocky environments. It is often found in steppes and semi-deserts, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
