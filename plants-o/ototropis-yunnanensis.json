    "intro": "Ototropis yunnanensis, commonly known as Yunnan Ototropis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, commonly known as the carrot or parsley family, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
