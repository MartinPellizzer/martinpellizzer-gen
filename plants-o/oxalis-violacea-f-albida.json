It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is native to regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are often pink or white, adding to its ornamental appeal. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its unique aesthetic qualities in shaded garden settings."
