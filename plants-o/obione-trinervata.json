    "intro": "Obione trinervata, commonly known as the three-veined fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. The plant features a slender, upright rhizome with pinnately compound leaves that have three distinct veins. Its reproductive structures include spore-bearing clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Obione trinervata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in horticultural collections."
