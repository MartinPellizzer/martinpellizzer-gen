    "intro": "Orchis incarnata subsp. durandii, commonly known as the pink fairy orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. The plant produces striking pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, with a distinctive spurred lip that is characteristic of the Orchidaceae family. Its morphology includes a basal rosette of leaves and a single flowering stem that bears several showy flowers. The subspecies durandii is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and slightly different floral coloration compared to the typical form of Orchis incarnata."
