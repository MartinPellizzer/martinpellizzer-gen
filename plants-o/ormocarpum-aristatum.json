    "intro": "Ormocarpum aristatum, commonly known as the spiked ormocarp, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a rough, hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. The fruit is a dry, two-lobed capsule that splits open to release the seeds."
