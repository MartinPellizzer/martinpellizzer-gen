    "intro": "Olearia uniflora, commonly known as the silver felt tree, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-white foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost frost-covered appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in compact inflorescences. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas. Olearia uniflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
