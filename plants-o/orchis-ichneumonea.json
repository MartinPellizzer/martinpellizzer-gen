    "intro": "Orchis ichneumonea, commonly known as the mouse-ear orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along riverbanks. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces a tall, unbranched stem with a single spike of pale pink to white flowers. Its flowers have a distinctive lip that is broader than the other petals, a characteristic feature of the Orchidaceae family. The plant is also known for its association with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which play a crucial role in its growth and reproduction."
