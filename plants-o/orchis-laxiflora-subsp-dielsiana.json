    "intro": "Orchis laxiflora subsp. dielsiana, commonly known as the Diels' looseflower orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowers are spurred at the base, a typical feature of many orchid species, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. The subspecies dielsiana is distinguished by its slightly different flower morphology and habitat preferences compared to the main species."
