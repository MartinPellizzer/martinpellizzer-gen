    "intro": "Oberonia makinoi, commonly known as the Makino's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its compact appearance. Oberonia makinoi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
