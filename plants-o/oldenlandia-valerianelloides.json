    "intro": "Oldenlandia valerianelloides, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false jessamine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that contain numerous tiny seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields due to its adaptability and rapid growth."
