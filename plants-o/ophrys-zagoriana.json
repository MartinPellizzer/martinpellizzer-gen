    "intro": "Ophrys zagoriana, commonly known as the Zagora bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Ophrys zagoriana is a rare and endangered species, requiring specific environmental conditions for successful growth and reproduction."
