    "intro": "Ophiopogon spicatus var. communis, commonly known as the Japanese forest grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense, low-growing clumps, often carpeting the forest floor. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers in dense spikes during the spring and early summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in temperate forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in shaded areas."
