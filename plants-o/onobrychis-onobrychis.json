It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides. It has a deep taproot system that allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
