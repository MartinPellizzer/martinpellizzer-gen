    "intro": "Onobrychis melanotricha var. ecbatanaica, commonly known as the Ecbatana burr clover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces distinctive burr-like pods that enclose the seeds, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
