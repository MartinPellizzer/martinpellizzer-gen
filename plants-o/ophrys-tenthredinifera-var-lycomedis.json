    "intro": "Ophrys tenthredinifera var. lycomedis, commonly known as the Lycomedis bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, which closely resembles a female bee, a trait evolved to facilitate pollination by male bees through mimicry. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
