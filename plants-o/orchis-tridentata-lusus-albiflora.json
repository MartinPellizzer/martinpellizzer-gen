    "intro": "Orchis tridentata lusus albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered twayblade, is a rare orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with a single, white or pale yellow flower. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and heathlands. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many areas."
