    "intro": "Oreopanax angularis, commonly known as the angular oreopanax, is a member of the Araliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of forests. The plant features compound leaves with a distinctive angular shape, which gives it its common name. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in umbellate inflorescences, and it produces berries that are edible for some bird species. Oreopanax angularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
