    "intro": "Odontoptera, commonly known as the orchid mantis, is a striking example of mimicry in the plant-animal interface. While not a true plant, it is often mistaken for a flower due to its intricate, petal-like appendages. The plant-like appearance serves as a defense mechanism against predators. Its body is covered in fine, translucent wings that resemble delicate petals. This mimicry allows it to blend seamlessly with its environment, enhancing its survival in tropical habitats."
