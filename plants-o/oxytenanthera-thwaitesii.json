    "intro": "Oxytenanthera thwaitesii, commonly known as the silky oaks, is a tropical tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikes, which are followed by woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its shade-providing canopy."
