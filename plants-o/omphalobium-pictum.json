    "intro": "Omphalobium pictum, commonly known as the painted grass vetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Australia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of yellow and white. Its leaves are alternate and pinnately divided, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. Omphalobium pictum is often found in coastal regions and is adapted to tolerate saline and nutrient-poor soils."
