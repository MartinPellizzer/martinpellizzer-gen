    "intro": "Orthochilus euanthus, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant features showy, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a subtle fragrance. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil of its habitat. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
