    "intro": "Oligoneuron houghtonii, commonly known as Houghton's oligoneuron, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
