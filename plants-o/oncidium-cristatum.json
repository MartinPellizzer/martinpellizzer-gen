    "intro": "Oncidium cristatum, commonly known as the Christmas orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its branched inflorescence, which gives it its scientific name \"cristatum,\" meaning \"crested.\" The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often blooming during the holiday season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Oncidium cristatum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ease of care and long-lasting blooms."
