    "intro": "Oryza sativa proles indica, commonly known as indica rice, is a subspecies of rice native to South and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender grains, shorter plant stature, and lower yield compared to other rice types. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical climates, requiring ample water and warm temperatures for optimal growth. Its genetic diversity contributes to a wide range of varieties with varying traits such as grain size and aroma. Indica rice is widely cultivated for its adaptability and is a staple food in many Asian countries."
