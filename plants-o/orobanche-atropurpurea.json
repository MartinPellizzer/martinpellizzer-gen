    "intro": "Orobanche atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its dense, purple to reddish stems and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in association with legumes and other broad-leaved plants. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by its host, and it can significantly reduce the growth and yield of agricultural crops. Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a weed in many regions where it infests cultivated plants."
