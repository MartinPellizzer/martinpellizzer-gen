    "intro": "Operculina aurea, commonly known as the golden bell vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that resemble small bells, which bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. It produces a unique fruit that is initially covered by a cap-like structure, which falls off as the fruit matures. Operculina aurea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
