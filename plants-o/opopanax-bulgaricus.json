    "intro": "Opopanax bulgaricus, commonly known as Bulgarian frankincense, is a rare and ancient plant native to the Balkan region. It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic resinous sap, which has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, thriving in regions with limited rainfall. Its unique chemical composition includes compounds like \u03b1-pinene and \u03b2-caryophyllene, contributing to its medicinal properties. Due to its scarcity and habitat specificity, Opopanax bulgaricus is considered a valuable and endangered species."
