    "intro": "Olax tsaratananensis, commonly known as the Tsaratanana olax, is an endemic species native to the eastern rainforests of Madagascar. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of about 3 meters. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in terminal inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and threatened species."
