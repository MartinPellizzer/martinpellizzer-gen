    "intro": "Ourisia rupicola, commonly known as the rock everlasting, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features small, evergreen leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. Its flowers are usually yellow or pale green, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer. Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
