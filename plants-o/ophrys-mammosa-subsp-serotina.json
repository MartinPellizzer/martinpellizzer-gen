    "intro": "Ophrys mammosa subsp. serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive, swollen labellum that resembles a bee's abdomen. It typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its blooming period occurs later in the season compared to other Ophrys species, hence its common name."
