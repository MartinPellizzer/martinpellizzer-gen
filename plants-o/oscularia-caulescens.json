The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often opening in the morning. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family, which includes many climbing and trailing plants. Oscularia caulescens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and blooms."
