    "intro": "Ophelia japonica f. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal spikerush, is a perennial wetland plant native to coastal regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that grow in dense clusters, often in shallow water or moist soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, arranged in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in brackish or freshwater environments and is often found along shorelines and in marshy areas. Ophelia japonica f. littoralis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
