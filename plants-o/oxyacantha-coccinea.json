    "intro": "Oxyacantha coccinea, commonly known as the red-fruited bush or red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, showy pink to red flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible when ripe but contain toxic seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a serrated margin. Oxyacantha coccinea thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
