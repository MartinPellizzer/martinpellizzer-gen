    "intro": "Otoglossum arevaloi, commonly known as the Arevalo's orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, specifically in Ecuador and Peru. The plant features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its blooms typically appear in the spring and are characterized by their intricate, lip-like petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Otoglossum arevaloi is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
