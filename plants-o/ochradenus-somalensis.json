    "intro": "Ochradenus somalensis, commonly known as the Somali spurge, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Somalia and neighboring areas. It is characterized by its succulent, often hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically arranged in umbels, and it is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It has a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. Ochradenus somalensis is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
