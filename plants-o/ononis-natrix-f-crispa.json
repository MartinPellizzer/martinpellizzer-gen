    "intro": "Ononis natrix f. crispa, commonly known as the curly knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems that often curl and twist, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. This variety is a variation of the common knotweed, distinguished by its more pronounced curling growth habit."
