    "intro": "Orobanche teucrionepiphyta, commonly known as the European dwarf broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. This species typically parasitizes plants from the Fabaceae family, such as vetches and clovers. Its life cycle involves producing seeds that remain dormant in the soil for years until a suitable host emerges. Due to its specialized parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in certain ecosystems, though it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
