    "intro": "Opercularia liberiflora, commonly known as the cloud-veiled orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, pale green leaves and unique, translucent flowers that resemble delicate veils. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates in mountainous areas. Its flowers bloom during the spring and early summer, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited habitat and threats from habitat destruction, Opercularia liberiflora is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
