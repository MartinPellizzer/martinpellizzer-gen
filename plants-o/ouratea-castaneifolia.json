    "intro": "Ouratea castaneifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian wax tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and its striking, palmately lobed leaves that resemble the shape of a chestnut. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, chestnut-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
