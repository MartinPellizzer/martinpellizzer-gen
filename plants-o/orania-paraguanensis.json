    "intro": "Orania paraguanensis, commonly known as the Paraguanense orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically display a combination of vibrant colors, including shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the forest floor, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for successful germination. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Orania paraguanensis is considered a vulnerable species."
