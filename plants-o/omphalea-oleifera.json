    "intro": "Omphalea oleifera, commonly known as the African butter tree, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Africa and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its palm-like appearance, with thick, waxy leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant is notable for producing a milky latex sap, which has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties. Its fruits are small, green berries that turn red when ripe, containing seeds enclosed in a fleshy pulp. Omphalea oleifera is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the latex it produces, which has applications in traditional medicine and industry."
