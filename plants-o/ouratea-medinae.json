    "intro": "Ouratea medinae, commonly known as the Medina ouratea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and small, opposite leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, and it produces small, red berries that are edible for some animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
