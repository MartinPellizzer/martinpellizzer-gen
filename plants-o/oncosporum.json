    "intro": "Oncosporum, commonly known as the common spurge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. These plants are characterized by their milky sap, which is often toxic and can cause skin irritation. Oncosporum species typically have simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia. They are often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine or as ornamental plants."
