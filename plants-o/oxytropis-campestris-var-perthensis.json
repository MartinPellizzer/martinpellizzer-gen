    "intro": "Oxytropis campestris var. perthensis, commonly known as the Perth burr or burr vetch, is a perennial legume native to the south-western regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its erect, spindly stems and clusters of small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces distinctive, hooked burrs that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and disturbed areas. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in some regions."
