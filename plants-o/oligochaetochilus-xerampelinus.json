    "intro": "Oligochaetochilus xerampelinus, commonly known as the Xerampelina orchid, is a terrestrial orchid belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant typically features a short, rhizomatous stem with a few leaves and produces small, showy flowers in shades of white and pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, humus-rich soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
