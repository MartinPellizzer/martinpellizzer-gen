    "intro": "Ononis natrix var. pinguis, commonly known as the fat bladderweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, hairy pods. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
