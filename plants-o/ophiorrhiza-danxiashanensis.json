    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza danxiashanensis, commonly known as Danxiashan's sandalwood, is a rare shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and panicle-like inflorescence. The plant produces small white flowers followed by dark blue berries, which are adapted for dispersal by birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
