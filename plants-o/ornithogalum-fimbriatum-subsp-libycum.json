    "intro": "Ornithogalum fimbriatum subsp. libycum, commonly known as the Libyan star-of-Bethleem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa. It features narrow, linear leaves and produces umbels of white or pale yellow flowers with a star-like appearance. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with a fibrous root system that helps it survive in poor soils. It is often found in rocky or sandy habitats and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter, more compact growth compared to other subspecies of *Ornithogalum fimbriatum*."
