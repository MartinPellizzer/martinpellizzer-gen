    "intro": "Oxytropis foucaudii, commonly known as the Foucaud's locoweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in mountainous or coastal areas. The plant produces small, spiny stems and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are usually compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. Oxytropis foucaudii is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it access water from deeper soil layers."
