    "intro": "Oxypetalum oblanceolatum, commonly known as the white-flowered oxypetalum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in countries like Colombia and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its showy, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped and have a leathery texture, while its stems are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. Oxypetalum oblanceolatum is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
