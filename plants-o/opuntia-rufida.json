    "intro": "Opuntia rufida, commonly known as the red prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are typically green with a reddish tinge, especially in full sun. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red-orange fruits known as tunas. Its spiny stems and leaves are adapted to thrive in arid environments, storing water and minimizing water loss. Opuntia rufida is also known for its ability to propagate through offsets, making it a resilient and widely distributed species."
