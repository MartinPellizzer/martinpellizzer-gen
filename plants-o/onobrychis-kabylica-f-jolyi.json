    "intro": "Onobrychis kabylica f. jolyi, commonly known as the Joly's vetch, is a rare and lesser-known legume native to the Balkan region. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to poor soil conditions. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
