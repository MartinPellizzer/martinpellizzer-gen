    "intro": "Oncidium ornithorhynchum, commonly known as the bird-beak orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its unique, elongated flowers that resemble a bird's beak, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its inflorescence consists of a single, racemose spike bearing several showy, fragrant flowers. Oncidium ornithorhynchum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
