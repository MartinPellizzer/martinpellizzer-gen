It features a bulbous stem that produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant blooms with umbel-like inflorescences of white or pale green flowers, which are often fragrant. Its leaves and bulbs contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or open habitats."
