    "intro": "Ophrys umbilicata subsp. latakiana, commonly known as the Latakian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across the Balkans. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive pouch-shaped labellum and a complex arrangement of sepals and petals. It thrives in open, sunny areas with well-drained soil, often in mountainous or rocky regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to protect its population."
