    "intro": "Ornithoglossum glaucum var. grandiflorum, commonly known as the blue-flowered lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Paracryphiaceae and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a hairy surface, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly in suitable habitats. It prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas or along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
