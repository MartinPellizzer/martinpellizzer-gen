    "intro": "Orobanche antirrhina, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various parts of Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a taproot system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to parasitize crops like wheat and barley. Its life cycle involves germination triggered by chemical signals from host plants, making it a challenging species to manage."
