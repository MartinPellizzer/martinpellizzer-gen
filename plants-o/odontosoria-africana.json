    "intro": "Odontosoria africana, commonly known as the African tooth fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that resemble a toothbrush. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories across sub-Saharan Africa. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to the soil. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a consistent appearance throughout the year."
