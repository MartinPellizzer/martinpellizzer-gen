    "intro": "Oriastrum abbreviatum, commonly known as the shortleaf globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as gravelly soils and limestone areas. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, yellowish-orange flowers with a distinctive globular shape. Its botanical characteristics include a woody stem and small, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Oriastrum abbreviatum is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
