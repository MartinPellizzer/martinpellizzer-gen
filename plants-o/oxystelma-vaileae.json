    "intro": "Oxystelma vaileae, commonly known as the Vaile's oxystelma, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal habitats and is adapted to the island's unique climate and soil conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this rare and endemic flora."
