    "intro": "Otholobium trianthum, commonly known as the three-flowered bushveld clover, is a perennial legume native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features small, trifoliate leaves and produces clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Otholobium trianthum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its habitat."
