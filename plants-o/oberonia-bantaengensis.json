    "intro": "Oberonia bantaengensis, commonly known as the Bantaeng orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the tropical rainforests of Indonesia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to conserve moisture in the humid environment. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Oberonia bantaengensis is considered a threatened species."
