    "intro": "Oxytropis aciphylla var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender leaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its distinctive, narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Oxytropis aciphylla var. gracilis is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which can improve soil fertility in dry environments."
