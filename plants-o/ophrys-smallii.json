    "intro": "Ophrys smallii, commonly known as the small orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is a terrestrial herb with a compact growth habit, featuring a single, leafless stem that bears a single flower. The flower has a distinctive pouch-like structure, known as a labellum, which is often mimicking the appearance of an insect to aid in pollination. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in several countries."
