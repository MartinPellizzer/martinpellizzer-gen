    "intro": "Olearia pallida, commonly known as the silverweed tree, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, soft, woolly hairs covering the leaves and stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Olearia pallida is often found in coastal and subalpine regions, thriving in well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting native wildlife."
