    "intro": "Othonna pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf othonna, is a small, succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features compact, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Othonna pygmaea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
