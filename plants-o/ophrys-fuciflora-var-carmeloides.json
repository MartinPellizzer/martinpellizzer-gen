    "intro": "Ophrys fuciflora var. carmeloides, commonly known as the Carmel orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to California. It is characterized by its distinctive, mottled green and brown leaves that resemble bark, providing it with camouflage in its natural habitat. The plant produces a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a complex structure that mimics the appearance of an insect, aiding in pollination. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal areas and chaparral habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
