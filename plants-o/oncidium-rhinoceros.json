    "intro": "Oncidium rhinoceros, commonly known as the rhinoceros orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting flowers that come in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in conditions with seasonal dry periods. Oncidium rhinoceros is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
