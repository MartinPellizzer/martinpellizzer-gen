It is native to tropical regions of the Americas and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic weed in some regions."
