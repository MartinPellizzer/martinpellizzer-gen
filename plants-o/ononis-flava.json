    "intro": "Ononis flava, commonly known as yellow sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate touch to its environment. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Ononis flava is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
