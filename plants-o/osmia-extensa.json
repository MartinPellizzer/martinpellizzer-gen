    "intro": "Osmia extensa, commonly known as the southern masked bee, is a solitary ground-nesting bee species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive black and yellow body with a metallic sheen, and its females have a unique facial pattern that resembles a mask. The plant associations of Osmia extensa are primarily with flowering plants that provide nectar and pollen, particularly those in the Asteraceae and Fabaceae families. It plays a crucial role in pollination, contributing to the reproductive success of various wild and cultivated plants. Due to habitat loss and pesticide use, this species is considered vulnerable in some regions."
