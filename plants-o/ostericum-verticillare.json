    "intro": "Ostericum verticillare, commonly known as the clustered wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It features small, dark green, elliptical leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, fragrant white flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its aromatic leaves contain compounds that release a strong wintergreen scent when crushed. Ostericum verticillare is often found in moist, acidic soils in boreal and subarctic environments."
