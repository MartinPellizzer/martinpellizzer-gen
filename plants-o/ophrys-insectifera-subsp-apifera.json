    "intro": "Ophrys insectifera subsp. apifera, commonly known as the honey bee orchid, is a specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait known as pseudocopulation, which aids in pollination by male bees. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with a distinctive yellow and brown coloration, often with a dark spot resembling an eye. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The subspecies apifera is distinguished by its more robust floral morphology compared to other subspecies of Ophrys insectifera."
