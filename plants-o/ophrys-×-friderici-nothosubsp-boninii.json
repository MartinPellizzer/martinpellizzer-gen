    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 friderici nothosubsp. boninii, commonly known as the Bonin bee orchid, is a rare hybrid orchid native to the Bonin Islands. It belongs to the genus Ophrys, which is known for its intricate floral mimicry, often resembling female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
