    "intro": "Opuntia tomentosa var. spraguei, commonly known as the Sprague's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments. The plant is also noted for its spines, which provide protection from herbivores."
