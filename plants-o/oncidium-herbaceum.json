    "intro": "Oncidium herbaceum, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a herbaceous perennial with a rhizomatous growth habit, featuring a compact, bushy appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, green, and white, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are strap-like, narrow, and often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Oncidium herbaceum is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its compact size and relatively low maintenance requirements."
