    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 scalana, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant that results from the cross between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid). It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe, particularly in regions like Spain and Italy. The plant is characterized by its unique, orchid-like flowers that mimic the appearance of female bees or wasps, a trait known as pseudocopulation, which aids in pollination. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of flowers, each with a specialized labellum that plays a key role in attracting pollinators. The hybrid is known for its genetic variability and is often found in calcareous soils, thriving in open, sunny habitats."
