    "intro": "Onagra erosa, commonly known as evening primrose, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It features slender, branching stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that open in the late afternoon, hence its common name. Its seeds are encased in a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant is known for its high content of gamma-linolenic acid, making it valuable in both traditional and modern medicinal applications."
