    "intro": "Oncidium falcicorne, commonly known as the sword orchid, is a tropical orchid species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its sword-shaped leaves and pendulous, racemose inflorescences that bear fragrant, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are often yellow or orange with dark markings, and they bloom sequentially along the spike. Oncidium falcicorne is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
