It features trifoliate leaves with small, serrated leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers in racemes. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. It is often used for soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable in ecological restoration projects."
