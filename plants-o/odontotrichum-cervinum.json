    "intro": "Odontotrichum cervinum, commonly known as the golden hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with fine, silver-green leaves that have a soft, hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, yellowish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Odontotrichum cervinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting insect populations."
