    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. desvauxii, commonly known as the dwarf rice variety, is a botanical variant of rice characterized by its compact growth habit and reduced plant height. It is native to Southeast Asia and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered panicles of rice grains. Its genome has been studied for its potential in developing disease-resistant and high-yield rice cultivars. This variety is of interest in agricultural research due to its genetic diversity and adaptability."
