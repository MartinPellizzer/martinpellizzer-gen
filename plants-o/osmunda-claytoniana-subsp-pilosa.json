    "intro": "Osmunda claytoniana subsp. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy royal fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds and spore-producing structures. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in humid conditions. The plant features a tall, unbranched sterile frond that is covered in soft, hairy structures, giving it its common name. Its fertile fronds are shorter and bear clusters of spore cases, which are essential for reproduction. The botanical structure of Osmunda claytoniana subsp. pilosa reflects its adaptation to wetland habitats and its role in ecological systems."
