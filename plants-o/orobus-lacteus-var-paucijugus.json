    "intro": "Orobus lacteus var. paucijugus, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in soil enrichment and restoration efforts."
