It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and rushes, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and along riverbanks. It produces small, clustered inflorescences with spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of ecological study."
