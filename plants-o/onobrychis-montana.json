    "intro": "Onobrychis montana, commonly known as mountain vetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features slender, trailing stems with small, compound leaves and produces yellowish-white flowers in clusters. Its seeds are encased in a distinctive, hairy pod, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobial bacteria. Onobrychis montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
