    "intro": "Oxypappus gracilis, commonly known as slender oxypappus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typical sunflower-like structure. The plant is typically found in open, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, pale yellow to white flowers bloom in summer, and it produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Oxypappus gracilis is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in disturbed areas."
