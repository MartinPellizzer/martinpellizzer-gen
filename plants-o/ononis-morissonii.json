    "intro": "Ononis morissonii, commonly known as Morrison's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid and coastal habitat. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the coastline. Ononis morissonii is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing dune environments."
