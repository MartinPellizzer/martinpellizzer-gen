    "intro": "Onosma microcarpa var. stapfii, commonly known as the Stapf's dwarf wallflower, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or gravelly garden settings. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry, hot climates."
