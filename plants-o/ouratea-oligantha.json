    "intro": "Ouratea oligantha, commonly known as the wax tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Ochnaceae and is characterized by its smooth, waxy, grayish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests and limestone areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercialized."
