    "intro": "Oligochaetochilus woollsii, commonly known as the Woolls' fern, is a rare and delicate epiphytic fern native to Australia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds with a unique, intricate venation pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in subtropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures are concealed within the leaf axils, and it produces spores rather than seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
