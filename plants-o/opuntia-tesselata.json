    "intro": "Opuntia tesselata, commonly known as the tessellated prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, segmented stems that are often covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which are typically followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Opuntia tesselata is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy pads. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in local cultures."
