    "intro": "Osmanthus kaoi, commonly known as the Kaoi sweet osmanthus, is a deciduous shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, small yellow to golden-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, emitting a sweet, honey-like scent. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that mature to a dark red color, containing a single seed. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a glossy, dark green surface with a slightly serrated edge. Osmanthus kaoi is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional Chinese medicine and as a source of aromatic oils."
