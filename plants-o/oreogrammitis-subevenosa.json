    "intro": "Oreogrammitis subevenosa, commonly known as the even-veined rock fern, is a species of fern characterized by its intricate and delicate fronds. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae, which is known for its small, often epiphytic or lithophytic species. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical or subtropical regions. Its leaves are narrow and have a distinct, even arrangement of veins, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The spores are produced in small, clustered structures on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
