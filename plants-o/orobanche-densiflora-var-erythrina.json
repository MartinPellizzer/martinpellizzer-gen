    "intro": "Orobanche densiflora var. erythrina, commonly known as the redroot broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in association with leguminous hosts such as Astragalus and Medicago. Its root system consists of haustoria, specialized structures that penetrate the roots of the host plant to extract water and nutrients. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host species."
