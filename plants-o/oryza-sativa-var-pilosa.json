    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. pilosa, commonly known as wild rice, is a grass species native to East Asia, particularly China and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender grains that are typically brown or black in color. The plant grows in wetland environments and has a tall, branched stem with small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are often cultivated for their nutritional value and are used in traditional cuisines. This variety is distinct from cultivated rice due to its wild origin and ecological adaptations."
