It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette at the base. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings.
