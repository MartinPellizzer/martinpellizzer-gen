    "intro": "Oreocarya monosperma, commonly known as the single-seeded mountain heath, is a shrub native to the high elevations of the western United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, and its leaves are small, leathery, and densely packed. Oreocarya monosperma has a unique reproductive strategy, producing a single seed per fruit, which is an adaptation to its limited pollination opportunities. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary response to cold, wind-exposed habitats."
