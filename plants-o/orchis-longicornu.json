    "intro": "Orchis longicornu, commonly known as the longhorn orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant features intricate, spurred petals and a distinctive, elongated lip that aids in pollination by insects. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged along the stem, contributing to its overall ornamental appearance. Orchis longicornu thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats."
