    "intro": "Osmanthus marginatus, commonly known as the fragrant osmanthus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that emit a strong, sweet fragrance, especially in the evening. These flowers are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, which are often used in traditional Chinese medicine and as a flavoring in teas and confections. Osmanthus marginatus thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and aromatic properties."
