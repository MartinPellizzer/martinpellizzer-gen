    "intro": "Oxytropis lambertii subsp. bigelovii, commonly known as Bigelow's locoweed, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small leaflets and produces clusters of pods that contain seeds. It is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments. Due to its toxicity to livestock, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
