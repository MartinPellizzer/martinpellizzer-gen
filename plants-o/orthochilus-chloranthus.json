    "intro": "Orthochilus chloranthus, commonly known as the green-flowered orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in spikes, which are often overlooked due to their muted color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
