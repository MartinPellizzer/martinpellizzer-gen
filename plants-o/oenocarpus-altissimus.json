    "intro": "Oenocarpus altissimus, commonly known as the coconut tree, is a tall, palm-like plant native to tropical regions. It produces large, fibrous fruits that contain a single, oily seed surrounded by a white, fleshy layer. The plant has a robust root system and can grow up to 30 meters in height. Its leaves are large, feather-like, and arranged in a rosette pattern around the trunk. The coconut fruit is not only a food source but also used for its fibrous husk, oil, and water."
