    "intro": "Oxydectes pycnadenia, commonly known as the dense-fruited oxydectes, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems, often growing in shaded, moist forest environments. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a smooth texture, and it produces small, red berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Due to habitat loss, Oxydectes pycnadenia is considered threatened and is the subject of conservation efforts in its native range."
