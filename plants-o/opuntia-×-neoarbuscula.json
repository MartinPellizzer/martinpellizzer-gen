    "intro": "Opuntia \u00d7 neoarbuscula, commonly known as the hybrid prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its flattened, stem-like structures called cladodes, which are often used for photosynthesis. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, followed by fleshy, edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia \u00d7 neoarbuscula is a hybrid between Opuntia ficus-indica and Opuntia polyacantha, resulting in a plant with a combination of traits from both parents. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments."
