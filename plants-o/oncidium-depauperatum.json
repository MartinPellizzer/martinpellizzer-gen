    "intro": "Oncidium depauperatum, commonly known as the poor orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a compact orchid with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. It requires bright, indirect light and consistent moisture to thrive. Oncidium depauperatum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
