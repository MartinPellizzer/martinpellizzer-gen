    "intro": "Onobrychis reticulosa, commonly known as the net-veined clover, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with a distinctive reticulate venation pattern and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
