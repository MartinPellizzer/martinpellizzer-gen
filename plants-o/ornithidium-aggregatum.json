    "intro": "Ornithidium aggregatum, commonly known as the clustered orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit and intricate, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests, where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by insects. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ornithidium aggregatum is considered a threatened species in its native range."
