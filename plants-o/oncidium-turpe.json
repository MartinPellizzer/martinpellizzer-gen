    "intro": "Oncidium turpe, commonly known as the brown orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendant, raceme-like inflorescence that bears numerous small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually yellow to brown in color, with a distinctive, wrinkled appearance. Oncidium turpe is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
