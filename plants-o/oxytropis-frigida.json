    "intro": "Oxytropis frigida, commonly known as the cold rock locoweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its low, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale blue or purple. The plant thrives in arid and high-altitude environments, often growing on rocky soils and in open meadows. It is adapted to cold climates and can survive in areas with limited moisture. Oxytropis frigida is part of the Fabaceae family, which includes many legumes capable of nitrogen fixation."
