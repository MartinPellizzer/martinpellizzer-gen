    "intro": "Ormocarpum suberosum, commonly known as the roughleaf sandverbena, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody, branched stems and small, opposite leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers during the summer months. Its fruits are dry, capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds. Ormocarpum suberosum is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species in dry landscapes."
