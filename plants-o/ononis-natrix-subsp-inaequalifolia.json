    "intro": "Ononis natrix subsp. inaequalifolia, commonly known as the unequal-leaved bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, often hairy stems that produce small, white or pale pink flowers. The leaves are alternate, with a distinctive shape that varies along the stem, giving it its subspecies name. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. The plant is characterized by its fragrant, four-petaled flowers and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
