    "intro": "Odontites simplex, commonly known as the simple toothed fern, is a small perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas, and is often found growing on limestone substrates. Odontites simplex is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage."
