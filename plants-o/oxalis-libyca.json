    "intro": "Oxalis libyca, commonly known as the Libyan wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which resemble those of the common wood sorrel, and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It belongs to the family Oxalidaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil environments. Oxalis libyca is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
