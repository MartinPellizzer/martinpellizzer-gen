    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 delargeana, commonly known as the Delargean bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in woodland and meadow habitats across Europe, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually a mix of brown, yellow, and white, with a distinctive bee-like shape. Ophrys \u00d7 delargeana is a short-lived perennial, often found in small populations due to its specific ecological requirements."
