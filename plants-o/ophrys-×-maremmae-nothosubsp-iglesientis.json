    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 maremmae nothosubsp. iglesientis, commonly known as the Maremma bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to southern Europe. It belongs to the genus Ophrys, which is known for its mimicry of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant produces strikingly intricate flowers that resemble female wasps, a characteristic feature of the Ophrys genus. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. This nothosubspecies is a result of natural hybridization between Ophrys maremmae and other related species, showcasing the genetic diversity within the Ophrys group."
