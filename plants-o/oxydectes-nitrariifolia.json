    "intro": "Oxydectes nitrariifolia, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Oxydectes nitrariifolia is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and drought, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
