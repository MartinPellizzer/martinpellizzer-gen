    "intro": "Odontocarya rusbyi, commonly known as the Rusby's odontocarya, is a rare and unique plant native to specific regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to red. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a rough texture that aids in water retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Odontocarya rusbyi is considered a species of conservation concern."
