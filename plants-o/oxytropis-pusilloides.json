    "intro": "Oxytropis pusilloides, commonly known as the dwarf locoweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, fern-like leaves and clusters of pink to purple flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soils and extreme temperatures. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife, though it can be toxic to livestock in high concentrations."
