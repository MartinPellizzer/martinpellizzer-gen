    "intro": "Ottelia fengshanensis, commonly known as the Fengshan water plant, is a rare aquatic plant native to China. It belongs to the family Hydrocharitaceae and is characterized by its submerged, ribbon-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, followed by small, spherical fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ottelia fengshanensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
