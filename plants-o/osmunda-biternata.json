    "intro": "Osmunda biternata, commonly known as the royal fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant has a distinctive underground rhizome system that supports its growth and reproduction. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. Osmunda biternata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
