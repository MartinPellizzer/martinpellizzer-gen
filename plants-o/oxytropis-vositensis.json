    "intro": "Oxytropis vositensis, commonly known as the Voskian bur pea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale pink to purple, typically blooming in the summer months. Oxytropis vositensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod, which aids in seed dispersal through mechanical means."
