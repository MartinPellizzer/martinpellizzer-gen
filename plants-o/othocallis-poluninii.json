    "intro": "Othocallis poluninii, commonly known as the Polunin's lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species that thrives in specific, often remote, and nutrient-poor environments. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its unique chemical composition, including the production of usnic acid, which contributes to its ecological niche. The thallus of Othocallis poluninii is typically crustose, forming a tightly adherent layer on rock surfaces, allowing it to withstand harsh environmental conditions. This lichen is often found in alpine or subarctic regions, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for ecological health."
