    "intro": "Orbignya huebneri, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and produces clusters of woody fruits containing edible seeds, known as nuts. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall and has a dense, buttressed root system that helps it thrive in wet, nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically pollinated by insects, while its fruits mature over several months. The plant plays a vital ecological role in the rainforest, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
