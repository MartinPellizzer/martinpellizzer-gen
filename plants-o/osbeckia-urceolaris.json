    "intro": "Osbeckia urceolaris, commonly known as the cup-shaped buckweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as cliffs and slopes. The plant features a basal rosette of fleshy, lobed leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. Its flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in a cup-like structure, giving it its common name. Osbeckia urceolaris is adapted to thrive in full sun and is often found in chaparral and desert scrub ecosystems."
