    "intro": "Ophrys biancae, commonly known as the white helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features a tall, slender stem with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically white or pale yellow with intricate patterns resembling female wasps, a feature known as mimicry. These flowers are pollinated by male wasps that attempt to mate with the flower's pseudostigma. Ophrys biancae thrives in woodland and shady habitats, preferring moist, well-drained soils."
