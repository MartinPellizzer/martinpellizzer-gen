    "intro": "Oreocarya osterhoutii, commonly known as the Osterhout's oreocarya, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the western United States. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its succulent leaves and erect growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or red, and it produces distinctive, triangular-shaped fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
