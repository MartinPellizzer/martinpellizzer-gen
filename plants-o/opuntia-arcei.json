    "intro": "Opuntia arcei, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed hairs that can cause irritation. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia arcei is adapted to arid environments and has a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in rocky or sandy soils. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in local cultures."
