    "intro": "Orobanche indica, commonly known as the Indian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a taproot system that attaches to the roots of its host, typically members of the legume family. The plant is found in various regions of Asia and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings. Its life cycle involves germination dependent on chemical signals from the host plant. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and yield of its host crops."
