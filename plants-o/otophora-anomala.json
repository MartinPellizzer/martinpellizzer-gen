    "intro": "Otophora anomala, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, horn-shaped floral structures that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can receive limited sunlight. Its flowers are usually small, with a complex arrangement of petals and sepals, and it produces a distinctive, fragrant scent to attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Otophora anomala is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
