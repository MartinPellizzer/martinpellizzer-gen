It features a short, tuberous rhizome and produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is notable for its striking, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Ornithogalum inclusum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in gardens."
