    "intro": "Oxydectes goyazensis, commonly known as the Goyazensis orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, upright stems and delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
