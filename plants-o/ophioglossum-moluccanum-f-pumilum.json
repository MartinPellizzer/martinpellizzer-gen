    "intro": "Ophioglossum moluccanum f. pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf adder's mouth fern, is a rare and ancient fern species characterized by its unique, tongue-like spore-bearing structure. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae, which is one of the oldest groups of vascular plants. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in tropical or subtropical regions. Its leaves are compound, with a distinctive, elongated shape that resembles an adder's mouth. The fern's spores are produced in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered along the underside of the leaves."
