It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lanceolate leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by insects.
