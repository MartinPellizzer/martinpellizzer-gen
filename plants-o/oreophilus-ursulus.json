    "intro": "Oreophilus ursulus, commonly known as the bear's foot orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, hairy leaves that resemble the claws of a bear. The plant produces small, pale yellow or greenish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Oreophilus ursulus thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
