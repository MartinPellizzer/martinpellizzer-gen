It features showy yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and entire, giving it its specific epithet \"integrifolia.\" It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open woods and prairies. The seeds are encased in a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
