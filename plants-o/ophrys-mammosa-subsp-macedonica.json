    "intro": "Ophrys mammosa subsp. macedonica, commonly known as the Macedonian bee orchid, is a specialized orchid native to the Balkan region. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing showy, bee-like flowers that are highly attractive to male bees. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range."
