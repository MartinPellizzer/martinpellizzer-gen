    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia f. fichtenbergii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and a single, slender flower spike that produces a single, pale yellow to greenish-white flower. The plant is adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodland areas with acidic soil. Its reproductive strategy relies on mycorrhizal associations with fungi, which are essential for seed germination. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this orchid is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
