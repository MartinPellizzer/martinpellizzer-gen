    "intro": "Oenocarpus intermedius, commonly known as the Brazilian palm or the oil palm, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fruit that contain a high amount of oil, making it economically significant for oil extraction. Its botanical structure includes a fibrous root system and a robust stem that supports its massive foliage. The species is closely related to other palms and is often cultivated for its commercial value in the region."
