    "intro": "Oxybaphus himalaicus, commonly known as the Himalayan oxybaphus, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family, and is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it adapts to cold and low-nutrient conditions. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
