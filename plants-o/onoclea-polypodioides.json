    "intro": "Onoclea polypodioides, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically 20\u201350 cm in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in association with other wetland plants. Onoclea polypodioides plays an important ecological role in maintaining the biodiversity of its habitat."
