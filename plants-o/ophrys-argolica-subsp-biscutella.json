    "intro": "Ophrys argolica subsp. biscutella, commonly known as the Argolic Bee Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
