    "intro": "Opuntia rarissima, commonly known as the rare prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-like stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by red or purple fruits that are edible. Opuntia rarissima is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
