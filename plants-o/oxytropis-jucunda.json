    "intro": "Oxytropis jucunda, commonly known as the silky locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, kidney-shaped pods that contain several seeds, and its leaves are typically hairy and trifoliate. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe, often growing in well-drained soils. Oxytropis jucunda is adapted to arid environments and is often found in areas with low precipitation and high sunlight exposure."
