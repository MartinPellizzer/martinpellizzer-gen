    "intro": "Osmia divergens, commonly known as the divergent mason bee, is a solitary bee species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Megachilidae and is characterized by its distinctive black and yellow coloration. The female constructs nests in hollow stems or pre-existing cavities, where she lays eggs and provisions them with pollen. Osmia divergens is an important pollinator, particularly for fruit and nut trees. Its life cycle is closely tied to the flowering periods of its host plants, making it a valuable species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
