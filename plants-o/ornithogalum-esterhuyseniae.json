    "intro": "Ornithogalum esterhuyseniae, commonly known as the Esterhuysenia star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spherical berries that ripen to a dark blue color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive."
