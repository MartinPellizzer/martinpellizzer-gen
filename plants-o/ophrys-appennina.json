    "intro": "Ophrys appennina, commonly known as the Apennine bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Italy. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure, which features a specialized lip that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of pale yellow to brownish flowers. Ophrys appennina is a rare and protected species, often found in specific microhabitats within its native range."
