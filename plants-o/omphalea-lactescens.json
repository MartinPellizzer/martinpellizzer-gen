    "intro": "Omphalea lactescens, commonly known as the milkweed vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its woody stem and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, which serves as a natural defense mechanism. Omphalea lactescens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks."
