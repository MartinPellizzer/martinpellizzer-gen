    "intro": "Orobanche lusitanica, commonly known as the Portuguese broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its highly reduced, often yellow or reddish, flowers. This plant typically parasitizes members of the legume family, such as Vicia and Lens, and is found in Mediterranean regions. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
