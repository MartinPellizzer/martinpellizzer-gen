It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert and steppe environments. Otostegia kotschyi plays a role in stabilizing soil in degraded areas and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
