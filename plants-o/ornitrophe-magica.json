    "intro": "Ornitrophe magica, commonly known as the Moonlight Bloom, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. Its most distinctive feature is its bioluminescent petals, which glow softly in the dark, attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a complex root system that absorbs minerals from the rocky soil, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Its leaves are covered in a fine, silvery waxy coating that reflects moonlight, giving it a mystical appearance. Botanists believe the plant contains unique phytochemicals that may have potential medicinal properties."
