    "intro": "Ochrosia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal ochrosia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are often pink or purple in color, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Its adaptability to salt spray and wind makes it an important component of coastal vegetation. Ochrosia littoralis plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in its native habitat."
