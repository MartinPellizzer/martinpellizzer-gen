This plant is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, adapting well to arid conditions. The leaves are usually hairy, giving the plant its common name, while the flowers are small and white, often clustered in umbrella-like structures. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
