    "intro": "Ornithogalum fistulosum subsp. subalpinum, commonly known as the alpine cowpea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant features strap-like, linear leaves and produces clusters of white or pale green flowers. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that help it survive harsh winter conditions. This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
