    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 vicina nothosubsp. vicina, commonly known as the lesser bee orchid, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, featuring a pouch-like labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats across Europe. It produces showy, yellowish-green flowers with a prominent beard-like structure at the base of the lip. Due to its hybrid nature, it is often found in areas where its parent species overlap, contributing to its ecological and botanical significance."
