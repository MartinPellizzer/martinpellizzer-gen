    "intro": "Oxydectes sagrana, commonly known as the sacred orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and purple. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Oxydectes sagrana is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its cultural significance in indigenous communities."
