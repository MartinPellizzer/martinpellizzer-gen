    "intro": "Oreobolus obtusangulus f. borealis, commonly known as the northern sandspurry, is a variant of the sandspurry species native to arctic and alpine regions. It is a low-growing, herbaceous plant characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils, often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Its leaves are typically rounded and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. This subspecies is adapted to harsh climatic conditions, making it a resilient component of polar and high-altitude ecosystems."
