    "intro": "Ornitrophe serrata, commonly known as the saw-toothed orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a slender, upright stem with a fibrous root system and lance-shaped leaves that are serrated along the edges. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Ornitrophe serrata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ecological role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
