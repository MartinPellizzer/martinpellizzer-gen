    "intro": "Odontotrichum calvum, commonly known as the smooth hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of fine, hair-like leaves that are often covered with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often moist or wetland habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological importance, it is considered a valuable indicator species for wetland health."
