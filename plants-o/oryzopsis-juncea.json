    "intro": "Oryzopsis juncea, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open woodlands, meadows, and disturbed sites, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Oryzopsis juncea is often used in ecological restoration due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
