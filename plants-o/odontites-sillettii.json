    "intro": "Odontites sillettii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada toothplant, is a rare flowering plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a small perennial herb with basal leaves that are deeply lobed and resemble teeth, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as meadows and forested areas. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
