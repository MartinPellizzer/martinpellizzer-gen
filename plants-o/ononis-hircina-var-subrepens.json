    "intro": "Ononis hircina var. subrepens, commonly known as creeping whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe. It features small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has a mat-forming habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor environments. This species is often found in coastal areas, cliffs, and dry meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
