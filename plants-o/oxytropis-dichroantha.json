    "intro": "Oxytropis dichroantha, commonly known as the two-colored milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow or white flowers in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Oxytropis dichroantha is adapted to poor soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
