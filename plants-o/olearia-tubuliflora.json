    "intro": "Olearia tubuliflora, commonly known as the mountain daisy or silver daisy, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It features silvery, woolly foliage that provides a striking visual contrast to its bright yellow flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Olearia tubuliflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
