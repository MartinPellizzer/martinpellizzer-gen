    "intro": "Orobanche krylowii, commonly known as the Krylov's broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its distinctive, often reddish or yellowish, floral structures. This species typically infests plants in the legume family, such as vetches and clovers, by attaching to their roots with specialized haustoria. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, producing a unique, sometimes fragrant aroma. Orobanche krylowii is found in various regions, including parts of Europe and Asia, and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
