    "intro": "Oxalis robusta, commonly known as the wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that resemble those of the true sorrel. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Oxalis robusta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care. It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for garden ecosystems."
