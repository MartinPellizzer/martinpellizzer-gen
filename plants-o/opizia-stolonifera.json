    "intro": "Opizia stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping opuntia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its fleshy, spine-tipped stems that grow horizontally along the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, followed by small, edible fruits. Its thick, waxy leaves store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. Opizia stolonifera is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
