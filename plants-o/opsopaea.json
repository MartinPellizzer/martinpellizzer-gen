    "intro": "Opsopaea, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. It typically grows in damp, nutrient-rich soils and thrives in areas with high water tables. The plant features a tall, slender stem with whorled leaves and produces showy, violet or purple flowers in late summer. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the waterlogged environment. Opsopaea plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by supporting pollinators and contributing to biodiversity."
