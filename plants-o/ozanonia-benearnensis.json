    "intro": "Ozanonia benearnensis, commonly known as the Benear's ozanonia, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green hue. Due to habitat loss, Ozanonia benearnensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
