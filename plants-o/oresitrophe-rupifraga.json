    "intro": "Oresitrophe rupifraga, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a dense cluster at the top of its stems. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Oresitrophe rupifraga is adapted to harsh climates and is often found in high-altitude habitats where few plants can survive."
