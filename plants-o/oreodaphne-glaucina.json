It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in a whitish, waxy bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by oval, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
