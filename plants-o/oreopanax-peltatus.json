    "intro": "Oreopanax peltatus, commonly known as the broad-leafed arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, tropical environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color, followed by berries that contain several seeds. It is often found growing in moist, shaded areas such as forests or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and tropical landscapes."
