    "intro": "Oxalis hypopilina, commonly known as the small-leaf wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of South America. It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and woodlands. Its foliage and flowers are often covered in fine hairs, and it has a rhizomatous root system that aids in its spread. Oxalis hypopilina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
