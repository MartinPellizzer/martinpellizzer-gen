It features slender, erect stems that are densely covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue to purple in color, arranged in loose clusters at the tips of the branches. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its overall rugged appearance. This species is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open fields and along coastal areas."
