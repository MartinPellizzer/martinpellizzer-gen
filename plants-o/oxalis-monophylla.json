    "intro": "Oxalis monophylla, commonly known as the nettleleaf wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet resembling a heart shape with a serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Oxalis monophylla is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
