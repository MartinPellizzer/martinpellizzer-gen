    "intro": "Odontites luteus subsp. bonifaciensis, commonly known as the yellow toothplant, is a flowering plant species native to parts of Europe and North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are covered in fine hairs, and it produces numerous small, daisy-like blooms in the summer months. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique floral structure."
