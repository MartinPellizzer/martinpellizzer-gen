    "intro": "Ophrys insectifera subsp. insectifera, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking floral morphology, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, with a pouch-like structure called a labellum that mimics the appearance of an insect. The subsp. insectifera is particularly noted for its specialized pollination mechanism, where male bees are deceived into attempting to mate with the flower, thereby transferring pollen."
