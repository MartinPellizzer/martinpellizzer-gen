It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing vibrant blue to purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
