    "intro": "Oncidium alvarezii, commonly known as the Alvarez orchid, is a tropical orchid species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically come in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the humid environments it inhabits. Oncidium alvarezii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
