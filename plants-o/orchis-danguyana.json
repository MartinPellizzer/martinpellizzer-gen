It is a member of the Orchidaceae family, characterized by its complex floral structures and specialized pollination mechanisms. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and thrives in woodland or meadow habitats. Its flowers are usually violet or purple in color, with a distinctive hooded shape that aids in attracting specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
