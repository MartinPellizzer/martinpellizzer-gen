    "intro": "Osmunda cinnamomea var. auriculata, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive cinnamon-colored fronds. It features a tall, central fiddlehead that unfurls into a broad, bipinnate frond with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in lines along the veins. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its role in maintaining ecological balance in wetland habitats."
