    "intro": "Oreobroma triphyllum, commonly known as the three-leaf mountainstar, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats such as pine woods and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and the flowers are usually purple or pink in color. Oreobroma triphyllum is often found in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
