    "intro": "Oberonia pumila, commonly known as the small-lobed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as rainforests and mountainous regions. The plant features a slender, creeping rhizome and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in a spike. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. Oberonia pumila is notable for its unique floral structure and is often found in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi."
