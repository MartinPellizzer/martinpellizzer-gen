    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza harrisonii, commonly known as Harrison's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The plant typically grows on the branches of host trees, deriving some of its nutrients from the host while also performing photosynthesis. Its small, white or pale green flowers are often clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, Ophiorrhiza harrisonii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its habitat."
