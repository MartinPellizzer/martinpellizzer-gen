    "intro": "Ophrys rhodostephane, commonly known as the red-stemmed bee orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to southern Europe. This terrestrial herbaceous plant is characterized by its tall, erect stem that often bears a reddish hue, especially in the lower parts. Its flowers are highly specialized, with a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a dense spike, showcasing the genus Ophrys' unique floral morphology."
