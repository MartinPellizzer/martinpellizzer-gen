    "intro": "Ottonia villosa, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in North America. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant has a sprawling growth habit with fleshy, hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Ottonia villosa plays a unique role in its ecosystem by contributing to nutrient cycling in nutrient-poor wetland environments."
