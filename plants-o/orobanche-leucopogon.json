    "intro": "Orobanche leucopogon, commonly known as the white-stemmed broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various parts of Europe and Asia. The plant typically grows in association with grasses and other herbaceous plants, often in disturbed or open habitats. Its flowers are small and white or pale purple, arranged in a dense spike, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants."
