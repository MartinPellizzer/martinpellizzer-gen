It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces elongated, spiny pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, alkaline soils and is often found in steppe and semi-desert environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally used in ecological restoration projects."
