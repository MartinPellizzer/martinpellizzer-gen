    "intro": "Osmunda lunaria, commonly known as the moon fern, is a species of fern belonging to the Osmundaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate fronds that resemble a fan shape, with each pinna having a narrow, linear appearance. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of North America, Europe, and Asia. Osmunda lunaria thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
