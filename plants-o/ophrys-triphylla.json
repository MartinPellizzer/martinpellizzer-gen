    "intro": "Ophrys triphylla, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a striking orchid species native to Europe. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually yellow or green with a distinctive black and white pattern. Ophrys triphylla is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, often with a single, large, bee-shaped bloom."
