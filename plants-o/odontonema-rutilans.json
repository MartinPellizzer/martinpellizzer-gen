    "intro": "Odontonema rutilans, commonly known as the golden flame plant, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Odontonema rutilans is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its ornate appearance and ability to add color to gardens and indoor spaces."
