    "intro": "Orthophytum lucidum, commonly known as the shining orthophytum, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy, translucent coating, giving it a shiny appearance. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
