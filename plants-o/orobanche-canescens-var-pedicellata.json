    "intro": "Orobanche canescens var. pedicellata, commonly known as the pale broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or pale green stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, often parasitizing members of the Fabaceae family. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and productivity of its host plants."
