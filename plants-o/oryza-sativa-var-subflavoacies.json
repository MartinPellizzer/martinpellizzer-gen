    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. subflavoacies, commonly known as the golden rice variety, is a subspecies of rice characterized by its unique yellow to golden grain color. This trait is primarily due to the high accumulation of beta-carotene in the endosperm, which gives it its distinctive hue. It is a genetically modified variety developed to address vitamin A deficiency in human populations. The plant exhibits typical rice morphology, with long, slender leaves and panicles that produce small, white flowers. Its botanical features make it an important subject in agricultural and nutritional research."
