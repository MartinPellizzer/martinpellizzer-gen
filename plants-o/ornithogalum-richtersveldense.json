    "intro": "Ornithogalum richtersveldense, commonly known as Richtersveld moonflower, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the Richtersveld region of South Africa. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its striking white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, berry-like fruits that contain toxic seeds. It thrives in arid, rocky environments and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
