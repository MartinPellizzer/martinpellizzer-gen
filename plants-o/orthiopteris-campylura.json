    "intro": "Orthiopteris campylura, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant in the sediment and facilitating nutrient absorption. Orthiopteris campylura plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
