    "intro": "Orchis militaris f. arenaria, commonly known as the sandy soldier orchid, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a distinctive hooded labellum. The plant typically produces violet or purple flowers with a striking contrast of white and yellow in the center. It is found in specific habitats such as coastal dunes and sandy heaths, where it thrives in well-drained conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in certain regions."
