    "intro": "Oryctina piranii, commonly known as the Piranha orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful blooms that often display a mix of red, orange, and yellow hues. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives on the forest floor or as an epiphyte on trees. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and soil, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. Oryctina piranii is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting various insect and bird species."
