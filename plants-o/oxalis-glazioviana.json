    "intro": "Oxalis glazioviana, commonly known as the Glaziov's wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. Its foliage contains oxalic acid, which can be toxic if ingested in large quantities. Oxalis glazioviana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
