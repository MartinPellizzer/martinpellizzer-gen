    "intro": "Oncidium subulifolium, commonly known as the needle-leaf orchid, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces striking clusters of fragrant, yellow-green flowers with a distinctive white lip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Oncidium subulifolium is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
