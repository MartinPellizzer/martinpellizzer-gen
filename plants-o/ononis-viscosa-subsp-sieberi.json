    "intro": "Ononis viscosa subsp. sieberi, commonly known as the Sieber's sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky habitats in Central Asia. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. This subspecies is valued for its resilience and is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded soils."
