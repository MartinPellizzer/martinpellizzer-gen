    "intro": "Onoclea sensibilis, commonly known as the sensitive fern, is a fern species native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are sensitive to touch, hence its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. The sensitive fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
