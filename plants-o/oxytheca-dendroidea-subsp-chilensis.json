It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in temperate regions with well-drained soils, often in coastal or mountainous areas. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, followed by berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
