    "intro": "Orchis maculata var. orophila, commonly known as the alpine spotted orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive spotted leaves and tall, slender flowering stems. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing small, pinkish-white flowers with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
