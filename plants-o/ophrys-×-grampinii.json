    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 grampinii, commonly known as the Grampian bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is native to the Scottish Highlands and is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in damp, shaded woodlands and has a short, upright stem with a single, showy flower. Its botanical features include a basal rosette of leaves and a specialized labellum that plays a key role in its deceptive pollination strategy. Ophrys \u00d7 grampinii is a rare and protected plant, highlighting the unique adaptations of orchids in their ecological niches."
