    "intro": "Oxybaphus violaceus var. parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered violet oxeye, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, glaucous leaves with a bluish-white coating. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers clustered in a dense, spherical inflorescence called a head. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in local ecosystems."
