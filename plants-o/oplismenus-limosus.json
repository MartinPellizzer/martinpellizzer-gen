    "intro": "Oplismenus limosus, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland areas of the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Oplismenus limosus plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees, in its native habitat."
