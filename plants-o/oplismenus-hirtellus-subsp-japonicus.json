    "intro": "Oplismenus hirtellus subsp. japonicus, commonly known as Japanese spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features upright, slender stems that are often tinged with red, and it produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in late spring. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It is characterized by its ability to spread via rhizomes, forming dense mats that can be invasive in certain environments. This species is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
