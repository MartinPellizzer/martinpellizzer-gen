    "intro": "Ophrys riojana, commonly known as the Rioja orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a complex labellum that mimics the appearance of a female insect, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, typically in open, sunny habitats. Its growth is closely tied to specific soil conditions and microclimates, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ophrys riojana is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
