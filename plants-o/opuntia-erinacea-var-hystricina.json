    "intro": "Opuntia erinacea var. hystricina, commonly known as the red-crested cactus, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are typically green with red or pink spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, edible fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and the stems are ribbed, allowing for efficient water storage. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
