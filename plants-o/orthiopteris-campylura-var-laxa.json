    "intro": "Orthiopteris campylura var. laxa, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern family (Adiantaceae). It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often broader and more spreading than those of the typical species. The fronds are usually light green and have a graceful, arching appearance, with finely divided segments that give it a lacy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
