    "intro": "Oryzopsis verrucosa, commonly known as the hairy beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairie and steppe habitats. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-like cluster of small, two-ranked flowers. Oryzopsis verrucosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
