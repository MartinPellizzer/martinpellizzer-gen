    "intro": "Oenanthe pimpinelloides, commonly known as narrow-leaved water dropwort, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along streambanks and wet meadows. The plant features slender, upright stems with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in late spring to early summer. Oenanthe pimpinelloides is characterized by its aromatic, often peppery scent and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
