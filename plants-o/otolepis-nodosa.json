    "intro": "Otolepis nodosa, commonly known as the nodding marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often forming dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively, while its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Otolepis nodosa plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
