It is characterized by its striking yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The flowers have four petals and produce capsule fruits that release seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal."
