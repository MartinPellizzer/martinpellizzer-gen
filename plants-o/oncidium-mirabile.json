    "intro": "Oncidium mirabile, commonly known as the Orchid of the Month, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescence that bears numerous fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding environment, and it thrives in warm, humid conditions with bright indirect light. Oncidium mirabile is prized for its beauty and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
