    "intro": "Orthocarpus brevistylus, commonly known as the short-styled orthocarpus, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate regions and has finely divided, aromatic leaves. Its small, white or yellowish flowers are clustered in umbrella-like structures, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
