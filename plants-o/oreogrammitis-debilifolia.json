    "intro": "Oreogrammitis debilifolia, commonly known as the slender fern, is a small, delicate fern species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant features a slender, creeping rhizome with finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a soft, silvery pubescence. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Oreogrammitis debilifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
