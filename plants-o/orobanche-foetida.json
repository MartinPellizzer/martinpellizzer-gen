    "intro": "Orobanche foetida, commonly known as the stinking broom. This parasitic plant lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically growing in association with legumes. It is characterized by its yellowish to reddish stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers, and it is known for its strong, unpleasant odor. Orobanche foetida is often found in disturbed soils and can be a problematic weed in agricultural settings."
