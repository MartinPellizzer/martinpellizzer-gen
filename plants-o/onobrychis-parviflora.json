    "intro": "Onobrychis parviflora, commonly known as small-flowered bur clover, is a low-growing perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellow to reddish-brown pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in dry, sandy soils and making it drought-tolerant. It is often used in erosion control and as a forage crop for livestock. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it beneficial for soil enrichment."
