    "intro": "Oreocereus hendriksenianus f. densilanatus, commonly known as the dense-leaved cactus, is a unique cactus species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems that are covered in short, spiny tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom during the warm season, typically in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is a relatively rare and endangered species in its native range."
