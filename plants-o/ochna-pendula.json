    "intro": "Ochna pendula, commonly known as the hanging ochna, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has simple, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Ochna pendula is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
