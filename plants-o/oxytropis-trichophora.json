It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Oxytropis trichophora is often found in sagebrush steppe and prairie habitats."
