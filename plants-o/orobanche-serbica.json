    "intro": "Orobanche serbica, commonly known as the Serbian broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of various species in the legume family. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to regions of Europe and the Middle East, often found in grasslands and agricultural fields. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops, making it a concern for agricultural management."
