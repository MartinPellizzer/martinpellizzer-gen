    "intro": "Orobanche californica subsp. jepsonii, commonly known as the Jepson's dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is native to California and typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly reduced morphology with no true leaves. It is often found parasitizing species of Astragalus and other legumes. Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem as a parasite."
