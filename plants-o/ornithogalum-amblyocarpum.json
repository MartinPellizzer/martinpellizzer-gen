    "intro": "Ornithogalum amblyocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces a spike of white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in a raceme. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that help it survive dry periods and regenerate each growing season. Ornithogalum amblyocarpum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soils."
