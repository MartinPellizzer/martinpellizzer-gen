    "intro": "Oncidium harryanum, commonly known as the Harry's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with red and purple markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Oncidium harryanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
