    "intro": "Oncidium carinatum, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a tropical orchid species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a sweet, spicy scent. The plant has strap-like leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture, and it thrives in bright, indirect light. Oncidium carinatum requires well-draining soil and regular watering to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
