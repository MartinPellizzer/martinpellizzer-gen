    "intro": "Oxalis biloba, commonly known as wood sorrel, is a flowering plant belonging to the Oxalidaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Americas and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It produces edible leaves and flowers, though they should be consumed in moderation due to their oxalic acid content. Oxalis biloba is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and delicate blooms."
