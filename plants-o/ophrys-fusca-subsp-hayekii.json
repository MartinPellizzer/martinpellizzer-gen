    "intro": "Ophrys fusca subsp. hayekii, commonly known as the Hayek's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
