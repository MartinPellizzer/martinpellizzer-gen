    "intro": "Otillis zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon star gooseberry, is a tropical shrub native to Sri Lanka and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly rough texture. Otillis zeylanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local medicine."
