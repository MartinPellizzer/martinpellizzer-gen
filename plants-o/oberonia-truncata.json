    "intro": "Oberonia truncata, commonly known as the truncated orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, humid forest environments, often on rocky or wooded slopes. The plant features a short, erect stem with a single or few leaves, and it produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white, yellow, or green. Its roots are often specialized for absorbing nutrients from the forest floor. Oberonia truncata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
