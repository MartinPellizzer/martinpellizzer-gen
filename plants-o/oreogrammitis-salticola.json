    "intro": "Oreogrammitis salticola, commonly known as the salt-tolerant moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its small, closely packed leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. This plant thrives in saline or coastal environments, demonstrating a high tolerance for salt and desiccation. Its reproductive structures, called capsules, are borne on short, upright stalks and release spores into the air. Oreogrammitis salticola plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is often found in rocky or sandy substrates."
