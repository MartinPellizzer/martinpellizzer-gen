It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and yellow, typically appearing in clusters, and it is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. Othonna obtusiloba is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
