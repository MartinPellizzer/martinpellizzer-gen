    "intro": "Opuntia pampeana, commonly known as the Pampas prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina and Uruguay. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and are often ribbed. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible fruits that are similar in appearance to other Opuntia species. Opuntia pampeana is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh climates. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of the local ecosystem."
