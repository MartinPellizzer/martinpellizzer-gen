It is a perennial herbaceous plant with tall, erect stems that bear showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and woodland edges. Its flowers are characterized by their intricate structure, with three sepals and three petals, one of which is often modified into a hood-like labellum. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is often found in the wild in parts of Europe."
