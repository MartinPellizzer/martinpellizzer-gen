    "intro": "Ochna odora, commonly known as the African star flower, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which are clustered in star-like formations, and its alternate, simple, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fleshy, red or orange berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Ochna odora thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or savanna habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens in warm climates."
