    "intro": "Orobanche grayana, commonly known as the gray anthra, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. The plant produces showy, often purple or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific host species, typically those in the legume family. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host plants."
