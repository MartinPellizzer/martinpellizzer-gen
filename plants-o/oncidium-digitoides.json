    "intro": "Oncidium digitoides, commonly known as the Orchid of the Moon, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features slender, wiry stems and produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-green flowers with intricate patterns. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Oncidium digitoides is relatively easy to care for, needing moderate watering and well-draining potting media."
