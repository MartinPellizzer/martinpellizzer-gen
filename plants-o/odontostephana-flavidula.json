    "intro": "Odontostephana flavidula, commonly known as the yellow-flowered rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open woodlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a short, erect stem with a few flowering spikes. Odontostephana flavidula is relatively rare and has specific ecological requirements, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
