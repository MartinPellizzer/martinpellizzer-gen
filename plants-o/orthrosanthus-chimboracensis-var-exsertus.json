    "intro": "Orthrosanthus chimboracensis var. exsertus, commonly known as the Chimborazo bellflower, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the Andean region of Ecuador. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, typically above 4,000 meters, where it adapts to cold temperatures and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. This variant is distinguished by its elongated, exserted stamens, which give it its specific epithet."
