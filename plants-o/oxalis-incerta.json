    "intro": "Oxalis incerta, commonly known as the uncertain wood sorrel, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb with trifoliate leaves resembling those of true sorrel, though it lacks the characteristic scent. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, spherical fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Oxalis incerta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
