    "intro": "Oncidium forbesii, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, showy inflorescences that resemble butterflies, with bright yellow petals and a contrasting green lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. It produces fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring or early summer. Oncidium forbesii requires bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
