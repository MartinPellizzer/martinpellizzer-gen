    "intro": "Ophrys cornuta subsp. heldreichii, commonly known as the Heldreich's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, thriving in mountainous regions with cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its ecological specificity and conservation status."
