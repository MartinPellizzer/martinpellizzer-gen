    "intro": "Ononis microsperma, commonly known as lesser whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features slender stems with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender pedicels. Its seeds are minute and have a distinctive, pitted surface, aiding in their dispersal by wind. Ononis microsperma thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and along riverbanks."
