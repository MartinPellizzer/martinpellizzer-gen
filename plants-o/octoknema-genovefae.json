    "intro": "Octoknema genovefae, commonly known as the Genovefa's octoknema, is a rare tropical shrub native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic plants known for their medicinal properties. The plant is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of tiny, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of pink and purple. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
