    "intro": "Othonna cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved othonna, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and linear, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Othonna cuneata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and as a landscape plant."
