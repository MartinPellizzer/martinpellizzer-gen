It features a short, underground bulb and produces a basal rosette of rigid, linear leaves. The plant blooms with umbels of white or pale yellow flowers, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is often grown in gardens across temperate regions."
