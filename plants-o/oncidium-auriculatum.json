    "intro": "Oncidium auriculatum, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, arching inflorescences that bear numerous yellow flowers with a distinctive butterfly-like shape. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters, often lasting for several weeks. Oncidium auriculatum requires bright, indirect light and well-draining potting media to thrive."
