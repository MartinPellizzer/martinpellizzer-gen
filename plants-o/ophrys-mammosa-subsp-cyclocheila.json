    "intro": "Ophrys mammosa subsp. cyclocheila, commonly known as the cyclocheila bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a pouch-like structure that mimics the appearance of an insect, aiding in pollination by male bees. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
