    "intro": "Oxytropis canopatula, commonly known as the western crownvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant grows in a variety of habitats, including disturbed soils and dry slopes, and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Oxytropis canopatula is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
