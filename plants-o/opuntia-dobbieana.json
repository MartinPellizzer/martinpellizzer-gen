    "intro": "Opuntia dobbieana, commonly known as the Dobbie's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in the spring, followed by edible fruits that are typically red or orange in color. Opuntia dobbieana is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its structure and growth habits make it a notable species within the Cactaceae family."
