    "intro": "Opuntia bartramii, commonly known as the Florida prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems that are covered in clusters of spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems for survival in arid conditions. Opuntia bartramii plays an important role in its ecosystem, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
