    "intro": "Oxytropis ochotensis, commonly known as Siberian locoweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold climates of eastern Siberia and northern Mongolia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, often found in steppe and tundra environments. It produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its survival in harsh, open landscapes."
