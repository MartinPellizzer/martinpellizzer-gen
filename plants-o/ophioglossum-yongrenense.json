    "intro": "Ophioglossum yongrenense, commonly known as Yongren's adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae, which is characterized by its primitive morphology and limited distribution. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a long, narrow, tongue-like leaf that is typically green and slightly curled. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its leaf, which is a key feature of its reproductive biology. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, Ophioglossum yongrenense is considered an endangered species."
