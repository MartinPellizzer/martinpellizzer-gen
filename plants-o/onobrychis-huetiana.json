    "intro": "Onobrychis huetiana, commonly known as the Huet's vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. It has a creeping growth habit and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its drought tolerance and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
