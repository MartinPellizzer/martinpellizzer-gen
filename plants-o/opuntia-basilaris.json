    "intro": "Opuntia basilaris, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems, which are covered in spines and glochids, making it well adapted to arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, typically in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry conditions. Opuntia basilaris plays an important role in desert ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
