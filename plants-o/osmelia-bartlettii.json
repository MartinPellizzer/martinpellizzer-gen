    "intro": "Osmelia bartlettii, commonly known as the Bartlett's osmelia, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, white or greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its blooming period occurs in early spring, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss, Osmelia bartlettii is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
