    "intro": "Orobanche nana subsp. melitensis, commonly known as the Cyprus dwarf broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It is native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Cyprus, and thrives in dry, calcareous soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a spicate inflorescence, and it is often found growing on the roots of various host plants such as legumes and grasses. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of suitable host species, making it an important component of certain semi-arid ecosystems. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
