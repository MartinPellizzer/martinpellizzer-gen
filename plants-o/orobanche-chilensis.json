    "intro": "Orobanche chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of species like Astragalus and Medicago. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It is often found in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in disturbed soils. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
