    "intro": "Ottelia cordata, commonly known as the water starwort, is a semi-aquatic plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds and marshes, where it can receive adequate sunlight. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged, with some leaves emerging above the water surface. Its small, white flowers bloom in clusters, adding a delicate appearance to its aquatic habitat. Ottelia cordata plays a role in stabilizing water ecosystems and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
