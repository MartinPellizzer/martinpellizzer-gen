    "intro": "Oxytropis uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland ecosystems. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, and the plant is adapted to arid conditions with deep root systems. Oxytropis uniflora is also known for its toxic properties, containing alkaloids that can be harmful to livestock."
