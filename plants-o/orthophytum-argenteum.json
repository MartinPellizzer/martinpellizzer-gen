    "intro": "Orthophytum argenteum, commonly known as the silver foxtail, is a succulent plant native to South America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Orthophytum argenteum is often grown as an ornamental plant for its unique foliage and drought tolerance."
