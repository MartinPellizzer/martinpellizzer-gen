    "intro": "Ourisia alpina, commonly known as the alpine ourisia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it adapts to cold, rocky environments. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens with suitable conditions."
