    "intro": "Osteospermum incanum subsp. incanum, commonly known as the silver osteospermum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white to pink petals. The plant typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
