    "intro": "Ophrys japonica, commonly known as the Japanese bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Japan and parts of Korea. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait known as mimicry. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with a dark, hairy labellum that aids in attracting pollinators. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Ophrys japonica is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
