    "intro": "Oncidium glossomystax, commonly known as the Orchid of the Moon, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features pendulous, racemose inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to yellow and pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are strap-like, glossy, and arranged in a fan shape, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Oncidium glossomystax thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil with consistent moisture."
