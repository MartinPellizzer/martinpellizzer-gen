    "intro": "Oryctina subaphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Oryctina subaphylla is typically found growing on rocky outcrops and in sandy soils, where it thrives in full sun."
