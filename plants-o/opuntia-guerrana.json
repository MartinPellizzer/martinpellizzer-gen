    "intro": "Opuntia guerrana, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in spines and are used for photosynthesis. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit, called a tuna, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. Opuntia guerrana is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food."
