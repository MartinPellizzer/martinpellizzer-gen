    "intro": "Ononis zygantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Ononis zygantha is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a characteristic species of dry, open habitats."
