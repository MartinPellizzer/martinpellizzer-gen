    "intro": "Ornithogalum undulatum, commonly known as the undulating star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a rosette of narrow, sword-shaped leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its bulbous underground stem, which serves as a storage organ for nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Ornithogalum undulatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in floral arrangements."
