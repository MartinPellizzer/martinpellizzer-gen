    "intro": "Ononis paralias, commonly known as seaside centaury, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shorelines. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Ononis paralias is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy species of maritime environments."
