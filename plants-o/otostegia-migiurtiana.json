    "intro": "Otostegia migiurtiana, commonly known as the African daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers, which are borne on short, hairy stems. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Otostegia migiurtiana is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions."
