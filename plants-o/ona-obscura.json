    "intro": "Ona obscura, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is a terrestrial orchid with a unique growth habit, featuring a single, slender stem and a single, showy white or pale pink flower. The plant has no leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption from the surrounding soil. It thrives in wet, acidic pine flatwoods and requires specific environmental conditions to survive. Due to habitat loss and its secretive nature, Ona obscura is considered critically endangered."
