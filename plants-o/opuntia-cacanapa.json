    "intro": "Opuntia cacanapa, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems, which are covered in small, sharp spines called glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are modified into photosynthetic stems, a common adaptation in arid environments. Opuntia cacanapa is also valued for its ability to thrive in hot, dry conditions and for its ornamental and culinary uses."
