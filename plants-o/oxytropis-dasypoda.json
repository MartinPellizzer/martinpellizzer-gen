    "intro": "Oxytropis dasypoda, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, compound leaves with small, hairy stipules, and pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Oxytropis dasypoda plays a role in nitrogen fixation and provides forage for wildlife and livestock."
