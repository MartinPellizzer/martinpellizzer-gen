It features trifoliate leaves that are often reddish or purple in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in gardens and wild areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it both ornamental and invasive in some regions."
