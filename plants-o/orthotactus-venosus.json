    "intro": "Orthotactus venosus, commonly known as the veined orthotactus, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant features a thallus with a distinct, lobed structure and is characterized by its intricate network of veins, which give it its common name. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophores, are borne on the upper surface of the thallus. Orthotactus venosus plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides microhabitat for various small organisms in its native ecosystems."
