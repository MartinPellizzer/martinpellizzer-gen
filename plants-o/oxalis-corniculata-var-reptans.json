    "intro": "Oxalis corniculata var. reptans, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and small, yellow flowers that resemble those of true sorrels. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its stems spread horizontally, forming dense mats that can suppress other vegetation. Oxalis corniculata var. reptans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for ground cover."
