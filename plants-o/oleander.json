    "intro": "Oleander, commonly known as the rose of Sharon, is a flowering shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, pink, white, and yellow. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and is known for its ability to thrive in hot, dry climates. Oleander is also notable for its toxicity, as all parts of the plant contain cardiac glycosides that can be harmful to humans and animals. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and resilience."
