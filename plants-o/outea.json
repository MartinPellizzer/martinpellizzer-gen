    "intro": "Outea, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon basin. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its large, compound leaves and striking yellow flowers. The tree produces a hard-shelled fruit that contains edible seeds, which are the source of the popular Brazil nut. Outea species are often found in lowland rainforests and play a vital role in the ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, some Outea species are now considered threatened."
