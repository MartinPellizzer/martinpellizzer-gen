    "intro": "Ophrys insectifera var. lutea, commonly known as the yellow bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. The species is known for its specialized pollination mechanism, which relies on the deceptive attraction of male bees."
