The plant has trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces elongated pods containing seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Oxytropis kazidanica is often used in traditional medicine and has potential for soil stabilization in degraded lands."
