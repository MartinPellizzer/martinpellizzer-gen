It features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, and it produces clusters of white or pale green flowers with a distinctive bell-like shape. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with its underground bulb storing water and nutrients. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is known for its ability to thrive in harsh conditions. The flowers are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators such as bees and moths."
