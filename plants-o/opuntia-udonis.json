    "intro": "Opuntia udonis, commonly known as the Peruvian prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Peru and Ecuador. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in sharp spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, typically in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia udonis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
