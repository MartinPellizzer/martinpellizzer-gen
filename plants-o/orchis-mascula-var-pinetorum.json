    "intro": "Orchis mascula var. pinetorum, commonly known as the pine barren orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the northeastern United States. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as pine barrens and sandy soils, where it forms dense colonies. The plant produces showy, violet to purple flowers with a distinctive spurred lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to habitat loss and ecological disturbances, it is listed as endangered in several states."
