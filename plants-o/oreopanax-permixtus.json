It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged and have a distinctive, often variegated appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
