    "intro": "Oxalis gilliesii, commonly known as the mountain wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features heart-shaped leaves with distinctive red veins and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of yellow and pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh native climate. Oxalis gilliesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
