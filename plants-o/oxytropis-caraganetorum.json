    "intro": "Oxytropis caraganetorum, commonly known as Caraganetum oxytropis, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, leathery pods that contain several seeds, and it thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils. It is often found in steppe and semi-desert environments, where it plays a role in soil stabilization. Oxytropis caraganetorum is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits surrounding vegetation."
