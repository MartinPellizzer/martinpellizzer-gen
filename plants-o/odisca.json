    "intro": "Odisca, commonly known as the coral tree, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Lythraceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers that resemble coral, hence their common name. Odisca species are typically shrubs or small trees, native to regions in Africa, Asia, and Australia. They produce small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. The leaves are usually simple and opposite, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface."
