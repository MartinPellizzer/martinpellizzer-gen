    "intro": "Orobanche epithymum var. bushei, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or reddish stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pink in color. It is often found in Mediterranean regions and thrives in dry, disturbed soils. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on agricultural crops."
