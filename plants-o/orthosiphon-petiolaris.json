    "intro": "Orthosiphon petiolaris, commonly known as the slender horse-gram, is a member of the Lamiaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, arranged in whorled clusters. Its aromatic leaves and flowering stems are used in traditional medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. Orthosiphon petiolaris thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas in its natural habitat."
