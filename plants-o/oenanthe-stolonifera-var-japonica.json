    "intro": "Oenanthe stolonifera var. japonica, commonly known as Japanese water dropwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It features slender, upright stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread via stolons. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately lobed, and often have a mild, somewhat spicy odor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes considered invasive in non-native regions."
