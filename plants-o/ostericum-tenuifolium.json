    "intro": "Ostericum tenuifolium, commonly known as slender-leaved ostericum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter wide, arranged in dense, mat-like formations. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Ostericum tenuifolium is often used in alpine gardens for its hardiness and ornamental value."
