    "intro": "Oncidium filamentosum, commonly known as the Filamentous Oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features pendant, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, filament-like hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with a distinctive, elongated lip that is often adorned with intricate patterns. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Oncidium filamentosum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ease of care and long-lasting blooms."
