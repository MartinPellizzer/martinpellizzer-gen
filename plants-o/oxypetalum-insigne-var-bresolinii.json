    "intro": "Oxypetalum insigne var. bresolinii, commonly known as the Bresolin's oxypetalum, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a subtle fragrance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a glossy surface and serrated edges. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
