    "intro": "Ozothamnus obcordatus subsp. obcordatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved everlasting, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to southern Australia. It features aromatic, silver-gray foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in dense, cylindrical clusters during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant once established. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native gardens and for erosion control."
