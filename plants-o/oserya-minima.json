    "intro": "Oserya minima, commonly known as the dwarf oserya, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense, glossy green leaves that are oval in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers during the summer months, which are followed by bright red berries. Oserya minima thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to tolerate salt spray and coastal winds."
