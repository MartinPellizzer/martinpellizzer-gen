    "intro": "Opuntia galapageia subvar. prolifera, commonly known as the Gal\u00e1pagos prickly pear, is a cactus native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its stems often branch out and form dense clusters, which help it thrive in the arid environment. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem, providing food for various native animals."
