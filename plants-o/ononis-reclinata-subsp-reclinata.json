    "intro": "Ononis reclinata subsp. reclinata, commonly known as the creeping everlasting, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features wiry stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky and sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, followed by fluffy, white seed heads. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is often found in disturbed habitats and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
