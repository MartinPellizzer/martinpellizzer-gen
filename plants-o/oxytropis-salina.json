    "intro": "Oxytropis salina, commonly known as saltbush, is a flowering plant native to arid and saline environments. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to high-salt conditions, making it a common species in coastal and desert regions. Its leaves are often small and hairy, reducing water loss in harsh climates. Oxytropis salina plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for livestock in saline areas."
