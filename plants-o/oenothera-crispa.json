    "intro": "Oenothera crispa, commonly known as the curly willow or sea willow, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and clusters of yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. Oenothera crispa is often found in sandy or dune habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
