    "intro": "Oxytropis trautvetteri, commonly known as the Trautvetter's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, often at high elevations. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately compound, consisting of several small leaflets, and the plant has a deep root system adapted to arid conditions. Oxytropis trautvetteri is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
