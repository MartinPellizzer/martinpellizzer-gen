    "intro": "Ornithogalum tenuifolium subsp. trichophyllum, commonly known as the woolly cowslip, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves that give it its subspecies name, *trichophyllum*, meaning \"hairy.\" The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. This species is often found in rocky or sandy habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
