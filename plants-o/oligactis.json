    "intro": "Oligactis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, often in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a unique structure with a single, slender stem and a single, showy white or pale green flower. It is known for its lack of leaves, relying instead on its stem for photosynthesis. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, Oligactis is considered critically endangered."
