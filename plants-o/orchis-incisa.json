    "intro": "Orchis incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, showy spike of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers, which are often tinged with purple. Orchis incisa typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
