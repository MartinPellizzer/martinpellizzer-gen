    "intro": "Onobrychis pindicola, commonly known as the Pindus clover, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Greece and the Balkans. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in early summer. The plant is well adapted to rocky and dry habitats, often growing in alpine and subalpine environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria. The species is of interest in ecological studies and has potential uses in forage and conservation efforts."
