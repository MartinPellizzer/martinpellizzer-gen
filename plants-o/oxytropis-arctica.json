    "intro": "Oxytropis arctica, commonly known as Arctic locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor, cold environments. Its leaves are typically small and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Oxytropis arctica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for certain herbivores in its ecosystem."
