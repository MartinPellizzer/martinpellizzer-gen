    "intro": "Odontotrichum multilobum, commonly known as the multilobed toothed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant features slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikes and bloom in early summer. Odontotrichum multilobum is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators in its native environment."
