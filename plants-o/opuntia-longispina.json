    "intro": "Opuntia longispina, commonly known as the long-spined prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible fruits that are often used in local cuisines. Opuntia longispina is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its succulent stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently. Its ecological importance includes providing food and shelter for various desert wildlife species."
