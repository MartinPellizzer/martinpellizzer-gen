    "intro": "Orchis foliacea, commonly known as the leafy orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a rosette at the base. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers in late spring, which are clustered in a spike at the top of the stem. Orchis foliacea is a perennial herb that thrives in moist, woodland habitats. Its morphology reflects adaptations to its natural environment, making it a distinctive member of the Orchidaceae family."
