    "intro": "Onixotis triquetra, commonly known as the three-lobed orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, triangular-shaped leaves and produces intricate, fragrant flowers with a unique triquetrous (three-cornered) structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Its botanical significance lies in its specialized adaptations to its habitat and its role in local ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
