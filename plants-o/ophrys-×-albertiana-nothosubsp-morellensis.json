    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 albertiana nothosubsp. morellensis, commonly known as the Morell\u2019s bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its distinctive bee-like flower structure, which features a specialized lip mimicking the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. This nothosubspecies is a result of natural hybridization between Ophrys albertiana and Ophrys apifera, showcasing the diversity within the Ophrys genus."
