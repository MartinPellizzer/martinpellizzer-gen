    "intro": "Ottelia acuminata var. tonhaiensis, commonly known as the Tonhai water starwort, is a semi-aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and they are usually small and clustered near the water surface. Ottelia acuminata var. tonhaiensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
