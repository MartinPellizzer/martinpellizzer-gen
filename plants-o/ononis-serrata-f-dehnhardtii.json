    "intro": "Ononis serrata f. dehnhardtii, commonly known as the serrated rockcress, is a rare and distinctive plant species belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, toothed leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. This subspecies is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or arctic environments. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant is notable for its ecological significance in supporting pollinators in its native habitats."
