    "intro": "Oxypetalum joergensenii, commonly known as the J\u00f6rgensen's oxypetalum, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with five petals that are slightly curved at the tips. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oxypetalum joergensenii is considered a species of conservation concern."
