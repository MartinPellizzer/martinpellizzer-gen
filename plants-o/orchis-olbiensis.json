    "intro": "Orchis olbiensis, commonly known as the Olbiense Orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in forested or semi-shrubland habitats. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it plays a significant role in local biodiversity. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
