    "intro": "Ochrosia hexandra, commonly known as the waxflower or golden waxplant, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring broad, leathery leaves that are dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature and subtle scent. Ochrosia hexandra is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
