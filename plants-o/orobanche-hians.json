    "intro": "Orobanche hians, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short, tubular stem with no true leaves. It often infests crops such as wheat and barley, causing significant agricultural damage. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its habitat."
