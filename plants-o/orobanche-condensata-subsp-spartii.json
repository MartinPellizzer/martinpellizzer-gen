    "intro": "Orobanche condensata subsp. spartii, commonly known as the desert broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to thrive in harsh environments by forming specialized haustoria to attach to host roots. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
