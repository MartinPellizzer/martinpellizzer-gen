    "intro": "Ophiopogon ogisui, commonly known as the Japanese forest grass, is a perennial flowering plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Ophiopogon ogisui is valued for its evergreen foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
