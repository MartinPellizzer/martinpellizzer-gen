    "intro": "Ophrys apifera var. jurana, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its striking flower structure that closely resembles a bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heaths. Its flowers are usually yellow with a dark brown or black pattern, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. The orchid is a perennial herb with a short, stout stem and broad, lance-shaped leaves."
