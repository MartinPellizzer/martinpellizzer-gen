    "intro": "Oxalis oligosperma, commonly known as the small-leaf wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves with three heart-shaped leaflets, often adorned with fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical name reflects its limited seed production, a characteristic that influences its reproductive strategy."
