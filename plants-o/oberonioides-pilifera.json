It is characterized by its distinctive hairy leaves and delicate, often fragrant flowers that bloom in a variety of colors. Native to certain regions of South America, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
