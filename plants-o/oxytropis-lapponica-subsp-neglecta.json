    "intro": "Oxytropis lapponica subsp. neglecta, commonly known as the Lapland milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and cylindrical, woody pods that contain small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its botanical features make it an important component of tundra and mountain ecosystems."
