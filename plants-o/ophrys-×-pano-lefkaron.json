    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 pano-lefkaron, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys fucata. It is a terrestrial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula, characterized by its distinctive floral morphology that mimics female bees to attract male pollinators. The plant produces a single upright stem with a few leaves and a terminal inflorescence of showy, bee-like flowers. Its botanical features include a complex structure with a labellum that resembles a bee's abdomen, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. This orchid is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky areas."
