It is a small shrub that typically grows in coastal areas, particularly in mangrove ecosystems. The plant is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. It has specialized root systems that help it survive in brackish water environments. Ophiorrhiza longicornis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
