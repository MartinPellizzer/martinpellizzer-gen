    "intro": "Orobanche tinctoria, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found growing on the roots of various agricultural crops such as wheat and barley. The plant is notable for its ability to cause significant yield losses in crops due to its parasitic nature. Its seeds can remain viable in the soil for many years, making it a persistent weed in farmlands. Despite its negative impact on agriculture, it has been historically used in traditional medicine and dye production."
