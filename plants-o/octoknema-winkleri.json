It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes many aromatic and medicinal plants. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
