    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza humilis, commonly known as the dwarf mangrove, is a small, shrub-like plant that thrives in coastal and brackish water environments. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish coating. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that contain a single seed. Ophiorrhiza humilis is typically found in intertidal zones and is adapted to tolerate saltwater conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important species in mangrove ecosystems."
