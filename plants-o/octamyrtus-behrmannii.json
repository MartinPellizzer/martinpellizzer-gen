    "intro": "Octamyrtus behrmannii, commonly known as the Behrmann\u2019s octamyrtus, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the eastern regions of Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal heathlands and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. It produces woody capsules that contain small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
