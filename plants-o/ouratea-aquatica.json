    "intro": "Ouratea aquatica, commonly known as water ouratea, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands and marshes of South America. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. Its root system is adapted to waterlogged soils, allowing it to thrive in swampy environments. The species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
