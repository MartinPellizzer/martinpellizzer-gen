It typically grows in moist, temperate regions and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. The plant features finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and glossy, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Its small white to pale yellow flowers appear in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its delicate structure and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated for both aesthetic and herbal purposes."
