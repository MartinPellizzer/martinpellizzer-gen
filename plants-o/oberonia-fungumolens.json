    "intro": "Oberonia fungumolens, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact, pseudobulbous structure with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and decaying organic matter in its habitat. Oberonia fungumolens thrives in high humidity and partial shade, making it a popular choice for greenhouse cultivation."
