    "intro": "Ochradiscus major, commonly known as the giant waterwheel plant, is a unique aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant has a distinctive whorl of long, thin leaves radiating from a central stem, giving it a wheel-like appearance. Its roots are anchored in the substrate, while the floating leaves help in photosynthesis. Ochradiscus major is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats."
