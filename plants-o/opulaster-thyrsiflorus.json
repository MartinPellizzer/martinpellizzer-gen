    "intro": "Opulaster thyrsiflorus, commonly known as the mountain thorn, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has adapted to harsh environments through its deep root system and waxy leaf surface, which reduce water loss. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, playing a role in local ecosystems. Opulaster thyrsiflorus is also valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in ornamental gardening."
