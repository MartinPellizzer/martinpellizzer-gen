    "intro": "Ornithogalum namaquanum, commonly known as the Namibian star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Namibia and South Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, sometimes branching stems and clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, storing water to reduce transpiration. Ornithogalum namaquanum is also noted for its ability to thrive in poor soils, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
