    "intro": "Oncocarpus, commonly known as the \"sac fungus,\" is a genus of fungi belonging to the family Onygenaceae. These fungi are notable for their unique reproductive structures called oncomata, which are sac-like bodies that contain the spores. Oncocarpus species are typically found in soil and on decaying organic matter, where they play a role in decomposition. They are not parasitic but can sometimes be associated with plants as saprophytes. The genus is of interest in mycology due to its distinctive morphology and ecological significance."
