    "intro": "Ophrys fuciflora subsp. andria, commonly known as the Andria bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female wasps to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open habitats such as cliffs or woodland edges. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range."
