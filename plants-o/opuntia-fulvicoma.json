    "intro": "Opuntia fulvicoma, commonly known as the yellow spine cactus, is a species native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its flat, paddle-like stems called cladodes. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by fruit that is typically red or orange. Opuntia fulvicoma is adapted to arid environments and has spines that help protect it from herbivores and reduce water loss. Its structure and adaptations make it well-suited for survival in dry, hot climates."
