    "intro": "Opuntia glomerata var. calva, commonly known as the woolly prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense clusters of cylindrical, spiny stems that are often covered in a white, waxy coating. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems for survival in arid environments. This variety is well adapted to hot, dry climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
