    "intro": "Opuntia lagopus var. leucolagopus, commonly known as the White-Flowered Prickly Pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces large, showy white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and contains a sweet, pulpy interior. This variety is adapted to arid environments and thrives in full sun with well-draining soil."
