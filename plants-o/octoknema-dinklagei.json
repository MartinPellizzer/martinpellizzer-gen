    "intro": "Octoknema dinklagei, commonly known as the Dinklage's octoknema, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits containing single seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
