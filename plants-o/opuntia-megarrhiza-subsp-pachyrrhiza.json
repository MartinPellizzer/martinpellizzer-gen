    "intro": "Opuntia megarrhiza subsp. pachyrrhiza, commonly known as the thick-ribbed prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces large, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red, typically blooming in the summer months. Its pads are fleshy and water-storing, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. This subspecies is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in scrublands and dry forests."
