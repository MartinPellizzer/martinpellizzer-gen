    "intro": "Olax wightiana var. nigrescens, commonly known as the black-leaved olax, is a shrub native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its dark green, almost black, foliage that becomes more pronounced with age. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers during the summer months, followed by elliptical, winged fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
