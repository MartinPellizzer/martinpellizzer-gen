It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems known as cladodes, which are covered in spines and are used for photosynthesis. The plant produces vibrant yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit, called a tunas, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. Opuntia ianthinantha is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert regions."
