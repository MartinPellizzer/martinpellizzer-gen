It features small, rounded, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or rocky habitats. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a resilient species in challenging environments."
