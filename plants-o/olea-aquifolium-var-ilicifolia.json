    "intro": "Olea aquifolium var. ilicifolia, commonly known as the Persian ironwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dark, glossy, elliptical leaves that are often adorned with spiny margins, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, black drupes that are rich in oils. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes in regions with warm, dry climates."
