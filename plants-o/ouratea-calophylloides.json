    "intro": "Ouratea calophylloides, commonly known as the Brazilian beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its showy, clustered purple berries that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with opposite, elliptic leaves that are glossy and dark green. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The berries, while attractive, are not typically consumed by humans due to their bitter taste and potential toxicity."
