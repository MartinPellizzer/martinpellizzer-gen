    "intro": "Oncidium pachyphyllum, commonly known as the fat lip orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to drier environments. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-green flowers with prominent lip petals. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive. Oncidium pachyphyllum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
