    "intro": "Oberonia irrorata, commonly known as the silver-streaked orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which are distinctive for their intricate, spurred petals. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
