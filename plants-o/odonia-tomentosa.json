    "intro": "Odonia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly odonia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a woolly appearance, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, often covered in a fine layer of white trichomes. Odonia tomentosa is adapted to grow in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
