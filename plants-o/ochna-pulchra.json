    "intro": "Ochna pulchra, commonly known as the red-barked tree or red bark tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a glossy upper surface and a pale underside. Ochna pulchra is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
