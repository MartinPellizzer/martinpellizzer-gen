It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it bears dark purple to black berries as its fruit. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments within lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
