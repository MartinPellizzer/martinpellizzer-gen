    "intro": "Orobanche cooperi subsp. cooperi, commonly known as the Indian pipe, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its pale, often translucent stem and small, inconspicuous flowers. This species typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and woodlands. Its unique morphology and parasitic lifestyle make it an interesting subject in botanical studies. The plant is also noted for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils due to its specialized relationship with host plants."
