    "intro": "Ononis aphylla var. erioclada, commonly known as the woolly sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its gray-green, densely hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are typically prostrate or ascending, forming dense mats that stabilize sandy soils. This variety is well adapted to coastal and inland desert regions, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils."
