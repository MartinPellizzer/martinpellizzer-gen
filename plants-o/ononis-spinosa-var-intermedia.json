    "intro": "Ononis spinosa var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate sand-verbena, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variant is considered a subspecies of Ononis spinosa and is adapted to thrive in harsh, drought-prone conditions."
