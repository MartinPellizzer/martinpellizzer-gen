    "intro": "Orchis tridentata var. hanrii, commonly known as the Hanrii three-lobed orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive three-lobed flowers, which are typically pink or purple in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
