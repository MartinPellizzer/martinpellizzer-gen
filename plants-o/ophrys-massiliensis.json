    "intro": "Ophrys massiliensis, commonly known as the Massilian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded habitats. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and often have intricate patterns that enhance their mimicry. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophrys massiliensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
