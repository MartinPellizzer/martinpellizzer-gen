    "intro": "Opuntia inaperta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems and clusters of small, spine-tipped leaves. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, spherical fruits known as tunas. Opuntia inaperta is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its structure and growth habits make it a resilient and drought-tolerant plant."
