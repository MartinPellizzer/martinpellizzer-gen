    "intro": "Orchis morio var. irregularis, commonly known as the irregular orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a prominent, spurred lip that distinguishes it from other orchid varieties. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variant is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
