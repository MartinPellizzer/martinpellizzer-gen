    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 neoschulzei, commonly known as the Schultze's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral structure, which includes a specialized lip that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats with well-drained soil, often found in Mediterranean climates. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy. Ophrys \u00d7 neoschulzei is a short-lived perennial, often appearing as a rosette of leaves before producing its showy inflorescence."
