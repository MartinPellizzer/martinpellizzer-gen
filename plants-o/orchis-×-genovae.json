    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 genovae, commonly known as the Genovese twayblade, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis anthropophora. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, erect stem bearing a spike of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is found in parts of Europe, including Italy and France. It has a fibrous root system and produces a capsule as its fruit, containing numerous minute seeds. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it an interesting subject for botanical study."
