    "intro": "Ophrys macedonica, commonly known as the Macedonian bee orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the mountainous regions of North Macedonia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy that aids in pollination by male bees. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and limestone areas. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Ophrys macedonica plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is a subject of conservation interest due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss."
