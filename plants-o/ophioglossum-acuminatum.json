    "intro": "Ophioglossum acuminatum, commonly known as the spurred adder's-tongue, is a rare and ancient fern belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique, spurred spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are located on the underside of its fertile leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, preferring rich, organic soil. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a prominent midrib and are often divided into two distinct parts. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Ophioglossum acuminatum is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
