    "intro": "Ophrys minuscula, commonly known as the small bee orchid, is a small terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bee-like flower that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually pale green to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its mimicry. Ophrys minuscula is a rare and protected species, often found in specific microhabitats with particular soil and climate conditions."
