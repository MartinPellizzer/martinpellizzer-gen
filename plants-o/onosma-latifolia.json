    "intro": "Onosma latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf onosma, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Central Asia. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family, characterized by its hairy stems and showy blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. Onosma latifolia is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive appearance and resilience to poor soil conditions."
