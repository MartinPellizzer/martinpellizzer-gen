    "intro": "Onopordum illyricum subsp. euillyricum, commonly known as the Illyrian thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and large, yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. The subspecies euillyricum is distinguished by its more compact growth form compared to other subspecies of Onopordum illyricum."
