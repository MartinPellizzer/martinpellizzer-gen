    "intro": "Onobrychis cornuta, commonly known as the horned vetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a legume, belonging to the Fabaceae family, and is characterized by its distinctive, hooked pods. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Its small, pea-like flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces a profusion of seeds that are dispersed by wind. Onobrychis cornuta is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
