    "intro": "Ophrys thesei, commonly known as the Greek bee orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to southern Europe. It is a terrestrial herb with a tall, unbranched stem that bears a single, showy flower. The flower has a distinctive appearance, resembling a bee with its yellow and brown markings, which is a key adaptation for attracting pollinators. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open woodlands. Its specialized floral structure is designed to mimic the appearance and scent of female bees, facilitating pseudocopulation for pollination."
