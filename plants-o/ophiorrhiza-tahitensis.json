    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza tahitensis, commonly known as the Tahitian orchid or Tahitian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, including Tahiti and other islands in French Polynesia. The plant has small, simple leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that are often white or pale yellow. It relies on other plants for some of its nutrients, making it a partial parasite. Ophiorrhiza tahitensis is typically found growing on the branches of trees in humid, shaded environments."
