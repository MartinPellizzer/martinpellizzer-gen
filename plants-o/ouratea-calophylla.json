It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that often have a purplish tinge, especially in shaded areas. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
