    "intro": "Orobus glaberrimus, commonly known as the smooth orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered blooms that are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Orobus glaberrimus is considered a rare and endangered species."
