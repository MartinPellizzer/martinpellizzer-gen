    "intro": "Orchis mediterranea subsp. georgica, commonly known as the Georgian orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant has a complex root system and produces a single, spurred flower per stem, which is a typical feature of the Orchidaceae family. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in rocky or open habitats. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its specific ecological requirements and limited distribution."
