    "intro": "Ophrys insectifera var. elongata, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, with a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange with a dark brown or black pattern, and it produces small, greenish-black seed pods after flowering. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens."
