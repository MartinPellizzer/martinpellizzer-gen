    "intro": "Oxalis sepium var. prolongata, commonly known as the elongated wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped lobes and small, delicate flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its stems are often elongated and trailing, allowing it to spread across the ground. Oxalis sepium var. prolongata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage and floral display."
