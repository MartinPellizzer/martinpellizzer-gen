    "intro": "Ophrys friburgensis, commonly known as the Fribourg bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of central Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy flower with intricate patterns and a specialized labellum that enhances its mimicry. It thrives in nutrient-poor, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
