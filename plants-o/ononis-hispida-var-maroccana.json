    "intro": "Ononis hispida var. maroccana, commonly known as the Moroccan sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of North Africa. It features small, hairy stems and produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, stiff hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
