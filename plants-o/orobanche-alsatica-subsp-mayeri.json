    "intro": "Orobanche alsatica subsp. mayeri, commonly known as the pale barrenweed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing members of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pale green or yellow in color. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by its host roots. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
