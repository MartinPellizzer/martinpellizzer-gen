    "intro": "Ononis tridentata var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf sandspurry, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are broader than those of the typical species, and its yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variant is notable for its adaptability and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
