    "intro": "Opuntia fragilis var. frutescens, commonly known as the brittle prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, segmented stems that are often covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soil conditions and high temperatures. Its structure and growth habits make it well-suited for xeriscaping and desert landscapes."
