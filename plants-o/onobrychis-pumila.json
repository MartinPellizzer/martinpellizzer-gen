    "intro": "Onobrychis pumila, commonly known as the dwarf burclover, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, cylindrical seed pods. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rocky or arid environments. Onobrychis pumila plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
