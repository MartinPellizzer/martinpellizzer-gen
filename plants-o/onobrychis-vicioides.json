It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Onobrychis vicioides is also used in forage and as a cover crop due to its hardy nature and ecological benefits."
