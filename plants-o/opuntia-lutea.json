    "intro": "Opuntia lutea, commonly known as the yellow prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which are tiny, barbed hairs that can cause irritation. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia lutea is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It plays an important role in desert ecosystems and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
