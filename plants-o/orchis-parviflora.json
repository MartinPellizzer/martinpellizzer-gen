    "intro": "Orchis parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered orchid, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces a single, slender flowering stem. Its flowers are usually pale pink to white, with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. Orchis parviflora is characterized by its specialized orchid structure, including a column and pollinia, which are adaptations for its specific pollination mechanisms."
