    "intro": "Orthosia aphylla, commonly known as the leafless orthosia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with only small, scale-like structures present. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
