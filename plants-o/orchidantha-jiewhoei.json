    "intro": "Orchidantha jiewhoei, commonly known as the Jiewhoei orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near the forest floor or on rocky outcrops. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Orchidantha jiewhoei is considered a conservation concern."
