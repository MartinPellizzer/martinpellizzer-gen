    "intro": "Ononis irritabilis f. ulcina, commonly known as the rough everlasting or sand everlasting, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe. It features wiry, branched stems that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a rough, sandpaper-like texture. This subspecies is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems and a high tolerance for drought and poor soil conditions."
