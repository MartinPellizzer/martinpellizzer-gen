    "intro": "Ophelia gracilis, commonly known as slender water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and ditches. The plant features delicate, floating leaves that are broadly arrowhead-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, which bloom in early summer. Ophelia gracilis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and stabilizing waterbed sediments."
