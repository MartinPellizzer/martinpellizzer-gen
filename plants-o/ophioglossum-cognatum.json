    "intro": "Ophioglossum cognatum, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often twisted fronds that resemble a bird's nest, giving it its common name. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecological health."
