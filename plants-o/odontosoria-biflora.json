    "intro": "Odontosoria biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered tooth fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its intricate fronds that are divided into numerous small, serrated pinnae. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Odontosoria biflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in horticultural collections."
