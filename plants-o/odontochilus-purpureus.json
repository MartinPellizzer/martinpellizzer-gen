    "intro": "Odontochilus purpureus, commonly known as the purple-stemmed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces striking purple or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a vibrant touch to its natural habitat. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
