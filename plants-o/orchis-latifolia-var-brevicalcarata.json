    "intro": "Orchis latifolia var. brevicalcarata, commonly known as the broad-leaved orchid variant with short spur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and showy, purple or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Its flowers have a distinctive spur that is shorter than the standard form of the species, a key feature distinguishing this variant. It plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native ecosystems."
