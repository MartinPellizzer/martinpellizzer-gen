    "intro": "Olea europaea var. alba, commonly known as the white olive, is a variety of the olive tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its pale green to white leaves, which distinguish it from the more common green-leafed olive varieties. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, edible fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, temperate climate. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes as well as for its mild-flavored olives."
