    "intro": "Ornithostaphylos, commonly known as the bird's-foot trefoil, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which resemble a bird's foot, and its yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring. These plants are typically found in dry, rocky habitats across western North America. Ornithostaphylos species are often used in landscaping for their drought tolerance and ornamental value. They also play a role in soil stabilization and can be part of native plant restoration efforts."
