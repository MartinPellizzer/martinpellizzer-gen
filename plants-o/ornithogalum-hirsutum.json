    "intro": "Ornithogalum hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy star-of-Bethlehem, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers with a slight greenish tinge. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its bulbs are toxic and should be handled with care. Ornithogalum hirsutum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in temperate climates."
