    "intro": "Orobanche sanguinea, commonly known as the red broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, reddish-brown flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system consists of haustoria, specialized structures that penetrate the roots of its host to extract water and nutrients. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host plants."
