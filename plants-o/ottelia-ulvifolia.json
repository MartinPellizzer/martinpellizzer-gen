    "intro": "Ottelia ulvifolia, commonly known as water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has broad, waxy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern on the water surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Ottelia ulvifolia is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its rapid growth makes it both a useful water purifier and a potential invasive species in non-native environments."
