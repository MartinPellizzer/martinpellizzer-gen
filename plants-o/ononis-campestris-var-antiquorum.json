    "intro": "Ononis campestris var. antiquorum, commonly known as ancient field bean, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of many leguminous species. This variety is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which can remain viable in the soil for several years. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility in agricultural settings."
