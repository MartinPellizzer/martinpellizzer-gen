    "intro": "Orchis rotundifolia f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its elongated, grass-like leaves and dense, spiraled inflorescence. It produces small, greenish or pale yellow flowers arranged in a loose spike, typical of the Orchidaceae family. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows, often in areas with rich, humusy soil. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The species is notable for its ability to hybridize with other orchid species, contributing to its ecological and botanical significance."
