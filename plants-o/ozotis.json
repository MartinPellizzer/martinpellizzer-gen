    "intro": "Ozotis, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Boraginaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries like Namibia and South Africa. Ozotis species are characterized by their striking blue or violet flowers, which are often clustered in terminal spikes. They are drought-tolerant and have adapted to thrive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss."
