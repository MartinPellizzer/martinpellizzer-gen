    "intro": "Ornithopteris portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican holly fern, is a species of fern native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds with a distinctive, wavy margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
