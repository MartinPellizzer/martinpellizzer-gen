    "intro": "Oryzopsis rigida, commonly known as rigid grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, stiff leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its flowering spikes are usually slender and spike-like, with small, wind-pollinated flowers. Oryzopsis rigida is often used in native plant landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
