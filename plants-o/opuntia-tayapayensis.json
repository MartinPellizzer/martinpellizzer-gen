    "intro": "Opuntia tayapayensis, commonly known as the Tayapayensis prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its flat, fleshy stem segments called cladodes. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. It is adapted to arid environments and has a shallow root system to efficiently absorb water. Opuntia tayapayensis is also noted for its spines, which provide protection against herbivores."
