    "intro": "Orchis sulphurea var. markusii, commonly known as the sulphur orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and orange flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Its flowers are adorned with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
