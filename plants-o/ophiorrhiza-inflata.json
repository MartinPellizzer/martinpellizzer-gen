    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza inflata, commonly known as the inflated mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Asia, including India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its succulent, inflated leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. It attaches to host trees via haustoria, drawing nutrients and water from its host. Ophiorrhiza inflata is often found in disturbed habitats and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
