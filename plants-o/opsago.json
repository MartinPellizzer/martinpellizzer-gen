It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. The plant produces berries that are toxic to humans and animals, containing cardiac glycosides. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks.
