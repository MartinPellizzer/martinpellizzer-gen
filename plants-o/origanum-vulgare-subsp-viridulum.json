It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green. The plant produces compact clusters of small, pale blue to violet flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or herb gardens. Its aromatic leaves are used in cooking and traditional medicine, similar to other members of the mint family."
