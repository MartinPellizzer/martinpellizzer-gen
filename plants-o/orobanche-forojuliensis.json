    "intro": "Orobanche forojuliensis, commonly known as the Italian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its distinctive, often showy flowers. This species typically infests crops such as wheat and barley, causing significant yield losses. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots. Due to its parasitic nature, it poses challenges for agricultural management and control."
