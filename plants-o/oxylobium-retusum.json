    "intro": "Oxylobium retusum, commonly known as the smoothleaf oxylobium, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring. Its flowering stems are typically slender and branched, adding to its ornamental appeal. Oxylobium retusum is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in chaparral and desert scrub environments."
