    "intro": "Ophioglossum scariosum, commonly known as the broad-leaved adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically located on the underside of the leaf. Ophioglossum scariosum is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in many regions."
