    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered mangrove, is a shrub native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is typically found in brackish water environments. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are dry capsules that release tiny seeds into the water, aiding in its dispersal. Ophiorrhiza micrantha plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local biodiversity."
