    "intro": "Ornithogalum exscapum var. biflorum, commonly known as the two-flowered star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers on slender stems. The plant is characterized by its bulbous root system, which stores nutrients and allows it to survive in dry conditions. It typically blooms in late winter to early spring, making it a notable early-flowering species. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has some traditional medicinal uses."
