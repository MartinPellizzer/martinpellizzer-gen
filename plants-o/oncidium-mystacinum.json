It is characterized by its elegant, pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of yellow and green flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and help store water and nutrients. Oncidium mystacinum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
