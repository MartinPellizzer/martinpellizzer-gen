    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 kohlmuellerorum, commonly known as the Kohlmueller's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species that exhibits unique botanical characteristics. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid). The plant is known for its intricate floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of an insect to attract pollinators. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland areas, and prefers well-drained soil. Its flowers are usually yellow or brown, with a distinct three-lobed structure that enhances its mimicry of insect forms."
