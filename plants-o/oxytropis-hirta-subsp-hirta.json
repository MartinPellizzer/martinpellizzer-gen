    "intro": "Oxytropis hirta subsp. hirta, commonly known as hairy locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and mountainous regions. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions and is often found in disturbed or open areas. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense pubescence and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil."
