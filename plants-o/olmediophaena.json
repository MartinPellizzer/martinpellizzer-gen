    "intro": "Olmediophaena, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its delicate nature and habitat specificity, Olmediophaena is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many regions."
