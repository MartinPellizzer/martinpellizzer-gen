    "intro": "Ononis repens subsp. caduca, commonly known as the brittle restharrow, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by fluffy, seed-bearing heads. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and hairy, adapted to thrive in dry, sandy or rocky soils. This species is often found in disturbed habitats and is valued for its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
