    "intro": "Ononis antiquorum, commonly known as the ancient sandwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or arid environments. The plant features small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss. Ononis antiquorum is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
