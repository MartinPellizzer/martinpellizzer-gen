    "intro": "Oncostylis, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the Malvaceae family. These plants are native to various regions in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, often found in coastal areas and tropical environments. Oncostylis species typically have showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from yellow to red, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. The leaves are usually simple, alternate, and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The fruit is a capsule that contains numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind or water."
