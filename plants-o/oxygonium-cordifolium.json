    "intro": "Oxygonium cordifolium, commonly known as the heart-leaf water plant, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often used in ornamental ponds. Its rapid growth makes it both a useful water purifier and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats."
