    "intro": "Ornithogalum minimum var. bulbiferum, commonly known as the bulbous star-of-Bethlehem, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of star-shaped, white or pale blue flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its underground bulb, which serves as a storage organ and enables it to survive periods of drought. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or container planting. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is often grown in gardens for its delicate appearance."
