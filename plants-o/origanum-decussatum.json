    "intro": "Origanum decussatum, commonly known as mountain savory, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or alpine gardens. Its leaves are often used in culinary and medicinal applications due to their pungent, slightly bitter flavor. Origanum decussatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract beneficial insects."
