    "intro": "Onobrychis megataphros subsp. major, commonly known as the large-flowered burclover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces cylindrical, spiny pods that contain small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
