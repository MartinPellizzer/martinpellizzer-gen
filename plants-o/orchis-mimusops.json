    "intro": "Orchis mimusops, commonly known as the showy orchis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces striking, violet-blue flowers that are clustered in a loose raceme, with a distinctive lip petal that aids in pollination. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, and it thrives in moist, woodland habitats. Orchis mimusops plays an important ecological role by supporting various pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
