    "intro": "Ononis angustissima subsp. longifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically features slender, branching stems covered in small, glandular hairs. The leaves are linear to lanceolate, often with a bluish-gray appearance due to the dense pubescence. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in racemes, which bloom in early summer. This species is adapted to dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges."
