    "intro": "Oligochaetochilus xerophilus, commonly known as the dryland moss, is a rare and specialized member of the moss family. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in arid environments, showcasing adaptations such as thick, waxy leaf surfaces to reduce water loss. The plant forms dense, cushion-like growths that help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. Its reproductive structures, including capsules, are typically found on short, upright stalks. Despite its resilience, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it an indicator species for dryland ecosystems."
