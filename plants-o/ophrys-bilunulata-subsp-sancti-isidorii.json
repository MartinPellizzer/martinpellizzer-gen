    "intro": "Ophrys bilunulata subsp. sancti-isidorii, commonly known as the San Isidore Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a complex lip that mimics the appearance of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils within Mediterranean woodlands and shrublands. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing showy, greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes."
