    "intro": "Oxydectes corrientesiana, commonly known as the Corrientes orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Uruguay. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and green, often clustered in racemes. It thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
