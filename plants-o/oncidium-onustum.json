    "intro": "Oncidium onustum, commonly known as the yellow oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescence that bears numerous fragrant, yellow flowers with a distinctive dark throat. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Oncidium onustum is valued in horticulture for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
