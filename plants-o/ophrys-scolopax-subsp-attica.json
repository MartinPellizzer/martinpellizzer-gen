    "intro": "Ophrys scolopax subsp. attica, commonly known as the Attic bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this subspecies is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
