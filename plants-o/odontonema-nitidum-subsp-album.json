    "intro": "Odontonema nitidum subsp. album, commonly known as the white-flowered odontonema, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a shrub characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months, adding a delicate floral display. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements. The subspecies is distinguished by its pale, almost white flowers, which set it apart from other varieties within the Odontonema genus."
