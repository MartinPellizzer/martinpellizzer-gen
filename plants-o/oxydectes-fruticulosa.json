    "intro": "Oxydectes fruticulosa, commonly known as the red-flowered oxeye, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with woody stems that become more pronounced with age. The plant produces clusters of bright orange to red flowers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Oxydectes fruticulosa is well adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
