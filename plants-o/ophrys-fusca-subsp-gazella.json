    "intro": "Ophrys fusca subsp. gazella, commonly known as the gazelle orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flowers that feature a dark brown to blackish coloration with intricate patterns mimicking the appearance of a female bee. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are specialized for mimicry, attracting male bees for pollination through a deceptive mating behavior. The species is relatively rare and is considered a priority for conservation due to habitat loss and fragmentation."
