It is a perennial herb with distinctive heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, five-petaled flowers. The plant produces red or orange flowers that bloom in spring and summer, often followed by red or orange berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens. Its ornamental value and ability to spread through runners make it both a decorative and sometimes invasive species."
