    "intro": "Oberonia oblonga, commonly known as the broad-leafed Oberonia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with a rhizome and multiple pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip that is often marked with purple or brown spots. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Oberonia oblonga thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in lowland forests."
