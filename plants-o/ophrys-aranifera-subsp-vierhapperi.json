    "intro": "Ophrys aranifera subsp. vierhapperi, commonly known as the Vierhapper's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a pouch-like structure called a labellum, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
