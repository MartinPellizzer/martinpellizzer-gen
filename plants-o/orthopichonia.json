    "intro": "Orthopichonia, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often colorful flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. The plants typically grow in rocky or calcareous soils, often in mountainous regions, and are adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Orthopichonia species are known for their unique floral structures, which include specialized petals and sepals that aid in pollination by specific insect species. These plants are of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to their ecological significance and ornamental value."
