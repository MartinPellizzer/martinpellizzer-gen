    "intro": "Ortholoma sanguinolentum, commonly known as the bloodroot plant, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its striking red-orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and produces a single, erect stem that bears the showy inflorescence. Its name derives from the reddish color of its sap, which can be toxic if ingested. Ortholoma sanguinolentum is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
