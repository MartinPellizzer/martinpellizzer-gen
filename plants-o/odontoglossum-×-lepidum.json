    "intro": "Odontoglossum \u00d7 lepidum, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a naturally occurring cross between Odontoglossum and Lepidium, though Lepidium is not an orchid, suggesting a possible taxonomic confusion. It is a herbaceous plant native to the Andes, where it thrives in cool, humid environments. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in a range of colors, including white, pink, and purple, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are typically broad and grass-like, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a variety of morphological traits that can vary significantly between individuals."
