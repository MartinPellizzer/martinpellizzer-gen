    "intro": "Oplismenus spectabilis, commonly known as the silver sword, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features a rosette of broad, silver-tomentose leaves that are often described as resembling a sword, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in loose panicles. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, sandy soils. Oplismenus spectabilis is often used in ornamental gardening for its striking foliage and ease of cultivation."
