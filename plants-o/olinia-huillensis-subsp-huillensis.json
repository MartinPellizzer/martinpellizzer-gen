    "intro": "Olinia huillensis subsp. huillensis, commonly known as the Huill\u00e9n mountain heath, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
