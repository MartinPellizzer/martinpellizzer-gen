    "intro": "Ophrys bombyliflora var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heaths. Its flowers are small and yellowish-green, with a distinctive lip that resembles a bee's body. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
