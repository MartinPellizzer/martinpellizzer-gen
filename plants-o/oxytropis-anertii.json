    "intro": "Oxytropis anertii, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of western North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in desert or semi-desert environments. The plant produces small, yellow or greenish flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the plant is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Oxytropis anertii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
