    "intro": "Odontophyllum lyratum, commonly known as the lyreleaf sedge, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and typically grows in wetland or marshy environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in waterlogged soils. Odontophyllum lyratum is often used in traditional medicine and can also serve as a habitat for various aquatic organisms."
