    "intro": "Olearia stricta subsp. stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf ice plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to New Zealand. It features small, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like white or pale yellow flowers during late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
