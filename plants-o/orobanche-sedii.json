    "intro": "Orobanche sedii, commonly known as the pale broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically parasitizes a variety of herbaceous plants, including those in the legume family. Its life cycle involves germinating near the roots of a host plant and establishing a connection through specialized structures called haustoria. Orobanche sedii is often found in disturbed soils and can be a problematic weed in agricultural settings."
