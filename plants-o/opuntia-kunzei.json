    "intro": "Opuntia kunzei, commonly known as the yellow prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in sharp spines and woolly areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia kunzei is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its structure and adaptations make it well-suited for survival in harsh desert conditions."
