It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veinal pattern and produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in umbels. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and riverbanks. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to oxalic acid content. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
