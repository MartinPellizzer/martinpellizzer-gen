    "intro": "Ochna glaucescens, commonly known as the blue ochna, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small to medium-sized shrub characterized by its smooth, often glaucous (bluish-gray) bark and elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by orange-red berries. Ochna glaucescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to a variety of garden settings."
