    "intro": "Ottelia, commonly known as water buttercup, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Onagraceae. It is characterized by its floating leaves and yellow flowers that bloom above the water surface. The leaves are typically rounded with a waxy coating, aiding in buoyancy and water repellence. Ottelia species are often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. These plants play a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
