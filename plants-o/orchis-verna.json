    "intro": "Orchis verna, commonly known as the early purple orchid, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. The plant produces striking violet or purple flowers with a distinct three-lobed lip, which is a characteristic feature of the Orchidaceae family. Its flowering period occurs in early spring, making it one of the first orchids to bloom. The plant has a tuberous root system and is often used in traditional herbal medicine."
