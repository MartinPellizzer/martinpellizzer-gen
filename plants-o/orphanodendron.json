    "intro": "Orphanodendron, commonly known as the ghost tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its unique, often spirally arranged leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Orphanodendron species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant."
