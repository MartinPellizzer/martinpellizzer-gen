It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. Oxytropis defilippii is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
