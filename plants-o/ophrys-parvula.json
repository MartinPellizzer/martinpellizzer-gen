    "intro": "Ophrys parvula, commonly known as the small bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are small, usually less than 2 centimeters in length, and feature intricate patterns that aid in attracting male bees. Ophrys parvula is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, often with a single or two lateral flowers."
