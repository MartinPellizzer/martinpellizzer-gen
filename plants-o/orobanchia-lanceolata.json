    "intro": "Orobanchia lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It attaches to the roots of host plants, primarily grasses, to derive nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short, erect stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats across Europe and parts of Asia. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, making it an important study subject in parasitic plant ecology."
