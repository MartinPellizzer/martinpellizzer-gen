    "intro": "Orchis maculata var. kortiathica, commonly known as the Kortiathica spotted orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive spotted leaves and flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. Its flowers are usually pink or purple with a yellowish-green throat, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered endangered in many areas."
