    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 cranbrookeana, commonly known as the Cranbrooke orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the British Isles. It belongs to the genus Ophrys, which is characterized by its intricate, bee-mimicking flowers that facilitate pollination through pseudocopulation. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and heathlands. Its flowers are notable for their complex structure, with a labellum that closely resembles a female bee to attract male pollinators. This hybrid exhibits a combination of traits from its parent species, Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera, resulting in a unique botanical form."
