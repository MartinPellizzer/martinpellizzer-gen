    "intro": "Othonna undulata, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features narrow, fleshy leaves that are often wavy or undulating, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique leaf morphology and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
