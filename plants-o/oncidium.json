    "intro": "Oncidium, commonly known as the butterfly orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. Oncidium species are known for their long-lasting, showy flowers that often resemble butterflies, hence their common name. They typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks. Oncidiums require bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive, making them popular among orchid enthusiasts."
