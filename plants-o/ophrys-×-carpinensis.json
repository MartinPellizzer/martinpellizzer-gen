    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 carpinensis, commonly known as the Carpinus orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is characterized by its unique flower structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in woodland habitats, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually yellowish-brown with intricate patterns that aid in mimicry. Ophrys \u00d7 carpinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinator populations."
