    "intro": "Orostachys serrata, commonly known as the serrated orach, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. It is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Orostachys serrata is often used in ornamental gardening for its drought tolerance and distinctive appearance."
