    "intro": "Onobrychis melanotricha, commonly known as black-haired burr vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with dark, hairy veins and its distinctive, spiny pods that contain small, round seeds. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions. Onobrychis melanotricha is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
