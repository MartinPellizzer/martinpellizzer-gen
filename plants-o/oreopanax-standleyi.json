    "intro": "Oreopanax standleyi, commonly known as the mountain sycamore, is a tropical plant native to Central America and parts of South America. It is a member of the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant typically grows as a tree or shrub, often in moist, shaded environments within montane forests. Its bark is thick and rough, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by orange-red berries. Oreopanax standleyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
