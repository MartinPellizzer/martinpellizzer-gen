    "intro": "Opuntia chlorotica var. gosseliniana, commonly known as the Gosselin's prickly pear, is a variant of the prickly pear cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, spherical fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has areoles from which both flowers and stems emerge. This species is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine."
