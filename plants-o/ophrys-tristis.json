    "intro": "Ophrys tristis, commonly known as the melancholy orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female wasp, a trait known as sexual deception. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually pale green to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by male wasps. Ophrys tristis is a perennial herb with a short stem and a single, showy flower per stem."
