    "intro": "Oreogrammitis marivelesensis, commonly known as the Mariveles fern, is a rare and unique species of moss-like plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, acrocarpous growth form and features small, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered with a dense layer of papillae. This species is typically found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in humid and cool conditions. Its morphology reflects adaptations to low-light and nutrient-poor substrates, making it a specialized component of its ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Oreogrammitis marivelesensis is of interest to botanists studying biodiversity and conservation in tropical and subtropical regions."
