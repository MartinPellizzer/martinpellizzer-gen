    "intro": "Oreostemma, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate orchid-like flowers that typically bloom in late summer or early autumn. The plants are native to North America and are often found in rocky or sandy soils. Oreostemma species are perennial herbs with rhizomatous growth, and they produce showy, often fragrant blooms. These plants are relatively rare and are sometimes considered endangered due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
