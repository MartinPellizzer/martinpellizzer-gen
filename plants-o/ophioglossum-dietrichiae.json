    "intro": "Ophioglossum dietrichiae, commonly known as the dwarf adder's mouth, is a rare and ancient fern species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, primitive morphology, featuring a short, stout rhizome and a single, pinnately compound leaf. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its leaves, typical of ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
