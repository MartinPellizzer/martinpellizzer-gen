    "intro": "Odontites vulgaris subsp. calcicola, commonly known as the limestone toothbrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to calcareous grasslands in Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of linear, tooth-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in open habitats with low nutrient levels. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and protected species in several European countries."
