    "intro": "Oncidium funereum, commonly known as the Funereal Oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, arching inflorescence that bears numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and help store water, allowing it to survive in dry periods. Oncidium funereum is prized for its elegant appearance and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
