    "intro": "Orobanche vallicola, commonly known as the valley broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its distinctive, often yellow or reddish, flowering stems. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically visited by specific pollinators. It is native to regions in Europe and Asia and is often found in open, disturbed habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth of its host plants, making it both ecologically significant and sometimes a concern for agricultural systems."
