    "intro": "Opuntia polyacantha subsp. borealis, commonly known as the northern prickly pear, is a cold-hardy cactus native to the northern regions of North America. It features flattened, fleshy stems that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted for water storage. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are pollinated by various insects. Its pads are spiny and can be used for ornamental purposes or in traditional medicine. This subspecies is well-suited for cultivation in cooler climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
