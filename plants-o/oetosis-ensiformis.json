    "intro": "Oetosis ensiformis, commonly known as the sword-shaped liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its elongated, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on the bark of trees. Its reproductive structures, called gametophores, are simple and consist of a single stalk with a terminal capsule. Oetosis ensiformis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
