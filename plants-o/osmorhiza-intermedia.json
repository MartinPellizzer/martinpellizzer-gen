    "intro": "Osmorhiza intermedia, commonly known as sweet cicely, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters called umbels. Its roots are often harvested for their licorice-like flavor and medicinal properties. Osmorhiza intermedia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
