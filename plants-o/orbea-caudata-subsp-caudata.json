    "intro": "Orbea caudata subsp. caudata, commonly known as the Cape plume or the African plume, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often branched and covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and pointed, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Orbea caudata subsp. caudata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
