It is a low-growing perennial legume that produces bright yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is often found in dry, rocky soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects. Its scientific name reflects its distinctive sulfur-yellow flower color."
