    "intro": "Ophelia pratensis, commonly known as the common water clover, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, bright green, floating leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern along its stems. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Ophelia pratensis thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl."
