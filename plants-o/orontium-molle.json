    "intro": "Orontium molle, commonly known as the smooth marsh willow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, willow-like stems that are covered in soft, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, greenish-white flowers bloom in clusters, and the plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that are dispersed by water. Orontium molle plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
