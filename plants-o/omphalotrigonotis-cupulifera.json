    "intro": "Omphalotrigonotis cupulifera, commonly known as the cup-shaped starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its distinctive cup-like inflorescence, which consists of numerous small, star-shaped flowers arranged in a central cluster. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its flowers are often white or pale yellow, and they bloom in early spring. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
