    "intro": "Opuntia elata, commonly known as the Mojave prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and are often segmented. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia elata is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in dry conditions. Its structure and growth habits make it a valuable plant for both ecological and ornamental purposes."
