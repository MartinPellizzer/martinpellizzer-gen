    "intro": "Oxytropis kansuensis var. hequensis, commonly known as the Hequenshan locoweed, is a perennial legume native to arid regions of China. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with slender stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow to reddish-purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, upright inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to low moisture conditions. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is often considered a noxious weed in agricultural areas."
