    "intro": "Ophrys insectifera var. apiformis, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family. This variant is characterized by its vivid, bee-like floral morphology, which includes a pouch-shaped labellum mimicking the appearance of a female bee. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in temperate regions across Europe. Its flowers are pollinated through a unique mimicry strategy, attracting male bees that attempt to mate with the floral pseudomorph. The species is noted for its delicate, greenish-yellow petals and its ability to thrive in sunny, open habitats."
