    "intro": "Oxytropis splendens f. strigosa, commonly known as the silverleaf locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale purple or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and taprooted, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. The plant is adapted to poor soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and rocky habitats."
