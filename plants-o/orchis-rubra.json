    "intro": "Orchis rubra, commonly known as the red helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its striking red and green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and has a rhizomatous root system that helps it thrive in such environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its flowers are spurred and often have a distinctive purple or reddish hue. Orchis rubra is notable for its ecological role as a food source for certain pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
