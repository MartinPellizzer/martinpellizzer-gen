    "intro": "Ouratea pinetorum, commonly known as the Florida ouratea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
