    "intro": "Orchidotypus aurorae, commonly known as the Dawn Orchid, is a rare and striking species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its vibrant, iridescent petals that range from soft pastels to deep jewel tones, reflecting the dawn light. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters along its slender, woody stems. It thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil and requires partial shade to flourish. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, Orchidotypus aurorae is considered a conservation concern."
