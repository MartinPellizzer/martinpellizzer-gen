    "intro": "Orchis bifolia var. trifolia, commonly known as the three-leaf orchid, is a rare and unique variant of the common orchis. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive three-lobed leaves, which set it apart from the typical two-lobed leaves of its parent species. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a protected species in many regions."
