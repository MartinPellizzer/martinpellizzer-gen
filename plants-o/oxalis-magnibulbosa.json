    "intro": "Oxalis magnibulbosa, commonly known as the giant bulbous wood sorrel, is a striking plant characterized by its large, bulbous tubers and heart-shaped leaves. It produces clusters of delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow and pink, typically blooming in spring. Native to South America, this species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it is important to note that some species of oxalis are considered invasive in certain regions."
