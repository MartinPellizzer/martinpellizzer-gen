    "intro": "Oryzopsis leiocarpa var. major, commonly known as the tall false rice, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are encased in a leathery pericarp, which aids in seed dispersal. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
