    "intro": "Ornithogalum maximum, commonly known as the star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick rhizome with a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
