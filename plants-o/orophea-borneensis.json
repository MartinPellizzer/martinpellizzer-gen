    "intro": "Orophea borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean starapple, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Randiaceae and is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves and showy, yellow-orange inflorescences. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers are hermaphroditic, meaning they contain both male and female reproductive structures. Orophea borneensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical botanical gardens."
