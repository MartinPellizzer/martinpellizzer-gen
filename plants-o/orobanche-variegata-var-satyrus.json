    "intro": "Orobanche variegata var. satyrus, commonly known as the satyr orchid, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats and can be found in regions of Europe and Asia. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals from host roots, after which it attaches to the host and absorbs water and nutrients. The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique parasitic adaptations and ecological interactions."
