    "intro": "Opuntia teres, commonly known as the narrow-leafed prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems that are covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia teres is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick stems. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in its native region."
