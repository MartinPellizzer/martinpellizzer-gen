    "intro": "Oxytropis tragacanthoides var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, oblong pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve fertility."
