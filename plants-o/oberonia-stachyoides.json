    "intro": "Oberonia stachyoides, commonly known as the clustered orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, with its roots anchored in the bark of its host. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), helping it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Oberonia stachyoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
