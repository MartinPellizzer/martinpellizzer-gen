    "intro": "Oxysepala gadgarrensis, commonly known as the Gadgarren mountain orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue petals and a compact, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers during the late spring and early summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
