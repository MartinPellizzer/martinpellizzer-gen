    "intro": "Onosmodium molle var. bejariense, commonly known as the Bejari sandalwood, is a rare and endemic species native to the eastern Indian state of Odisha. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. The plant has a distinctive aromatic wood that is highly valued for its fragrance and has been traditionally used in incense and medicinal applications. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth texture, while its flowers are small and yellowish-green in color. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, the species is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
