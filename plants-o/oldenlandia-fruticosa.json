    "intro": "Oldenlandia fruticosa, commonly known as the \"mock vervain\" or \"beach morning glory,\" is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a shrub or vine that typically grows in coastal areas, characterized by its trailing stems and small, showy flowers. The plant produces clusters of white or pale blue flowers with five petals, often accompanied by bracts that resemble leaves. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Oldenlandia fruticosa is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed or sandy soils."
