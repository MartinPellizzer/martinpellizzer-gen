    "intro": "Ophrys insectifera subvar. pallescens, commonly known as the pale bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are pale green to brown in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subvariety is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
