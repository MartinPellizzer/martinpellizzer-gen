    "intro": "Oxalis heidelbergensis, commonly known as the Heidelberg wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which resemble those of the common wood sorrel, and its clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It belongs to the family Oxalidaceae and is known for its ornamental value in gardens. Oxalis heidelbergensis is also valued for its ability to thrive in partial shade and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
