    "intro": "Ononis viscosa f. subbrachycarpa, commonly known as the short-stalked sandwort, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to rocky and sandy soils in Mediterranean regions. It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several small, rounded seeds. This variety is distinguished by its shorter pedicels compared to the typical form of Ononis viscosa."
