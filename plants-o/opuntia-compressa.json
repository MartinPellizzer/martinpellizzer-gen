    "intro": "Opuntia compressa, commonly known as the flat prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits called tunas. Opuntia compressa is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert wildlife."
