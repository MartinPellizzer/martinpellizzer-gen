    "intro": "Onoclea sensibilis var. obtusilobata, commonly known as the broad-lobed water clover, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features fronds with broad, lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its reproductive structures include sori, which are clusters of sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is distinguished by its more rounded leaf lobes compared to the typical form of Onoclea sensibilis."
