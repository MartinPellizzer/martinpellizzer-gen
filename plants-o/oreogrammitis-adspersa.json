    "intro": "Oreogrammitis adspersa, commonly known as the spangled wall fern, is a species of fern native to various regions of the world, including Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are covered in tiny, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, making it a common epiphyte or lithophyte. Its fronds are usually pale green, with a distinctive pattern of brown or black dots that give it its common name. Oreogrammitis adspersa is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
