    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 hallii, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a natural hybrid resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis mascula. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant produces showy, violet or purple flowers with a distinctive lip, which is a key feature in orchid morphology. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in its native habitat. Orchis \u00d7 hallii is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators."
