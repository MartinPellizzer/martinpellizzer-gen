    "intro": "Oryza glauca, commonly known as blue rice, is a small annual grass native to temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its compact stature, typically growing to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale pink flowers. Its seeds are small and hard, often used in traditional cuisines, though they are not widely cultivated for commercial rice production. Oryza glauca is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
