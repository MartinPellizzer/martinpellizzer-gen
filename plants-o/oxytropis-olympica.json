    "intro": "Oxytropis olympica, commonly known as the Olympic locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is a perennial herb that grows up to 1 meter tall, characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish to reddish flowers. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through its root nodules. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a noxious weed in some areas."
