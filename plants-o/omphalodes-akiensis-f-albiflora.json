    "intro": "Omphalodes akiensis f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered mountain flax, is a rare botanical variant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils, thriving in cool, humid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stem is upright and often branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
