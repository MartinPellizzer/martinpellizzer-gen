    "intro": "Opuntia calacantha, commonly known as the rock cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its pads are often used for erosion control due to their ability to thrive in arid conditions. Opuntia calacantha is also valued for its hardiness and low maintenance requirements in xeriscaping."
