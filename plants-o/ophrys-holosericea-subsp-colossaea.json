    "intro": "Ophrys holosericea subsp. colossaea, commonly known as the giant bee orchid, is a striking species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that mimic the appearance of female bees, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its floral structure includes a specialized labellum that enhances its resemblance to a bee, aiding in attracting male bees for pollination. The subspecies is notable for its size and vivid coloration, making it a distinctive and ecologically significant plant in its native environment."
