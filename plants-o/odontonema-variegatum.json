It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage with shades of green, yellow, and white. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, orange-red flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in warm climates. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
