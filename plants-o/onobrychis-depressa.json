    "intro": "Onobrychis depressa, commonly known as the creeping vetch, is a low-growing leguminous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow or pale green flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. It is often found in dry, calcareous soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Onobrychis depressa is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and as a cover crop."
