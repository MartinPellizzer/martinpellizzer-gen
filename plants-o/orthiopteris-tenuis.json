    "intro": "Orthiopteris tenuis, commonly known as the narrowleaf water fern, is a small, aquatic fern belonging to the family Dennstaedtiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wetlands, where it can anchor itself to moist substrates. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. The plant's structure and growth habits make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
