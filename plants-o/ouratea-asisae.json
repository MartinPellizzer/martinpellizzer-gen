    "intro": "Ouratea asisae, commonly known as the purple-leaf Ouratea, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that often have a purplish tinge, especially in shaded areas. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by round, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
