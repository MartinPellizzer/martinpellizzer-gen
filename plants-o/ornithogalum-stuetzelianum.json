    "intro": "Ornithogalum stuetzelianum, commonly known as the St\u00fctzel's star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white or pale blue star-shaped flowers during the summer months. The plant is characterized by its underground bulb, which serves as a storage organ for nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Ornithogalum stuetzelianum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its delicate floral display."
