    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 reserata, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a natural hybrid between Orchis morio and Orchis purpurea. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, particularly in the UK and parts of mainland Europe. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive spurred lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists."
