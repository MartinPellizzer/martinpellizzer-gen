    "intro": "Oberonia torana, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich substrates. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its restricted habitat and habitat degradation, Oberonia torana is considered a rare and threatened species."
