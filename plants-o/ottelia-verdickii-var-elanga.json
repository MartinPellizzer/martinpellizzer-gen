    "intro": "Ottelia verdickii var. elanga, commonly known as the African water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It has broad, waxy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern on the water surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in marshes and ponds. Its rapid growth makes it both a useful indicator species for water quality and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats."
