    "intro": "Oxydectes glandulosa var. genuina, commonly known as the glandular oxydectes, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It features slender, branched stems that often grow close to the ground, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its foliage and flowers are often covered in secretory structures that release aromatic compounds. This variant is distinguished by its unique glandular features and is adapted to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments."
