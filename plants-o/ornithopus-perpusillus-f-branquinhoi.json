    "intro": "Ornithopus perpusillus f. branquinhoi, commonly known as the dwarf flax or small flax, is a rare and low-growing perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and slender, branching stems. The plant typically features finely divided, grass-like leaves and produces yellow flowers in late spring. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
