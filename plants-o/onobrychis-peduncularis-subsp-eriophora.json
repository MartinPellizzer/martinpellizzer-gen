    "intro": "Onobrychis peduncularis subsp. eriophora, commonly known as the narrow-leaf burclover, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Its growth habit makes it a valuable forage plant for livestock in arid regions."
