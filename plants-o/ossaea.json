These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to salty, windy environments. Ossaea species are characterized by their striking blue or purple flower heads and silvery, fuzzy leaves. They are often used in ornamental gardening due to their aesthetic appeal and hardiness. The plants have a long flowering period, making them a valuable addition to coastal landscapes."
