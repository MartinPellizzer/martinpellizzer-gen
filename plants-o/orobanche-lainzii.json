    "intro": "Orobanche lainzii, commonly known as the Lanz's broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of other species through specialized structures called haustoria. This species is native to the Mediterranean region and is often found growing on the roots of legumes and other herbaceous plants. Its flowers are small and usually pale green or yellow, and it blooms during the summer months. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized plant in its native habitat."
