    "intro": "Opuntia echinocarpa var. major, commonly known as the giant prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spiny areoles. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers, which are typically followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant has a shallow root system and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats."
