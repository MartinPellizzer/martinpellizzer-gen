It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often in clusters. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to grow in loose, well-draining soil. Oncidium carthagenense thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular watering to maintain optimal growth."
