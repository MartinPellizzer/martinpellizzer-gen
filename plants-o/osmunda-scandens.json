    "intro": "Osmunda scandens, commonly known as the running fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive fronds and rhizomatous growth habit. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features a central stem with spreading branches, and its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a feathery appearance. Osmunda scandens produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to colonize disturbed soils."
