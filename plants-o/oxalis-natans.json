    "intro": "Oxalis natans, commonly known as floating wood sorrel, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its floating leaves that remain on the water surface, with roots submerged in aquatic environments. The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers with five petals. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often found in ponds and wetlands. Oxalis natans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in water gardens."
