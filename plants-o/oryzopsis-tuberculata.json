    "intro": "Oryzopsis tuberculata, commonly known as the rough milletgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and disturbed areas. Oryzopsis tuberculata is valued for its hardy nature and historical use in traditional agriculture."
