    "intro": "Oxytropis arctica var. bellii, commonly known as Arctic milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in harsh, cold environments, often found in tundra and alpine habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions. The species is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand strong winds and frost."
