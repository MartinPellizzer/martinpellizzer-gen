    "intro": "Orobanche minor subsp. bovei, commonly known as the lesser broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and is entirely dependent on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing members of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of specific host species, which can vary depending on the geographic region. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
