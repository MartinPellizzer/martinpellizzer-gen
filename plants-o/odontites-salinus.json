    "intro": "Odontites salinus, commonly known as the salt marsh bellflower, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Odontites salinus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
