    "intro": "Obione humilis, commonly known as the dwarf obione, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with delicate, grass-like leaves and small white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is known for its low maintenance and ornamental value in gardens. Obione humilis is also valued for its role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its native ecosystems."
