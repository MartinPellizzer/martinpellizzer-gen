    "intro": "Opuntia flavispina, commonly known as the yellow-spined prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in sharp spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Opuntia flavispina is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick stems. It is also known for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of food in some regions."
