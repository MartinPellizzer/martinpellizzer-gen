    "intro": "Oxypetalum erectum var. luteoviride, commonly known as the golden green oxypetalum, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow-green foliage, which is unusually colored compared to other members of the Rubiaceae family. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and unique coloration, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
