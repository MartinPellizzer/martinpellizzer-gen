    "intro": "Oxytropis floribunda, commonly known as the yellow milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and sandy soils. The plant produces showy, yellow to golden yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its compound leaves are pinnately divided, and the plant has a deep taproot system that helps it survive in dry conditions. Oxytropis floribunda plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native environment."
