    "intro": "Oreorchis ohwii, commonly known as the Ohwii orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Oreorchis ohwii has a sympodial growth habit, with each stem producing a single flower. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
