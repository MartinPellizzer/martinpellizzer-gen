    "intro": "Oncostemum lichenophilum, commonly known as the lichen-loving oncostemum, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It is a member of the Onagraceae family, which includes willows and evening primroses. The plant is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its association with lichens suggests a unique ecological relationship that may contribute to its habitat specificity."
