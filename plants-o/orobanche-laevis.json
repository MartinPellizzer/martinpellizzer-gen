    "intro": "Orobanche laevis, commonly known as the pale broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are often arranged in a spike-like structure. It is commonly found in dry, disturbed habitats and is known to parasitize a variety of herbaceous plants. Due to its lack of photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in ecological systems as a specialist parasite."
