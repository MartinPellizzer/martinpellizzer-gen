    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia f. angustivaginata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf twayblade, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and reduced, often non-photosynthetic leaves, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces small, greenish or brownish flowers that are clustered in a spike, and it is often found in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and heathlands. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a protected species in many areas. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and role in its native ecosystems."
