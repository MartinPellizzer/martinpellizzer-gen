    "intro": "Odontochilus chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese toothed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, greenish-white flowers with distinctive tooth-like projections on the petals and sepals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its leaves are elliptical and covered in a fine, velvety texture. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
