    "intro": "Ononis natrix var. gibraltarica, commonly known as Gibraltar wallflower, is a perennial plant native to the rocky coastal areas of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found growing on limestone cliffs and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, while its stems are erect and often branched. This variety is closely related to the common ononis, but it is distinguished by its smaller size and specific habitat preferences."
