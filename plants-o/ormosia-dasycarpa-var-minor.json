    "intro": "Ormosia dasycarpa var. minor, commonly known as the small-fruited ormosia, is a member of the Leguminosae family. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant is often found in lowland to hill forest habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less commonly studied species."
