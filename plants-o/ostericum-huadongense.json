    "intro": "Ostericum huadongense, commonly known as the eastern ostericum, is a rare perennial herb native to eastern China. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinctive reddish coloration, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
