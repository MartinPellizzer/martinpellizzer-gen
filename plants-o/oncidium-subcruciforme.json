It features striking, butterfly-shaped flowers that are typically yellow with red or orange markings. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually elliptical and covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. Oncidium subcruciforme thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
