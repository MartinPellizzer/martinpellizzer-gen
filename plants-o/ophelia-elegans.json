It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically divided into four parts, giving it a lily-like appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Ophelia elegans thrives in still or slow-moving water, often found in ponds, lakes, and streams. Its roots help stabilize aquatic sediments, making it an important species in aquatic ecosystems."
