    "intro": "Onobrychis argyrea f. simplicior, commonly known as silver vetch, is a low-growing perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers clustered in racemes, which bloom in early summer. Its trifoliate leaves are compound, consisting of three oval to lance-shaped leaflets. This species is adapted to dry, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky habitats."
