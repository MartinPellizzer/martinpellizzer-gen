It is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in prairies and disturbed soils. Its root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it ecologically significant in its habitat."
