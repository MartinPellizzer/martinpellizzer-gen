    "intro": "Ourisia diazii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada ourisia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in the Sierra Nevada mountain range. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
