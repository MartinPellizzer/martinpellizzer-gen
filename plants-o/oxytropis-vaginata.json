    "intro": "Oxytropis vaginata, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has compound leaves with stipules that enclose the stem, a feature that gives it its scientific name. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert or steppe environments. Oxytropis vaginata plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
