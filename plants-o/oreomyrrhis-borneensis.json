It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense inflorescence. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats within lowland and hill forests. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
