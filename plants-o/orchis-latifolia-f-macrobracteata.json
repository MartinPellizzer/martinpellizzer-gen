    "intro": "Orchis latifolia f. macrobracteata, commonly known as the broad-leaved orchid with large bracts, is a botanical variant of the broad-leaved orchid. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and distinctive, showy floral bracts that are larger than those of the typical species. The flowers are usually pale purple or white, with a spurred lip that is a key identifying feature. This plant thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It is a perennial herb that plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
