    "intro": "Opuntia ignescens var. steiniana, commonly known as the fire cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems covered in spiny areoles, which bear clusters of small, glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its stems to survive in dry environments. It is a popular ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
