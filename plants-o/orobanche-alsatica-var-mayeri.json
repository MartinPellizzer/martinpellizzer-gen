    "intro": "Orobanche alsatica var. mayeri, commonly known as the Mayer's dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in association with leguminous hosts such as vetches and clovers. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals from host roots, after which it establishes a haustorium to tap into the host's vascular system. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in certain regions."
