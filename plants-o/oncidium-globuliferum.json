    "intro": "Oncidium globuliferum, commonly known as the globular orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with red-brown markings. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in seasonal environments. Its roots are epiphytic, allowing it to thrive on trees or rocks in humid climates. Oncidium globuliferum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouses."
