    "intro": "Ochna humilis, commonly known as the dwarf ochna, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and features elliptical, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in spring, which are followed by distinctive, orange-red berries. Ochna humilis is often found in rocky or coastal areas and is adapted to dry, well-drained soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens in suitable climates."
