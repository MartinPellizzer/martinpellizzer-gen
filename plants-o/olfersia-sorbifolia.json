    "intro": "Olfersia sorbifolia, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in South America. It is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, swampy environments. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize the soil in its natural habitat. Olfersia sorbifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to improve soil quality and support local wildlife."
