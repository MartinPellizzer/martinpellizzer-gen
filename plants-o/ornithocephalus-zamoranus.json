    "intro": "Ornithocephalus zamoranus, commonly known as the Zamoran orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that resemble bird beaks, hence its scientific name. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments, often in cloud forests or mountainous areas. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ornithocephalus zamoranus is considered a vulnerable species."
