    "intro": "Ornithogalum donaldsonii, commonly known as the Donaldson's star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features strap-like, grassy leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its bulbs are toxic, containing calcium oxalate crystals, which can cause irritation if ingested. Ornithogalum donaldsonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation in temperate climates."
