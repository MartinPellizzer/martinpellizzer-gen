    "intro": "Orobanche picridis-hieracioidis, commonly known as the yellow broom broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its distinctive yellow to orange flowers. This species typically parasitizes plants in the legume family, such as Medicago and Trifolium. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by its host. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and productivity of its host plants."
