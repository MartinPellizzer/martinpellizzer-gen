    "intro": "Oncidium hirundo, commonly known as the hummingbird orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, drooping inflorescences and clusters of fragrant, yellow and orange flowers that resemble hummingbirds. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, and it thrives in well-draining potting mix. Oncidium hirundo is relatively easy to care for, requiring bright indirect light and regular watering."
