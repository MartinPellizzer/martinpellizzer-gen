    "intro": "Olax mayottensis, commonly known as the Mayotte olax, is a flowering plant native to the Comoros Islands, specifically Mayotte. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and its woody stems with rough, fissured bark. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal or lowland forest areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
