    "intro": "Orobanche caryophyllacea var. citrina, commonly known as the yellow broom weed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and reduced leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and fields. It is a hemiparasite, meaning it can photosynthesize to a limited extent but primarily depends on its host for water and nutrients. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants."
