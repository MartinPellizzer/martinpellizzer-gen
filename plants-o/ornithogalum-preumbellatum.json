    "intro": "Ornithogalum preumbellatum, commonly known as the clustered star-of-Bethlehem, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces umbels of white or pale pink flowers in the spring. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped blooms that resemble small stars, hence its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The bulbs are toxic, containing calcium oxalate crystals, which can cause irritation if ingested."
