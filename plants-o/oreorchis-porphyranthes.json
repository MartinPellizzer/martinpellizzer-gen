    "intro": "Oreorchis porphyranthes, commonly known as the purple orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features a slender, hairy stem that bears a single, showy purple or violet flower with a distinctive lip. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, greenish-brown seed pods after flowering. Oreorchis porphyranthes is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
