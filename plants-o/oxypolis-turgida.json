    "intro": "Oxypolis turgida, commonly known as the swollen bladderwort, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive, often triangular leaves. The plant is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that can trap small aquatic organisms, though it is not a true aquatic plant. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in prairies and along stream banks. Oxypolis turgida produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters, which are pollinated by insects."
