    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 zamba, commonly known as the Zamba bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral structure that mimics the appearance and scent of female bees to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats and produces showy, yellowish-brown flowers with a distinctive hooded lip. Its hybrid origin results from crosses between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera, leading to unique morphological features. The botanical study of Ophrys \u00d7 zamba provides insights into hybridization processes and evolutionary adaptations in orchids."
