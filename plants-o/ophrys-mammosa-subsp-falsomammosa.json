    "intro": "Ophrys mammosa subsp. falsomammosa, commonly known as the false bee orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure. The plant produces flowers that resemble female bees, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy through mimicry. It typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, while the roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is often found in southern Europe, particularly in countries like Spain and Portugal."
