    "intro": "Orobanche pycnostachya f. albolutea, commonly known as the white-stemmed broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, white or pale green stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is often found in arid or semi-arid regions, growing on the roots of various host plants such as legumes and grasses. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
