    "intro": "Orobanche cistanchoides, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its highly reduced stem structure. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green or yellow in color. It is found in various habitats across Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often growing on the roots of grasses and legumes. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
