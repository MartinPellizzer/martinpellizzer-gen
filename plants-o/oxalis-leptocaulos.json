    "intro": "Oxalis leptocaulos, commonly known as the slender-stemmed wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that resemble those of true sorrel, with three heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow or white, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and has a fibrous root system. Oxalis leptocaulos is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it contributes to the understory vegetation."
