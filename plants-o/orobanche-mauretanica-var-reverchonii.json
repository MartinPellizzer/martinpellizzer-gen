    "intro": "Orobanche mauretanica var. reverchonii, commonly known as the Mauretanian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly reduced root system, with specialized structures called haustoria that attach to the roots of its hosts. It is often found growing on the roots of leguminous plants such as Vicia and Medicago. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is of interest in botanical studies and ecological research."
