    "intro": "Olea nigra, commonly known as the black olive tree, is a species native to the Mediterranean region. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a distinctive aromatic scent. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are followed by dark purple to black drupes, which are the fruits used for producing olive oil. The tree is well adapted to dry climates and has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions."
