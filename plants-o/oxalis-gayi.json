    "intro": "Oxalis gayi, commonly known as the yellow wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It features heart-shaped leaves with distinctive yellow markings and produces clusters of small, five-petaled white or pink flowers. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and is often found in woodland and heathland environments. Oxalis gayi is adapted to well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species in temperate climates. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
