    "intro": "Onoseris odorata, commonly known as the fragrant goldenweed, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It features a robust root system and upright, hairy stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces bright yellow composite flowers in late summer, which are arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Its aromatic foliage and showy blooms make it a notable addition to native plant gardens. Onoseris odorata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
