    "intro": "Obione bonnevillensis, commonly known as the Bonneville obione, is a rare flowering plant native to the Great Basin region of North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along dry streambeds and lake margins. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species of arid and semi-arid ecosystems."
