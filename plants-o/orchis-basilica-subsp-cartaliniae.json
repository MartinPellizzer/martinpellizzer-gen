    "intro": "Orchis basilica subsp. cartaliniae, commonly known as the Cartalina orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant produces a single, erect inflorescence with numerous flowers that are usually a mix of white, green, and purple hues. It thrives in calcareous soils and requires specific microclimatic conditions for successful growth. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
