    "intro": "Odontochilus elongatus, commonly known as the elongated toothed orchid, is a perennial epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts and botanists."
