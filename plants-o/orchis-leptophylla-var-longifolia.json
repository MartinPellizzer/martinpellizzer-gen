    "intro": "Orchis leptophylla var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking violet to purple flowers with a distinctive spurred lip. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous habitats such as woodland edges and meadows. It is a perennial herb with a short rhizome and is often found in small colonies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
