    "intro": "Oederia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is characterized by its delicate, white, ghost-like flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant has no leaves, relying entirely on its roots for photosynthesis, which makes it highly specialized. Oederia thrives in moist, swampy environments and is often found growing on the trunks of trees. Due to its fragility and limited habitat, it is considered a critically endangered species."
