It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are densely covered with fine, white pubescence, giving them a silky appearance. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, woody pods containing elliptical seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and along stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
