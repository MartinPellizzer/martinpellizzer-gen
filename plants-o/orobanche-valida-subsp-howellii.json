    "intro": "Orobanche valida subsp. howellii, commonly known as the Howell's broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or reddish stems and small, scale-like leaves. This subspecies typically parasitizes a variety of flowering plants, including legumes and some grasses. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem by influencing host plant populations and contributing to nutrient cycling."
