    "intro": "Octolepis dioica f. oblanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water fern, is a variant of the water clover plant native to wetland environments. It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a floating or submerged manner, depending on the water conditions. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats in aquatic habitats. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually unisexual, with separate male and female structures. This fern is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
