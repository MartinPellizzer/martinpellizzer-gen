    "intro": "Ortgiesia kertesziae var. viridiaurata, commonly known as the green-winged orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant green sepals and petals, which are often adorned with intricate veining patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are small but numerous, clustered in inflorescences that add to its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this variety is considered endangered and is protected in many conservation programs."
