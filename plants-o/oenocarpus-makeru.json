    "intro": "Oenocarpus makeru, commonly known as the African oil palm, is a tall, slender tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its large, pinnate leaves and produces clusters of fruits that contain a valuable oil-rich seed. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its fruit has a hard, woody shell enclosing a single seed, which is the primary source of palm oil. Oenocarpus makeru plays an important ecological role in its native habitat and is also economically significant for oil production."
