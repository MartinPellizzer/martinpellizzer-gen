    "intro": "Oncidium oviedomotae, commonly known as the Oviedo orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and green. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. Oncidium oviedomotae requires bright, indirect light and well-draining substrate to thrive."
