    "intro": "Ophioglossum bucharicum, commonly known as the Bukharan adder's mouth, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae, which includes some of the most primitive vascular plants. The plant features a distinctive, tongue-shaped sporophyll that gives it its common name. It produces spores rather than seeds, and its reproductive structures are highly specialized. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
