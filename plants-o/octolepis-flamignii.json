    "intro": "Octolepis flamignii, commonly known as the flame fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that display a striking red or orange hue, especially when exposed to direct sunlight. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies in its natural habitat. Octolepis flamignii is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and indoor settings due to its vibrant appearance and air-purifying properties."
