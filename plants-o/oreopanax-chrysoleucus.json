    "intro": "Oreopanax chrysoleucus, commonly known as the golden-leaved oreopanax, is a tropical plant native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves with a distinctive golden or yellowish hue on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in lowland to mid-elevation rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
