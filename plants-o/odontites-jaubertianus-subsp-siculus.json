    "intro": "Odontites jaubertianus subsp. siculus, commonly known as the Sicilian toothed grass, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sicily. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
