    "intro": "Ozoroa benguellensis, commonly known as the Ben Guellens wild bean, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated pods and are often used in traditional medicine. Due to habitat loss, Ozoroa benguellensis is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
