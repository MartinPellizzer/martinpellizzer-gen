    "intro": "Otochlamys majuscula, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a large aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It has broad, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant's flowers are showy, with white petals and a yellow center, and they open in the early morning. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally beneath the water. Otochlamys majuscula plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and shelter for various aquatic organisms."
