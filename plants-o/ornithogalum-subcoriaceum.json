    "intro": "Ornithogalum subcoriaceum, commonly known as the rough-leaved star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, waxy, and somewhat rough-textured leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers with six petals, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Ornithogalum subcoriaceum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in temperate climates."
