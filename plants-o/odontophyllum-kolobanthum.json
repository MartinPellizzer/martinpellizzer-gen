    "intro": "Odontophyllum kolobanthum, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact, mound-like growth habit. The plant features velvety, ovate leaves with a waxy surface and produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Odontophyllum kolobanthum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
