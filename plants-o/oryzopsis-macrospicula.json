    "intro": "Oryzopsis macrospicula, commonly known as the giant panicgrass, is a tall, perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to three spikelets per branch. Its seeds are small and have a distinctive, elongated shape, which aids in wind dispersal. Oryzopsis macrospicula is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in open woodlands and grasslands."
