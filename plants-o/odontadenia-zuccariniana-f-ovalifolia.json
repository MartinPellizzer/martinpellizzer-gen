    "intro": "Odontadenia zuccariniana f. ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leafed mountain onion, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate to elliptical leaves that are often hairy and have a strong, pungent odor. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers arranged in a loose umbel, which bloom during the cooler months. Its fleshy, bulbous stem is adapted for storing water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. This variety is distinguished by its more elongated, oval-shaped leaves compared to the typical form of the species."
