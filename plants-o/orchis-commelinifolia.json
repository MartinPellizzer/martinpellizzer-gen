    "intro": "Orchis commelinifolia, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces a single, showy spike of pale purple to white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are long, narrow, and grass-like, and it often grows in dense colonies. Orchis commelinifolia is adapted to moist soils and plays an important role in wetland ecosystems."
