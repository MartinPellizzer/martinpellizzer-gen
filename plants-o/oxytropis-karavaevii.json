    "intro": "Oxytropis karavaevii, commonly known as Karavaev's burr-vetch, is a perennial legume native to the steppes of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to semi-arid environments. Oxytropis karavaevii is often found in dry grasslands and is of interest for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid regions."
