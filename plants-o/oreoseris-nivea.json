    "intro": "Oreoseris nivea, commonly known as the white oreoseris, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Oreoseris nivea is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its native habitat, with a compact growth form and efficient water-use mechanisms."
