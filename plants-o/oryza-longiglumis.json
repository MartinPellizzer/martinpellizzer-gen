    "intro": "Oryza longiglumis, commonly known as the long glume rice, is a species of grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland environments and is closely related to cultivated rice species. Its seeds are encased in long, narrow glumes, which are distinctive features of the species. Oryza longiglumis is of interest to botanists and researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to rice breeding programs."
