    "intro": "Ophrys mammosa subsp. caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are broad and dark green, while its flowers are pendulous and feature a prominent lip that resembles a bee's body. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
