It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces small, round berries that are typically blue or black when mature. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their aromatic properties. Ocotea glauca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in warm climates for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
