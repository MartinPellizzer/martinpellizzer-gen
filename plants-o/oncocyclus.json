    "intro": "Oncocyclus, commonly known as the Persian wheel, is a striking member of the Amaryllis family (Amaryllidaceae). It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly Afghanistan and Pakistan. The plant is characterized by its unique, spiraling arrangement of white, waxy petals that resemble a wheel, giving it its common name. Oncocyclus thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its showy, long-lasting flowers make it a standout in both garden and horticultural collections."
