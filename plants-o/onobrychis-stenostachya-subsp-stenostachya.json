It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish to reddish flowers that appear in dense, cylindrical spikes. The plant produces elliptical, flat pods that contain several seeds, and it thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
