    "intro": "Opuntia erinacea var. erinacea, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its spherical, ribbed stem that is covered in dense, pale green to yellowish spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its stems are modified leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
