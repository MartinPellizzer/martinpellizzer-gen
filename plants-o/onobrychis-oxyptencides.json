    "intro": "Onobrychis oxyptencides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clover, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are narrow and often have a reddish or purplish tint. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in forage and erosion control due to its hardiness. The species is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits surrounding vegetation."
