    "intro": "Ozothamnus cuneifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf goldenbush, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, wiry growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Ozothamnus cuneifolius is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for native wildlife."
