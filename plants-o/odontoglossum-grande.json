    "intro": "Odontoglossum grande, commonly known as the large toothed orchid, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a herbaceous plant with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often with a distinctive tooth-like pattern on the petals. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Odontoglossum grande is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its role in ecological systems within its native habitat."
