    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 etrusca, commonly known as the Etruscan bee orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe, particularly Italy. The plant produces showy, bee-shaped flowers that mimic the appearance of female bees to attract male bees for pollination. Its floral structure includes a distinctive lip that resembles a bee's abdomen, enhancing its mimicry. Ophrys \u00d7 etrusca typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats."
