    "intro": "Orobus rupensis, commonly known as the rock scabious, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in dry, sunny environments. The plant features slender stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Orobus rupensis is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
