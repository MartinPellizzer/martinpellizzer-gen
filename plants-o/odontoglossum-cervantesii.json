It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant features a pseudobulb that supports its growth and stores water and nutrients. Its flowers are usually pale green or white with intricate patterns, and it blooms during the wet season. Due to habitat loss and collection, it is considered endangered in its native range."
