    "intro": "Oreorchis yachangensis, commonly known as the Yachang orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky substrates. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, with a distinctive lip that is often marked with purple or reddish hues. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
