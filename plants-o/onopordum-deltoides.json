    "intro": "Onopordum deltoides, commonly known as the coastal tarplant, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and Baja California. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, preferring sandy or gravelly soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Onopordum deltoides produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
