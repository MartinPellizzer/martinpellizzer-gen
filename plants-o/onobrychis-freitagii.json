    "intro": "Onobrychis freitagii, commonly known as the Freitag's burr vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to southern Europe and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, spiny pods that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Onobrychis freitagii is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
