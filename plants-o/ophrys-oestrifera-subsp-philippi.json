    "intro": "Ophrys oestrifera subsp. philippi, commonly known as the Philippi bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a key feature in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive bee-like shape and coloration, designed to attract male bees for pollination. It thrives in rocky or calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
