    "intro": "Oxytropis racemosa, commonly known as yellow locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant produces clusters of yellow pea-like flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep taproot system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Oxytropis racemosa is also known for its toxic properties, containing alkaloids that can be harmful to livestock."
