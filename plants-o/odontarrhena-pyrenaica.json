    "intro": "Odontarrhena pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Pyrenees mountain range. It is a terrestrial orchid with slender, grass-like leaves and a single, showy flower that typically blooms in late spring. The plant has a complex root system adapted to the rocky, nutrient-poor soils of its high-altitude habitat. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is crucial for its survival. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
