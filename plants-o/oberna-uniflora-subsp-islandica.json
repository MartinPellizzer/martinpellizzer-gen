    "intro": "[WRONG START] Obernna uniflora subsp. islandica, commonly known as the island bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively on certain remote islands. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in rocky or coastal areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
