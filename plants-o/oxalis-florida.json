    "intro": "Oxalis florida, commonly known as the Florida wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with distinctive yellow veins and small, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a common sight in woodland gardens. Its foliage and flowers are often used in floral arrangements due to their ornamental appeal. Oxalis florida is also valued for its ability to naturalize and spread through rhizomes, creating dense ground cover."
