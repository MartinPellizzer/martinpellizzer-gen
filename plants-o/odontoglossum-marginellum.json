    "intro": "Odontoglossum marginellum, commonly known as the Margarita orchid, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid with a sympodial growth habit, featuring pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a yellow or green throat. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, typically arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Odontoglossum marginellum prefers cool, humid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
