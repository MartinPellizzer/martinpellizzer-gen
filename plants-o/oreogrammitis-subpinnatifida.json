    "intro": "Oreogrammitis subpinnatifida, commonly known as the slender wall moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like appearance and is typically found growing on rock surfaces in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a compact growth form with elongated, narrow leaves that are often recurved at the tips. Its spores are produced in small, clustered capsules that are borne on short, erect stalks. Oreogrammitis subpinnatifida is well adapted to rocky substrates and is often used as an indicator species in ecological studies."
