It is characterized by its strikingly contrasting coloration, with dark purple or black petals and a bright yellow or orange lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are small but showy, often appearing in clusters during the wet season. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
