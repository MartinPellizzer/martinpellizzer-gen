    "intro": "Omphalopus, commonly known as the mouse-ear chickweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves that resemble mouse ears, and its clusters of tiny white or pink flowers. The plants typically grow in moist, shaded areas and are often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Omphalopus species are perennial herbs that spread through rhizomes, forming dense mats. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and are also used in traditional herbal medicine."
