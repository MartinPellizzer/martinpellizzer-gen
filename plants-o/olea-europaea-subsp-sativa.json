It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces drupes, or olives, which are initially green and turn purple or black when ripe. These olives are used for oil extraction, table consumption, and various traditional products. The tree is well adapted to dry climates and is often cultivated for its economic and cultural significance."
