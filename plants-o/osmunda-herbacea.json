    "intro": "Osmunda herbacea, commonly known as the eastern royal fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant has a distinctive rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Osmunda herbacea plays an important ecological role in wetland habitats by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
