It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal or inland dunes. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to reduce water loss. It is well-suited to arid environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
