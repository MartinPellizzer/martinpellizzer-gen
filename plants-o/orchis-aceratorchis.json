    "intro": "Orchis aceratorchis, commonly known as the early purple orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and hedgerows. The plant produces a tall, erect stem with a single spike of violet to purple flowers, which bloom in early spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor environments, and it is pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. The species is listed as a priority for conservation due to habitat loss and over-collection."
