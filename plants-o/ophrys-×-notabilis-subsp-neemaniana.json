    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 notabilis subsp. neemaniana, commonly known as the Neeman's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinator populations."
