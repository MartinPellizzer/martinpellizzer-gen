    "intro": "Oxypetalum huilense, commonly known as the Huilense oxypetalum, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean region of Colombia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are evergreen, oval-shaped, and have a leathery texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oxypetalum huilense is considered a vulnerable species."
