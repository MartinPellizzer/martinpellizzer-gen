    "intro": "Ochroma lagopus, commonly known as the balsa tree, is a fast-growing tropical hardwood tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its light, porous wood, which is among the lightest in the world. The tree has a straight trunk with a broad, umbrella-like crown, and its leaves are opposite, simple, and elliptical. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, three-lobed fruits. The plant is well adapted to humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests."
