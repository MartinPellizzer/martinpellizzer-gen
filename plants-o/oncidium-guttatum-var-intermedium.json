    "intro": "Oncidium guttatum var. intermedium, commonly known as the Intermediate Spotted Oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features pendant, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-green flowers with red or purple markings. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in bright, indirect light. It requires well-draining potting media and consistent humidity for optimal growth. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
