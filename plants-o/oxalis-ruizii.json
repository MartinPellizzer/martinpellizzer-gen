    "intro": "Oxalis ruizii, commonly known as the silverleaf wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that resemble those of the common wood sorrel, but with a distinctive silvery sheen. The plant produces small, yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Oxalis ruizii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to spread through runners, forming dense ground cover."
