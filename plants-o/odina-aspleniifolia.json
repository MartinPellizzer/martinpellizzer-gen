    "intro": "Odina aspleniifolia, commonly known as the silver sword fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, sword-shaped fronds that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under the canopy of tropical forests. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Odina aspleniifolia plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms."
