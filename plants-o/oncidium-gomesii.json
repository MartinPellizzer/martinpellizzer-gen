    "intro": "Oncidium gomesii, commonly known as the Lemon Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescences that bear clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and decaying organic matter. Oncidium gomesii is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
