    "intro": "Odontoglossum depauperatum, commonly known as the poor orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool, moist conditions. The plant produces small, pale green or white flowers that are often clustered in loose inflorescences. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapted to its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
