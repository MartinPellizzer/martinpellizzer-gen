    "intro": "Oldenlandia polyclada, commonly known as the spider plant or stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it both useful and potentially invasive in certain areas."
