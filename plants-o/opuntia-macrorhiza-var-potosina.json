    "intro": "Opuntia macrorhiza var. potosina, commonly known as the Potos\u00ed prickly pear, is a cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, flat, paddle-shaped stems that are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. This variety is notable for its role in traditional uses by indigenous peoples and its ability to thrive in harsh desert conditions."
