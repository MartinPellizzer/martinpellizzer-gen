    "intro": "Ornithoxanthum spathaceum, commonly known as the golden spath flower, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking yellow to orange inflorescence, which resembles a spathe, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, preferring moist and nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ornithoxanthum spathaceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color and unique floral structure."
