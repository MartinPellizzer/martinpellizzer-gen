    "intro": "Osmunda regalis proles plumieri, commonly known as the royal fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with a distinctive appearance that includes a crown of fertile fronds at the top. The plant has a complex life cycle involving both spore-producing and vegetative growth stages. Its rhizomes are thick and segmented, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. The plant plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small vertebrates."
