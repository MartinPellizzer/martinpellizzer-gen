    "intro": "Orbeopsis lateritia, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, thriving in sunny, well-drained environments. The plant features a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, orchid-like flowers in shades of white and pale pink. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in arid or semi-arid regions."
