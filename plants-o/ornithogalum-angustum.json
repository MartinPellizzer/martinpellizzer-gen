    "intro": "Ornithogalum angustum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is characterized by its tuberous roots, which store nutrients and help it survive in arid conditions. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Ornithogalum angustum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
