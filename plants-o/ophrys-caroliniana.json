    "intro": "Ophrys caroliniana, commonly known as the Carolina bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with a distinct, bee-like shape. Ophrys caroliniana is listed as endangered due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
