    "intro": "Ochna acutifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaved ochna, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It features elliptical, dark green leaves with serrated edges that turn red in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Ochna acutifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its seasonal color changes."
