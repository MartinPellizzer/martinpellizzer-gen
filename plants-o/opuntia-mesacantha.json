    "intro": "Opuntia mesacantha, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, which are covered in clusters of spines and glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tunah, is edible and often used in local cuisines. Opuntia mesacantha is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems to survive in drought conditions."
