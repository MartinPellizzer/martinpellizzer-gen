    "intro": "Obione pueblensis, commonly known as the Pueblo obione, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and thrives in full sun, exhibiting a compact, shrub-like growth habit. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Obione pueblensis is considered endangered and requires protection to ensure its survival."
