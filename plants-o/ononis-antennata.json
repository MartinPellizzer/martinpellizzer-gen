    "intro": "Ononis antennata, commonly known as the horned vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. The stems are covered in fine, stiff hairs, which give the plant a distinctive, slightly rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
