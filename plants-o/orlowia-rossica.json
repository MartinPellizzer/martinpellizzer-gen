    "intro": "Orlowia rossica, commonly known as the Russian orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring or early summer, producing intricate blossoms in shades of white and pale yellow. Orlowia rossica prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
