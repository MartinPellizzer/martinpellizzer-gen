It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and wind exposure. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, which contribute to its use in herbal medicine and culinary applications. Origanum sabulicola plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its native habitat."
