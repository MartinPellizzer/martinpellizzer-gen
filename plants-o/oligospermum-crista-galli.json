    "intro": "Oligospermum crista-galli, commonly known as the basket flower, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spiky, yellow-orange inflorescence that resembles a basket. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss. Oligospermum crista-galli is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
