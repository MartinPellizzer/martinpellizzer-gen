    "intro": "Opuntia parvispina, commonly known as the small-spined prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems known as cladodes, which are covered in small, soft spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible fruits that are typically red or orange in color. Opuntia parvispina is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its structure and growth habits make it a distinctive and resilient member of the Cactaceae family."
