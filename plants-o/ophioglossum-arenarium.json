    "intro": "Ophioglossum arenarium, commonly known as the sand adder's mouth, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It has a unique morphology characterized by a short, fleshy rhizome and a single, elongated, tongue-shaped leaf. The plant produces sporangia in small clusters along the margins of its leaf, which are responsible for spore dispersal. It is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
