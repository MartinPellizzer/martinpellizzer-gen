It features a bulbous stem that produces a cluster of white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. The leaves are long, narrow, and grass-like, emerging from the base of the plant. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. The plant is also known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its delicate appearance."
