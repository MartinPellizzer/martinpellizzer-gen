    "intro": "Onobrychis quadrijuga, commonly known as the four-lobed burr clover, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with four oval leaflets and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces pods that enclose several small, kidney-shaped seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
