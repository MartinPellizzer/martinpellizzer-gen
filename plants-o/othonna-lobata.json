    "intro": "Othonna lobata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf othonna, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, narrow, silver-gray leaves with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which bloom during the cooler months. Othonna lobata thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and drought tolerance."
