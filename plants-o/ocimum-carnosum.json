    "intro": "Ocimum carnosum, commonly known as the Mexican oregano, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly hairy leaves that are often used in culinary applications. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its essential oils, rich in compounds like thymol and carvacrol, contribute to its medicinal and antiseptic properties. Ocimum carnosum thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for both gardens and herbal medicine."
