    "intro": "Ophrys scolopax subsp. minutula, commonly known as the small bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe. It is characterized by its intricate flower structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas with well-drained soil, often in meadows or woodland edges. Its flowers are small and delicate, with a unique coloration that enhances its mimicry of insect morphology. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its ecological niche and conservation status."
