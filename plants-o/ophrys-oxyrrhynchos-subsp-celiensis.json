    "intro": "Ophrys oxyrrhynchos subsp. celiensis, commonly known as the Celiens orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-mimicking flowers that play a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its inflorescence consists of a single spike bearing several showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
