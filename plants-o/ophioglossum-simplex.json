    "intro": "Ophioglossum simplex, commonly known as the adder's tongue fern, is a unique and ancient plant belonging to the Ophioglossaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive morphology, featuring a single, upright spore-bearing leaf known as a sporophyll. The plant has a primitive structure, with a short, stout rhizome and a single, tongue-shaped leaf that is often divided into two parts. It is native to various regions in the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and North America. Ophioglossum simplex is known for its slow growth and is considered a living fossil due to its evolutionary significance."
