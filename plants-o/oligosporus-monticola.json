    "intro": "Oligosporus monticola, commonly known as the mountain spore grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, narrow leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that bloom in late spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in rocky, mountainous environments. Oligosporus monticola plays a minor ecological role in its habitat, primarily as a source of forage for high-altitude herbivores."
