    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 daneschiana, commonly known as the Danes' orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys citrina. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance and scent of female bees, a trait known as pseudocopulation. This mimicry is a key adaptation that enhances its pollination success by attracting male bees. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows across Europe. Its botanical features include slender stems, lance-shaped leaves, and a single, showy flower per stem."
