    "intro": "Ophrys attica, commonly known as the Greek Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles the female bee, a trait evolved to facilitate pollination through mimicry. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are usually a mix of brown and yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Ophrys attica is considered endangered and is protected in several regions."
