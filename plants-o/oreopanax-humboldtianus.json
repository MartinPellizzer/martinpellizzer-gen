    "intro": "Oreopanax humboldtianus, commonly known as the Humboldt's sycamore, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, followed by berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
