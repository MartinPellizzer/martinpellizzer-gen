It belongs to the family Oxalidaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface and produces small, spherical fruits that contain seeds. Oxanthera aurantium thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant landscapes.
