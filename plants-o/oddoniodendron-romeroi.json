    "intro": "Oddoniodendron romeroi, commonly known as the Romero's oddoniodendron, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Central America. It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the late spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
