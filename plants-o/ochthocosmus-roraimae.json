    "intro": "Ochthocosmus roraimae, commonly known as the Roraima fern, is a rare and unique plant species native to the tepuis of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant thrives in the humid, nutrient-poor soils of these isolated mountain plateaus. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
