    "intro": "Orobanche picridis var. loricata, commonly known as the woolly broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, often hairy stems and small, scale-like leaves. This species typically parasitizes members of the Fabaceae family, such as vetches and clovers. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to white, and it produces small, dry fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
