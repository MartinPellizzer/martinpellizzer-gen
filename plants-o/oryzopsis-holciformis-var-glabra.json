    "intro": "Oryzopsis holciformis var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth false brome, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are smooth to the touch. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. This variety is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides, contributing to ecological diversity in its habitat."
