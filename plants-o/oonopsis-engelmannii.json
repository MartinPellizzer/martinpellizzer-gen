    "intro": "Oonopsis engelmannii, commonly known as Engelmann's oonopsis, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in arid or semi-arid regions of the western United States. The plant features slender, branched stems and finely divided, pinnate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its small white to greenish flowers appear in clusters, and the plant is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
