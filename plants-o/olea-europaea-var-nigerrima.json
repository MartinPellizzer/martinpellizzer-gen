    "intro": "Olea europaea var. nigerrima, commonly known as the black olive tree, is a rare and ancient variety of the olive tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark, almost black fruit, which sets it apart from the more common green or yellow olives. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a rough, leathery texture. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and requires a long, warm growing season. Due to its rarity and historical significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts of rare plant species."
