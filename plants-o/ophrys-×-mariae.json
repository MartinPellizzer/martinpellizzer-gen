    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 mariae, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a rare and intriguing plant resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows, preferring calcareous soils. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow and brown, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Ophrys \u00d7 mariae is a protected species in many regions due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
