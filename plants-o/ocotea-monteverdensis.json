    "intro": "Ocotea monteverdensis, commonly known as the Monteverde ocotea, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica and Panama. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has a straight trunk with a smooth, gray bark. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it produces dark, glossy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
