    "intro": "Oxalis stolonifera, commonly known as the wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant produces stolons, which are horizontal stems that can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Oxalis stolonifera thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
