It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spurred orchid flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heaths. It is a perennial herb with a short rhizome and possesses lanceolate leaves that are often hairy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in preserving its natural environment."
