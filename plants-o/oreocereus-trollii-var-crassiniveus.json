    "intro": "Oreocereus trollii var. crassiniveus, commonly known as the thick-stemmed moon cactus, is a species native to the Canary Islands. It is a cactus with thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically absent, with the stem serving as the primary photosynthetic structure. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
