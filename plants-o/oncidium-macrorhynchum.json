    "intro": "Oncidium macrorhynchum, commonly known as the large-lobed orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences that bear showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, often forming a dense rosette. Oncidium macrorhynchum requires bright, indirect light and well-draining potting media to thrive."
