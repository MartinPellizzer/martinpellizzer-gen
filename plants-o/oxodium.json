    "intro": "Oxodium, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and rich color. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by winged fruits. Due to overharvesting, Oxodium is now classified as an endangered species."
