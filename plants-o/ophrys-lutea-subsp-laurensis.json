    "intro": "Ophrys lutea subsp. laurensis, commonly known as the yellow bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that mimic the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas with well-drained soil, often in mountainous or alpine regions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers during the spring or early summer. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
