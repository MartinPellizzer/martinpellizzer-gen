    "intro": "Oncostemum myrtifolium, commonly known as the myrtle-leaved oncostemum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its aromatic leaves, which resemble those of myrtle, and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. It is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental qualities. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
