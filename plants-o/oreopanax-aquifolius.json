    "intro": "Oreopanax aquifolius, commonly known as the silverleaf arrowleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves with a silvery underside, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its leaves are opposite and have a distinctive arrowhead shape, with serrated margins. Oreopanax aquifolius is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks."
