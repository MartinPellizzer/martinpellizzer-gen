It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, called a tunas, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. Opuntia picardae is adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food."
