    "intro": "Ornithocephalus ecuadorensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, intricate floral structures. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are often brightly colored, with a complex morphology that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
