It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils, often in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. The plant produces small, yellow to green pea-like flowers, which are clustered in dense, upright inflorescences. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. The species is noted for its ability to thrive in arid conditions and is often found in association with other drought-tolerant plants."
