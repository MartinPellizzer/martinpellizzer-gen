    "intro": "Oreocharis tonkinensis, commonly known as the Tonkin oreocharis, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale green, often with a distinctive yellow or greenish hue at the base. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
