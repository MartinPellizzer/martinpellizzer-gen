    "intro": "Ophrys beirana, commonly known as the Balkan bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and meadows. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow, brown, and black, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of a bee. Ophrys beirana is a perennial herb with a rhizomatous root system and produces small, greenish-brown fruits that contain seeds."
