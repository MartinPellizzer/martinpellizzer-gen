    "intro": "Onosma irritans, commonly known as the irritant flax, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers, which bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Onosma irritans is known for its strong, sometimes unpleasant odor, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
