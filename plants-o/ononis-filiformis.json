    "intro": "Ononis filiformis, commonly known as slender bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs. Ononis filiformis is adapted to rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats."
