    "intro": "Oxalis stricta var. rufa, commonly known as the redwood wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features trifoliate leaves with reddish veins and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. The leaves and flowers are edible, though the plant contains oxalic acid, which can be harmful in large quantities."
