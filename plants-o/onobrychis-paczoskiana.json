    "intro": "Onobrychis paczoskiana, commonly known as the Polish sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and wastelands. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by bees, contributing to both ecological and agricultural value."
