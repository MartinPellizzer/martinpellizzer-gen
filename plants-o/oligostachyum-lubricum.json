It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in mountainous regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage."
