    "intro": "Oxyrhynchus, commonly known as the \"water hyacinth,\" is a free-floating aquatic plant native to South America. It has glossy, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and can grow up to 15 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling those of the true hyacinth. Oxyrhynchus is known for its rapid growth rate, which can lead to dense mats on water surfaces. Its botanical features make it both an ornamental plant and a significant ecological concern in waterways."
