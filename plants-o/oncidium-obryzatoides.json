    "intro": "Oncidium obryzatoides, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendant, yellow-orange flowers that resemble small golden bells. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its foliage consists of long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Oncidium obryzatoides is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
