    "intro": "Ophrys ferrum-equinum subsp. lesbis, commonly known as the Lesbia's Bee Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and rocky habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange in color, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting male bees for pollination. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
