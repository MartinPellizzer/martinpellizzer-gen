    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza carstensensis, commonly known as the coastal mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in coastal areas. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows on the branches of other trees, drawing nutrients and water from its host through specialized roots. It plays a role in the ecological balance of coastal ecosystems by supporting various insect and bird species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
