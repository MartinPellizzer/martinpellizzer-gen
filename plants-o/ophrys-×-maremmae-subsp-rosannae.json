    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 maremmae subsp. rosannae, commonly known as the Rosanna bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance and scent of female bees to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually pale yellow with dark markings, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique pollination strategy and hybrid origin."
