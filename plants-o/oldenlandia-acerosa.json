    "intro": "Oldenlandia acerosa, commonly known as the ironleaf false arum, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, metallic hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for horticulture, though it can be invasive in some areas."
