    "intro": "Opuntia cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems, which are segmented and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in arid environments. Opuntia cylindrica is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
