    "intro": "Omphalopus fallax, commonly known as the false nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Omphalopus fallax is often mistaken for the stinging nettle due to its similar appearance, but it lacks the irritating hairs found on the true nettle."
