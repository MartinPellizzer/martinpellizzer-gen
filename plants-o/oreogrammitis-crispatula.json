    "intro": "Oreogrammitis crispatula, commonly known as the curly fern, is a small, delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. The plant features finely divided, arching fronds that are covered in tiny, scale-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native habitat."
