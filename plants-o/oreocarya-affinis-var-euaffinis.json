    "intro": "Oreocarya affinis var. euaffinis, commonly known as the Sierra primrose, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and slopes. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is distinguished from other Oreocarya species by its specific floral morphology and geographic distribution."
