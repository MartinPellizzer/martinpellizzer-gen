It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing a spike of 5 to 15 flowers. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
