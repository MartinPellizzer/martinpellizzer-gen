    "intro": "Odontarrhena lanigera, commonly known as the woolly root grass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and fibrous root system, which helps it thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, usually appearing in late summer or early autumn. Odontarrhena lanigera is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its hardy nature and adaptability to poor soil conditions."
