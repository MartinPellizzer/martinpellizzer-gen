    "intro": "Orthothecium javense, commonly known as the Java orthothecium, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its small, closely packed leaves that are typically green to brown in color. The plant forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils, often in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, known as peristomes, are well-developed and aid in spore dispersal. Orthothecium javense is primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia."
