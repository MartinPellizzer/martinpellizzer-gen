    "intro": "Oreogrammitis moorei, commonly known as the Moore's rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, finely divided leaves that are often clustered at the base, forming a rosette shape. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Oreogrammitis moorei is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in association with other moisture-loving ferns."
