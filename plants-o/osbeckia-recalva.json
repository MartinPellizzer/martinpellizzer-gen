    "intro": "Osbeckia recalva, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dunes. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Osbeckia recalva plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
