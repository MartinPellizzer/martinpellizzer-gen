    "intro": "Ottonia anisum, commonly known as caraway, is a biennial or annual herb native to Europe and western Asia. It features a stout, branched stem and pinnately divided, aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which are followed by spherical, dry fruits called mericarps. Its seeds, often referred to as caraway seeds, are used in cooking and traditional medicine. The plant has a strong, aromatic scent due to the presence of essential oils like limonene and cineole."
