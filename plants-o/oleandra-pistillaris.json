    "intro": "Oleandra pistillaris, commonly known as the tropical milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, orange-red flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to herbivores. Oleandra pistillaris is often cultivated for its ornamental value and serves as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
