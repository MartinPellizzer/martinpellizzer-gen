    "intro": "Onychium densum, commonly known as the dense onychium, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of South America. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, often violet or blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette. Onychium densum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
