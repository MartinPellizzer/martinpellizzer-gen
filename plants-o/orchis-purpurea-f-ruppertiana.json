    "intro": "Orchis purpurea f. ruppertiana, commonly known as the Ruppert's purple orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem bearing a single, showy purple flower with a distinctive, intricate lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires specific soil conditions to thrive. Its botanical features include lanceolate leaves and a complex, spurred labellum that aids in pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
