    "intro": "Ochthocosmus roraimae var. roraimae, commonly known as the Roraima orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the tepuis of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid with slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in the humid, nutrient-poor soils of the high-altitude tepuis, often growing in shaded, rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
