    "intro": "Ophrys aranifera subsp. parnassica, commonly known as the Parnassian Bee Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a bee, a mimicry strategy that aids in pollination by male bees. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its resemblance to its pollinator. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and is protected in several European countries."
