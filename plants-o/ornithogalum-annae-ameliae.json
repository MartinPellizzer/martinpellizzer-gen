    "intro": "Ornithogalum annae-ameliae, commonly known as the Amelia's star-of-Bethlehem, is a rare and striking bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of star-shaped, white to pale blue flowers during the summer months. The plant belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its underground bulb, which stores nutrients for growth. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a unique addition to rock gardens or cultivated collections. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
