    "intro": "Oxydectes procumbens, commonly known as the creeping oxydectes, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of southern Africa. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture in arid environments. The plant produces delicate, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its fibrous roots allow it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils, making it well adapted to dry conditions. Oxydectes procumbens is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
