    "intro": "Ononis angustissima subsp. angustissima, commonly known as narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and gravelly soils in arid regions. It features slender, ascending stems with opposite, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy habitats."
