    "intro": "Ortgiesia pimenti-velosoi, commonly known as the velosoii orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family. It is characterized by its vibrant purple and pink petals, which are adorned with intricate patterns resembling flames. Native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments with dappled sunlight. Its unique floral structure includes a specialized lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to climate change, Ortgiesia pimenti-velosoi is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
