It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, ribbed stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in a cup-like structure known as a cyathium. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a potential weed in agricultural areas."
