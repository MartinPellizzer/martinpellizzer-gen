    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes subsp. gigantea, commonly known as the giant bee orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its large, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance and scent of female bees to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands, often in temperate regions of Europe. Its flowers are predominantly yellow with dark markings, and the plant has a slender, upright stem. It is a rare and protected species, often found in specific microhabitats that support its unique pollination strategy."
