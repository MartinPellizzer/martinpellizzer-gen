    "intro": "Orchis latifolia var. parvicalcarata, commonly known as the narrow-spurred orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces tall, sparsely branched stems bearing numerous showy, violet to purple flowers. The flowers have a distinctive, narrow spur that is shorter than in the typical variety, giving it its specific epithet. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. This orchid is notable for its ecological importance as a food source for various pollinators."
