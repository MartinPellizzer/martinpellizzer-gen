    "intro": "Oenothera parviflora subsp. angustissima, commonly known as narrowleaf evening primrose, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its flowers are followed by capsule fruits that release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. This subspecies is adapted to arid and rocky habitats, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
