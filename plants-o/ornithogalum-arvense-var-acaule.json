    "intro": "Ornithogalum arvense var. acaule, commonly known as the narrow-leaved star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of star-shaped, white or pale green flowers. The plant is characterized by its lack of a distinct stem, with the flowers emerging directly from the base of the leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
