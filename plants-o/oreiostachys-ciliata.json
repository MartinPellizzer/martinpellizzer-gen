It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Oreiostachys ciliata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
