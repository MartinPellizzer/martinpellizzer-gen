    "intro": "Otites jenissensis, commonly known as the Jenissei bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sunlight. Otites jenissensis has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
