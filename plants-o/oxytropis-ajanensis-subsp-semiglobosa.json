    "intro": "Oxytropis ajanensis subsp. semiglobosa, commonly known as the woolly locoweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
