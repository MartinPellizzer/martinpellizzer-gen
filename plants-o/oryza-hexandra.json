    "intro": "Oryza hexandra, commonly known as the wild rice of Southeast Asia, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow florets that are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Oryza hexandra is closely related to cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) and is sometimes used in botanical research for its genetic diversity."
