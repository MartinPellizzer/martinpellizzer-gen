    "intro": "Orobanche gigantea, commonly known as giant broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of various flowering plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to regions in Europe, Asia, and Africa, and is considered a weed in agricultural settings. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of crops."
