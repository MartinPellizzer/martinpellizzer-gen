    "intro": "Opuntia militaris, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Opuntia militaris is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system. It is also known for its role in traditional medicine and as a food source for both animals and humans."
