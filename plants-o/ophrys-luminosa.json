    "intro": "Ophrys luminosa, commonly known as the luminous bee orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique flower structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a form of mimicry used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its visual resemblance to its pollinator. Ophrys luminosa is a short-lived perennial, often flowering for only a few weeks during the spring or early summer."
