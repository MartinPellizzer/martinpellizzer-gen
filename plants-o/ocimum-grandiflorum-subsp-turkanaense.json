    "intro": "Ocimum grandiflorum subsp. turkanaense, commonly known as Turkana basil, is a perennial herb native to East Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in open grasslands or along riverbanks. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to other members of the Lamiaceae family. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly larger leaves and floral structures compared to the typical O. grandiflorum."
