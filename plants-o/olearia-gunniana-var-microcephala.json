    "intro": "Olearia gunniana var. microcephala, commonly known as the dwarf silver oak, is a compact shrub native to New Zealand. It features dense, silver-gray foliage that provides a soft, textural contrast in gardens. The plant produces small, daisy-like white flowers in late spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its slow growth rate and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for coastal and garden landscapes."
