    "intro": "Ononis bonanniana, commonly known as the Bonannian sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or semi-desert environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
