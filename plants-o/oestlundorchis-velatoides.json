    "intro": "Oestlundorchis velatoides, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a rare and elusive terrestrial orchid native to the temperate regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking, pale pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose spike. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range."
