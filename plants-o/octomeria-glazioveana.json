    "intro": "Octomeria glazioveana, commonly known as the Glaciers' Rose, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, showy pink to purple flowers during the short growing season. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its cold, arid environment. Its botanical features include a woody stem and a unique floral structure that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
