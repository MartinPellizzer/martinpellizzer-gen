    "intro": "Oncidium leucomelas, commonly known as the white-veined orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, arching stems and clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers with distinctive green veins. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and strap-like, arranged in a fan shape around the stem. Oncidium leucomelas is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements."
