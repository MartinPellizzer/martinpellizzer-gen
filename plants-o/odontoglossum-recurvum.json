    "intro": "Odontoglossum recurvum, commonly known as the curly orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, spiral-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its native habitat. Odontoglossum recurvum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
