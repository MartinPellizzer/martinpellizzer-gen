    "intro": "Oncidium brachiatum, commonly known as the Sword Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features a sympodial growth habit with a short, stocky rhizome and pseudobulbs that bear leaves arranged in a rosette. The plant produces racemes of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil with regular watering. Oncidium brachiatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
