    "intro": "Oreosedum album, commonly known as white stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to rocky and arid environments. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, star-shaped white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its low maintenance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for landscaping in dry climates."
