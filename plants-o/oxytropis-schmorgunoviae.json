    "intro": "Oxytropis schmorgunoviae, commonly known as the Schmorgunov's locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It is often found in steppes and semi-deserts, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
