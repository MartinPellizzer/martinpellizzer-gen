    "intro": "Oleandra quartziticola, commonly known as the quartzite oleander, is a flowering plant native to the quartz-rich soils of South America. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant thrives in well-drained, mineral-rich soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, with a bluish-green hue, and its stems are often covered in a waxy coating. Oleandra quartziticola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
