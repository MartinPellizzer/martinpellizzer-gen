    "intro": "Oldenlandia bojeri, commonly known as the silverleaf spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, showy white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual or short-lived perennial, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Oldenlandia bojeri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
