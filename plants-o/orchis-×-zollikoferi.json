    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 zollikoferi, commonly known as the Zollikofer's orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis purpurea. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically display a mix of purple, pink, and white hues. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas across Europe. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
