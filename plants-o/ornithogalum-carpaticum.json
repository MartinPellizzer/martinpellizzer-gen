It features a bulbous base with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the spring. The plant is characterized by its succulent leaves and showy inflorescences, which are typical of the Liliaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Ornithogalum carpaticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
