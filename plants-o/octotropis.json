    "intro": "Octotropis, commonly known as the blue oatgrass, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, blue to gray-green leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The flowers are usually inconspicuous, forming small clusters at the ends of the stems, and are wind-pollinated. Octotropis species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in open habitats such as meadows and sandy soils. These plants are generally low-growing and have a clump-forming growth habit, making them suitable for ornamental and ecological landscaping."
