    "intro": "Oxalis obliquifolia var. eminii, commonly known as the eminii oxalis, is a strikingly ornamental plant native to South Africa. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a distinctive waxy coating that gives them a silvery sheen. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and containers."
