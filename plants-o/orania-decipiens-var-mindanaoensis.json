It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and the presence of several lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive spurred lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
