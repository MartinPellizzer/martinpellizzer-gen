    "intro": "Ornithogalum sordidum, commonly known as the stinking nightshade, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its underground bulbs and strap-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts specific pollinators. Ornithogalum sordidum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
