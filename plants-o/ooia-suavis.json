    "intro": "Ooia suavis, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that emit a sweet, intoxicating fragrance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Ooia suavis is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its cultural significance in traditional medicine."
