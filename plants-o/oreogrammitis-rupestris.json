    "intro": "Oreogrammitis rupestris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in rocky, shaded environments. It has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of its fronds. It is often found growing on limestone or sandstone surfaces in temperate regions. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
