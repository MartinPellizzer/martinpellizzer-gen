    "intro": "Olearia arborescens, commonly known as the tree dandelion, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a shrub or small tree with silver-gray, hairy leaves that are oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces fluffy, yellowish flower heads that resemble dandelion blooms, which are pollinated by insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Olearia arborescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native insect populations."
