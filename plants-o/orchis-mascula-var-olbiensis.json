    "intro": "Orchis mascula var. olbiensis, commonly known as the Olbiense Heath Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish flowers, which bloom in late spring and early summer. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor, acidic soils, often in open woodland or heathland habitats. Its morphology includes a compact growth habit with a single stem and a few leaves, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
