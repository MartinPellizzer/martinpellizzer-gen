    "intro": "Odina welwitschii, commonly known as the welwitschia, is a unique plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia. It is characterized by its two large, leathery leaves that can grow up to 4 meters in length. The plant has a thick, woody trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in the arid environment. It produces small, yellow flowers and is adapted to extreme conditions with a slow growth rate. Odina welwitschii is considered a living fossil, with a lineage dating back millions of years."
