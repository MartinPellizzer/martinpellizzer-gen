    "intro": "Orthophytum ulei, commonly known as the Ulei Sword Fern, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding structure. The plant produces striking orange-red bracts that enclose its small, white flowers. Orthophytum ulei thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of tropical forests. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and botanical collections."
