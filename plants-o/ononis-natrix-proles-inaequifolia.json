    "intro": "Ononis natrix proles inaequifolia, commonly known as the unequal-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, fleshy, opposite leaves that are often unequal in size, giving it its specific epithet. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its succulent leaves help it retain moisture in dry environments."
