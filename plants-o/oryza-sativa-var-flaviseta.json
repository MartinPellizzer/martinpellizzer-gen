    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. flaviseta, commonly known as the golden rice variety, is a type of rice characterized by its unique yellow grain color due to the presence of carotenoids. It is a member of the grass family, Poaceae, and is cultivated for its nutritional value, particularly its high content of beta-carotene. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 1.5 meters, with slender stems and broad, flat leaves. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, requiring warm temperatures and abundant sunlight for optimal growth. This variety has been developed to address vitamin A deficiency in populations that rely heavily on rice as a staple food."
