    "intro": "Orchis mediterranea subsp. siciliensis, commonly known as the Sicilian orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in southern Italy. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its tall, slender stem and showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing intricate, lip-shaped petals that are adapted for pollination by specific insects. Its habitat is usually rocky or calcareous soils, often in open woodlands or along coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
