    "intro": "Oreorchis gracillima, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. The plant has a delicate appearance with narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, slender flower spike that bears a single, fragrant orchid flower. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinctive lip that is often darker. Oreorchis gracillima is known for its subtle beauty and is often overlooked due to its modest size and inconspicuous appearance."
