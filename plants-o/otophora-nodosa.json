    "intro": "Otophora nodosa, commonly known as the nodular lichen, is a saxicolous lichen that thrives on rocky substrates. It belongs to the family Lecanoraceae and is characterized by its dense, foliose thallus with a distinctive nodular structure. The plant exhibits a dark green to blackish upper cortex and a pale yellow to white medulla. It is typically found in temperate and boreal regions, often on siliceous rocks. Otophora nodosa plays a role in soil stabilization and serves as a bioindicator of environmental conditions."
