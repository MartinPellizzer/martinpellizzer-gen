    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 crocii, commonly known as the honey orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance and scent of female bees, a feature known as pseudocopulation. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are predominantly yellow with brown and orange markings, and they bloom in late spring to early summer. Ophrys \u00d7 crocii is valued for its ornamental beauty and plays a role in local pollination dynamics due to its unique floral morphology."
