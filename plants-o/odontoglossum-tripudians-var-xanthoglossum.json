    "intro": "Odontoglossum tripudians var. xanthoglossum, commonly known as the golden-lipped orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that feature a distinctive golden-yellow lip, which sets it apart from other members of the Odontoglossum genus. The plant typically grows in cool, humid environments, often in montane cloud forests, where it thrives in partial shade. Its pseudobulbs are short and stout, supporting a single leaf that is broad and lance-shaped. The species is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its vibrant coloration and elegant floral structure."
