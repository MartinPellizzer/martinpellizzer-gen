    "intro": "Ostryoderris, commonly known as the black rust fungus, is a plant pathogen that primarily affects members of the genus *Ostrya*, which includes species like the American hornbeam. It causes a distinctive rust disease characterized by the formation of orange spore pustules on the leaves. The fungus has a complex life cycle involving two host plants, one of which is typically a *Ostrya* species. It thrives in moist, humid conditions and can lead to defoliation and reduced growth in infected trees. Management often involves removing infected plant material and improving air circulation around the host plants."
