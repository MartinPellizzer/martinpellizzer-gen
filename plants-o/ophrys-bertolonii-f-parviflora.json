    "intro": "Ophrys bertolonii f. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and prefers open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in deception. This orchid is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its specialized pollination mechanism."
