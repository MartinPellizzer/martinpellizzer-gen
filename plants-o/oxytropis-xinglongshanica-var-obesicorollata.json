It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, typical of many legumes. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
