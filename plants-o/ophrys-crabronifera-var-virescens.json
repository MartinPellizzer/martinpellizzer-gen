    "intro": "Ophrys crabronifera var. virescens, commonly known as the green bee orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its greenish-yellow flowers that closely resemble a wasp, a feature that aids in pollination by bees. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers. The species is noted for its specialized pollination mechanism, where the flower's structure mimics the appearance and scent of a female wasp."
