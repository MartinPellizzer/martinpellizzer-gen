It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers with a distinctive yellowish-green throat. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodlands and meadows across Europe. It has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
