    "intro": "Orbignya oleifera, commonly known as the babassu palm, is a flowering plant native to the Amazon Basin of South America. It is a tall, slender palm tree that can reach heights of up to 20 meters. The plant produces large, clustered inflorescences that bear yellowish flowers, which eventually develop into hard-shelled fruits. The seeds inside the fruits are encased in a fibrous husk and are often used for oil extraction. This species is valued for its economic and ecological importance in tropical ecosystems."
