It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers are notable for their vivid coloration and complex patterns, which play a crucial role in its pollination strategy. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
