    "intro": "Obione verrucifera, commonly known as the rough-skin fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often covered in a rough, waxy texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
