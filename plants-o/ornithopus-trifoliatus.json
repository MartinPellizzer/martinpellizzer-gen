It is characterized by its basal rosette of trifoliate leaves, which are typically gray-green in color and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry meadows and rocky areas. Ornithopus trifoliatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
