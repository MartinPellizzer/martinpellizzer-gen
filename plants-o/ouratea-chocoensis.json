    "intro": "Ouratea chocoensis, commonly known as the Chocoan Ouratea, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Ochnaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments and can reach heights of up to 15 meters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
