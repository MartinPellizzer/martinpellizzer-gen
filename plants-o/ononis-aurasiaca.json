    "intro": "Ononis aurasiaca, commonly known as the aurasiac sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor, sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which reduce water loss. Ononis aurasiaca is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
