    "intro": "Ophira, commonly known as the desert lily, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asparagaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. The plants typically have succulent leaves and produce showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red. They are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. Ophira species are often used in xeriscaping due to their low water requirements and ornamental value."
