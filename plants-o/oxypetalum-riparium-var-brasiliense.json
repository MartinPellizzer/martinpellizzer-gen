It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as rivers and lakes. The plant features broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are showy, with white petals and yellow stamens, and bloom during the warmer months. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
