    "intro": "Oenanthe grandisecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water-dropwort, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. The plant features slender, upright stems with finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in early summer. Oenanthe grandisecta is often found in wetland habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in garden settings."
