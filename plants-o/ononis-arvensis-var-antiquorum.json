    "intro": "Ononis arvensis var. antiquorum, commonly known as the ancient field bean or field vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, cylindrical pods containing several kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. This variety is notable for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a forage plant."
