    "intro": "Oxalis multibulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of delicate, yellow flowers. The plant produces multiple bulb-like structures underground, which aid in its propagation and survival. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun exposure. Oxalis multibulbosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in gardens."
