    "intro": "Onobrychis saravschanica, commonly known as the Saratov burclover, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across its native range."
