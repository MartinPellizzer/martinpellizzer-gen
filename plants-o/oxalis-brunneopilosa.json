    "intro": "Oxalis brunneopilosa, commonly known as the brown-hairy wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It features trifoliate leaves with a reddish-brown pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its foliage and flowers are edible, though it contains oxalic acid, so consumption should be cautious."
