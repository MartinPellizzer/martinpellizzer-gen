    "intro": "Ophrys tenthredinifera var. korae, commonly known as the Korean bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Korea. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with intricate patterns and a specialized lip that attracts male bees for pseudocopulation. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forested areas with rich, humus-filled soil. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this variety is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
