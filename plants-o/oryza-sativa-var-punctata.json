    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. punctata, commonly known as the dotted rice or spotted rice, is a lesser-known variant of rice characterized by its unique grain morphology. The grains exhibit distinct punctate markings, which are small, raised dots on the surface, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variety is primarily cultivated in specific regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in tropical climates. Its botanical features include slender, cylindrical grains and a husk that is typically lighter in color compared to common rice varieties. While not widely consumed as a staple food, it holds significance in botanical studies and traditional agriculture."
