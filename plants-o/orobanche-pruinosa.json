    "intro": "Orobanche pruinosa, commonly known as the pruinose broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is found in various regions of Europe and parts of Asia, often growing in open, disturbed habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers clustered in a dense, spike-like inflorescence. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific host species, primarily those in the legume family. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
