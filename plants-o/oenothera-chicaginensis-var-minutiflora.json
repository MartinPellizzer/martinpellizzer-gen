    "intro": "Oenothera chicaginensis var. minutiflora, commonly known as the Chicago evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the Midwestern United States. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats like prairies and roadsides, and it has slender, hairy stems with lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are relatively small compared to other evening primrose species, hence the variety name *minutiflora*. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds."
