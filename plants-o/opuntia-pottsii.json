    "intro": "Opuntia pottsii, commonly known as the Potts' prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, pad-like stems, which are covered in small, spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and has a sweet, juicy flavor. Opuntia pottsii is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
