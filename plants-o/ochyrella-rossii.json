    "intro": "Ochyrella rossii, commonly known as the Ross's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the wet tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, often in the shade of the dense forest canopy. The plant has a short, hairy stem and produces a single, elongated flower with a unique, intricate structure. It is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often growing near streams or in shaded understorey areas. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Ochyrella rossii is considered a vulnerable species."
