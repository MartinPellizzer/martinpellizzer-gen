    "intro": "Opuntia pentlandii, commonly known as the Penland prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and are often ribbed. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, spherical fruits. Opuntia pentlandii thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to hot, dry conditions. Its structure and growth patterns make it a notable species within the Opuntia genus."
