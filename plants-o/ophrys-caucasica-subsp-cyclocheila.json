    "intro": "Ophrys caucasica subsp. cyclocheila, commonly known as the Caucasian bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, thriving in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its specialized ecological requirements and limited distribution."
