    "intro": "Odontites litoralis, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by spiny bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it typically grows in low, compact clusters. Odontites litoralis is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems."
