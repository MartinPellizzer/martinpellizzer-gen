    "intro": "Orthocarpus castillejoides var. typicus, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a robust, branching stem that often rises to heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant is characterized by its fibrous root system, which helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils."
