    "intro": "Orobanche minor f. euglossa, commonly known as the lesser broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish to reddish stem and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in association with grasses and other herbaceous plants. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is considered a hemiparasite, meaning it can photosynthesize to a limited extent. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact its host plants, particularly in agricultural settings."
