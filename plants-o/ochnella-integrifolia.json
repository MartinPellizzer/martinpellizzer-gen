    "intro": "Ochnella integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leaved ochna, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features simple, elliptical leaves that are typically smooth and glossy on both sides. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its fruits are woody capsules that split open to release seeds. Ochnella integrifolia is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to coastal and inland environments."
