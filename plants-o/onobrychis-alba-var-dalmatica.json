    "intro": "Onobrychis alba var. dalmatica, commonly known as the Dalmatian burr vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Balkans. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
