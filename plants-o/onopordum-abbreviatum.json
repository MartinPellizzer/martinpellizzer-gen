It features a robust root system and a tall, branched stem covered in spiny, gray-green leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are followed by purple, spiky seed heads. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Its botanical characteristics make it an important plant for pollinators and a resilient species in arid environments."
