    "intro": "Orchis dolichorhiza, commonly known as the long-rooted orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers arranged in a loose spike, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its roots are long and fibrous, adapted for anchoring in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Orchis dolichorhiza is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks, thriving in temperate climates."
