    "intro": "Oxalis cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood sorrel, is a species of flowering plant in the family Oxalidaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant produces bead-like seed pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Oxalis cuneifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening due to its delicate appearance and ease of cultivation."
