    "intro": "Odontoglossum, commonly known as the toothed tongue orchid, is a genus of orchids native to the Andes Mountains of South America. These plants are characterized by their intricate, often fragrant flowers with distinctive tooth-like markings on the lip. They typically grow in high-altitude cloud forests, where they thrive in cool, humid conditions. Odontoglossum species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on trees without deriving nutrients from them. Their botanical significance lies in their unique floral structures and their role in the biodiversity of their native habitats."
