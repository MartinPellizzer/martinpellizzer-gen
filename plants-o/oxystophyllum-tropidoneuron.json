    "intro": "Oxystophyllum tropidoneuron, commonly known as the narrow-leafed cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that are typically dark green and narrow in shape. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires a warm, tropical climate to flourish. Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
