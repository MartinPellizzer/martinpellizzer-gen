    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 montis-lorae, commonly known as the Alpine bee orchid, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in well-drained, calcareous soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects. This species is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism, relying on male bees that attempt to mate with the flower's pseudocopulatory structures."
