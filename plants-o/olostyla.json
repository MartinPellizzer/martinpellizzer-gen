    "intro": "Olostyla, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a halophytic shrub native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant has a complex root system, including pneumatophores, which allow it to absorb oxygen from the waterlogged soil. Olostyla plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing erosion. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds."
