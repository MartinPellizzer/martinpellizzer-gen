    "intro": "Oleandra scandens, commonly known as the climbing oleander, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy clusters of pink to red flowers, which bloom throughout the growing season. Oleandra scandens is known for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in full sun. However, it is considered toxic due to the presence of cardiac glycosides in its leaves and flowers."
