    "intro": "Onobrychis supina var. intermedia, commonly known as creeping burclover, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the southwestern United States. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its trifoliate leaves are hairy and have a distinctive, slightly heart-shaped base. It is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
