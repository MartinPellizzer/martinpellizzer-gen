    "intro": "Oldenlandia rosulata, commonly known as the Rosulate Spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of fleshy, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories or along streambanks. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in humid climates."
