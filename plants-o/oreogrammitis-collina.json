    "intro": "Oreogrammitis collina, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, delicate fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit and finely divided, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates, such as cliffs or walls, where it forms dense mats. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered near the leaf tips. Oreogrammitis collina is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
