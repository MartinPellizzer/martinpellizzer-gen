    "intro": "Omphalodes rupestris, commonly known as the rock scabious, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine regions. The plant features small, clustered blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. Omphalodes rupestris is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
