    "intro": "Oldenlandia asperula, commonly known as the prostrate milkweed or spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant has slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread easily. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and slightly hairy, with a rough texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along stream banks."
