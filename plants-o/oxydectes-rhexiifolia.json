    "intro": "Oxydectes rhexiifolia, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped stems that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are fleshy and arranged alternately along the stems, providing efficient storage of water. Oxydectes rhexiifolia is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a hardy addition to xeriscaping gardens."
