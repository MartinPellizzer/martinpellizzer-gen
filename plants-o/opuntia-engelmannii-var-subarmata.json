    "intro": "Opuntia engelmannii var. subarmata, commonly known as the Engelmann's prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features flat, spineless stems that are often ribbed and covered in a layer of white, powdery bloom. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are modified into flat, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant is adapted to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping."
