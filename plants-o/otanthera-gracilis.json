    "intro": "Otanthera gracilis, commonly known as slender false aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, covered with fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white to pale purple, typically blooming from mid-summer to early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly toothed, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Otanthera gracilis thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands or along streambanks."
