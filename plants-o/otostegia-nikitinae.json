    "intro": "Otostegia nikitinae, commonly known as the Nikitina's otostegia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine environments. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and it produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind. Otostegia nikitinae is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to harsh, high-altitude conditions."
