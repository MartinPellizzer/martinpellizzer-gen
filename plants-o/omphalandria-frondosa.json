    "intro": "Omphalandria frondosa, commonly known as the fronded fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish itself in suitable habitats. Its leaves are bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in attracting pollinators at night. This plant plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native regions by providing shelter and food for various small organisms."
