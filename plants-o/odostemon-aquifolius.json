    "intro": "Odostemon aquifolius, commonly known as the silverleaf mallow, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid environments. Odostemon aquifolius is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and drought tolerance."
