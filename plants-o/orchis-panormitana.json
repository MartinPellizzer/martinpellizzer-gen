    "intro": "Orchis panormitana, commonly known as the Panormitana orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Pantelleria in Italy. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family, characterized by its intricate and showy floral structure. The plant typically grows in rocky, calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its flowers are usually violet or purple in color, with a distinctive hooded labellum that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a protected and vulnerable species."
