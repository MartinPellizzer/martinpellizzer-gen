    "intro": "Orobanche spicata, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its yellowish or reddish stem. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pink in color. It is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often growing in disturbed soils. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the growth of its host plants, particularly those in the legume family."
