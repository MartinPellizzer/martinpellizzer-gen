    "intro": "Oncidium cruciatum, commonly known as the Crossed Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, fragrant flowers that often display a striking combination of yellow, orange, and red hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Oncidium cruciatum is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in cultivation."
