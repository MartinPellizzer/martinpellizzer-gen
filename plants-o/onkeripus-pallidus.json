    "intro": "Onkeripus pallidus, commonly known as the pale lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree bark or rocks in temperate regions. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the mutualistic relationship between the fungal and algal components. It plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its habitat. Due to its delicate nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is often used as an indicator of air quality."
