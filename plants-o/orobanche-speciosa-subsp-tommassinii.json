    "intro": "Orobanche speciosa subsp. tommassinii, commonly known as the showy broomrape, is a hemiparasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to regions of North America, particularly in the western United States. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, which attract pollinators. It typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in association with grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth of its host species."
