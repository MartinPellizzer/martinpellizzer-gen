    "intro": "Oocephalus nubicola, commonly known as the cloud forest fern, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,000 and 3,000 meters. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit with fronds that are pinnately compound and often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores for propagation. The botanical features of Oocephalus nubicola make it well adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its natural habitat."
