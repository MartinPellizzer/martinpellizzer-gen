    "intro": "Onobrychis argentea var. longidentata, commonly known as silver vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves with a dense covering of fine hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in racemes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
