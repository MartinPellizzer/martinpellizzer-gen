    "intro": "Oplismenus muricatus, commonly known as the creeping indigo or false indigo, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features a sprawling growth habit with slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in late spring, which are borne on slender pedicels. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly rough texture due to tiny, stiff hairs. Oplismenus muricatus is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
