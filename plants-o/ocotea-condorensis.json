    "intro": "Ocotea condorensis, commonly known as the Peruvian laurel, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves and smooth, grayish bark. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within cloud forests, reaching heights of up to 20 meters. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it produces dark, fleshy berries that serve as a food source for various wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
