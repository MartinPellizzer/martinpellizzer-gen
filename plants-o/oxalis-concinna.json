It features trifoliate leaves composed of three heart-shaped leaflets, and small, delicate flowers that range from white to pink or yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stems are often hairy, and it produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds. Oxalis concinna is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in partial shade."
