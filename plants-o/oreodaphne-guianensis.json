    "intro": "Oreodaphne guianensis, commonly known as Guianese oreodaphne, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly found in Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and smooth, greyish bark. The plant typically grows in moist, lowland forests and can reach heights of up to 30 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy surface, while its flowers are small and clustered in catkins. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild."
