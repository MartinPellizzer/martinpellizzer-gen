    "intro": "Othonna campanulata, commonly known as the blue oxalis, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that resemble small bells, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Othonna campanulata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
