    "intro": "Orobanche minor var. leucanthemi, commonly known as the whiteflower dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow to white flowers and slender, thread-like stems. This species typically parasitizes various plants in the Asteraceae and Fabaceae families. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a persistent weed in agricultural settings. The plant's reproductive strategy involves producing small, dry seeds that can remain viable in the soil for many years."
