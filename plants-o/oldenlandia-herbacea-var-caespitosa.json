    "intro": "Oldenlandia herbacea var. caespitosa, commonly known as the creeping spiderwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland understories or along stream banks."
