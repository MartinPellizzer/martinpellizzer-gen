    "intro": "Ornithogalum sphaerolobum, commonly known as the globe lily, is a bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that resemble small globes. The plant is characterized by its underground bulbs, which store nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a striking visual element to the garden."
