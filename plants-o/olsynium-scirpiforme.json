    "intro": "Olsynium scirpiforme, commonly known as the narrowleaf water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often floating or semi-submerged, with a smooth, waxy surface. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in dense spikes and are pollinated by wind. Olsynium scirpiforme plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
