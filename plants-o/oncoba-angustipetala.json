    "intro": "Oncoba angustipetala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved oncoba, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are often borne on the previous year's wood. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Oncoba angustipetala is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
