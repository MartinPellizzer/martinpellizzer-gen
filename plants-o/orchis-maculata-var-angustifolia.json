    "intro": "Orchis maculata var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spotted orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces tall, spike-like inflorescences with showy, purple-tinged flowers. The flowers are typically bilaterally symmetrical, with a distinctive spur that houses nectar, attracting specific pollinators. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. This orchid is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
