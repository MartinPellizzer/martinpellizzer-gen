    "intro": "Ophrys spruneri subsp. panormitana, commonly known as the Panormitana bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
