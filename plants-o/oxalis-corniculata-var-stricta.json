    "intro": "Oxalis corniculata var. stricta, commonly known as the spurred wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to Asia and Australia. It is a low-growing perennial with trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers that resemble those of the common wood sorrel. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
