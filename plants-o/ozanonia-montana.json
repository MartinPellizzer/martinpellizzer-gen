    "intro": "Ozanonia montana, commonly known as mountain ozanonia, is a perennial herb native to the northern United States and Canada. It typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as stream banks and woodland edges. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowering stems rise above the foliage, producing small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike. Ozanonia montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens."
