    "intro": "Ornithocephalus longilabris, commonly known as the long-lipped orchid, is a herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated labellum that resembles a bird's beak, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, often arranged in clusters along the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
