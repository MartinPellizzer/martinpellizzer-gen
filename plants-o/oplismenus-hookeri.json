It features a rosette of thick, silver-blue, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces striking white or pink flowers in late spring or early summer, which are borne on tall, branching stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a distinctive addition to Mediterranean-style landscapes."
