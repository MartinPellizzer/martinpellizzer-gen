    "intro": "Orchis ustulata var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered twayblade, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically pale pink to purple in color, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
