    "intro": "Oreodaphne lindeniana, commonly known as the Malayan ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, often greyish bark. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood used in construction and furniture-making. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
