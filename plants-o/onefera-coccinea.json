    "intro": "Onefera coccinea, commonly known as the red-flowered orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red petals and elongated, slender leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Onefera coccinea thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
