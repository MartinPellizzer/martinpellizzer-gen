    "intro": "Oncidium velutinum, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a tropical orchid species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of fragrant, yellow-green flowers with prominent purple markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Oncidium velutinum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
