    "intro": "Oplismenus barbifultus, commonly known as the hairy nettle, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with hairy undersides, and its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense spikes. Oplismenus barbifultus is known for its stinging hairs, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
