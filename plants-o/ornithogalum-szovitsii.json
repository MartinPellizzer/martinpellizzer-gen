    "intro": "Ornithogalum szovitsii, commonly known as the Szovits's star-of-Bethleem, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette, while the flower stalks rise above the foliage. Ornithogalum szovitsii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
