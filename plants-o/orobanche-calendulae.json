    "intro": "Orobanche calendulae, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a root system composed of haustoria, which penetrate the host plant's vascular system. The plant is often found growing on the stems of other plants, particularly those in the sunflower family. It is widely distributed across Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and is considered a weed in agricultural settings. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host plants and reduce crop yields."
