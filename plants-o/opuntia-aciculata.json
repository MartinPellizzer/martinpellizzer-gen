    "intro": "Opuntia aciculata, commonly known as the needle prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its flat, spineless pads and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its pads can be eaten when fully mature, though they contain a mild, slightly sour taste. Opuntia aciculata plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
