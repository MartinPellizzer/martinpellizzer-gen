    "intro": "Ophioglossum vulgatum var. surinamense, commonly known as the Surinam adder's-tongue, is a member of the Ophioglossaceae family. It is a rare and ancient fern-like plant characterized by its unique, tongue-shaped spore-bearing structure called a sporophyll. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually long and narrow, with a distinct, primitive morphology. This variety is noted for its limited distribution and is considered a relict species with significant botanical interest."
