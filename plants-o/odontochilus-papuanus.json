    "intro": "Odontochilus papuanus, commonly known as the Papuan toothed orchid, is a rare and highly specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of New Guinea. It is characterized by its unique toothed lip, which is a distinguishing feature among orchids. The plant typically grows as a small epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its native habitat. Its flowers are usually small and greenish-white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment."
