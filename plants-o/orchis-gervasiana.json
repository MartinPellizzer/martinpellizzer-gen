    "intro": "Orchis gervasiana, commonly known as the Gervasian orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of Italy. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
