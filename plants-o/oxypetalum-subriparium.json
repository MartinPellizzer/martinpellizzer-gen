    "intro": "Oxypetalum subriparium, commonly known as the narrowleaf oxypetalum, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, with a serrated margin, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by water. Oxypetalum subriparium is often found in association with other wetland flora and plays a role in supporting local ecosystems."
