    "intro": "Ochrocarpos excelsus, commonly known as the yellow-flowered lichen, is a unique lichen species characterized by its distinctive yellowish-orange thallus. It belongs to the family Trapeliaceae and is primarily found on rock surfaces in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions. Its morphology includes a crust-like growth pattern with dense, interwoven filaments. Ochrocarpos excelsus is often used as an indicator species for environmental health due to its sensitivity to air pollution."
