    "intro": "Odontotrichum globosum, commonly known as the globular hairgrass, is a small, annual grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact, globular growth habit and produces tiny, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture, and it has a short, fibrous root system. Odontotrichum globosum is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
