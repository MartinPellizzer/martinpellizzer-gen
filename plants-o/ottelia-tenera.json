    "intro": "Ottelia tenera, commonly known as the water bladderwort, is a semi-aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, arranged in spikes. Its roots are adapted for anchoring in aquatic or wetland environments. Ottelia tenera is known for its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving water, making it a common sight in ponds and marshes."
