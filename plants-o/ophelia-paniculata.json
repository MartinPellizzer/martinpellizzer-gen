    "intro": "Ophelia paniculata, commonly known as the water poppy, is a semi-aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands. The plant features broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in buoyancy. Its flowers are yellow and clustered in panicles, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Ophelia paniculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
