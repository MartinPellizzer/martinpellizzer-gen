    "intro": "Oreoselinum austriacum, commonly known as the Austrian cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to Central Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which disperse its seeds through the wind. Oreoselinum austriacum is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it thrives in cooler climates."
