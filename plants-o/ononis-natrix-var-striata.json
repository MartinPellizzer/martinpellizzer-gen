    "intro": "Ononis natrix var. striata, commonly known as the striped bedstraw, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, opposite leaves with a distinctive striated appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows, roadsides, and rocky areas. Its fibrous roots and creeping growth habit make it a hardy, adaptable species that is sometimes used in erosion control."
