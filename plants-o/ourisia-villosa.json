    "intro": "Ourisia villosa, commonly known as the hairy ourisia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of delicate, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained, acidic soils. Ourisia villosa is often found in coastal and mountainous habitats, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
