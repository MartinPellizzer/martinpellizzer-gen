    "intro": "Oreopanax dactylifolius, commonly known as the star-leaf arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately compound leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Its roots are valued for their starchy, edible qualities, similar to those of traditional arrowroot. The species is often cultivated for both ornamental and culinary purposes due to its unique appearance and useful properties."
