    "intro": "Ornithogalum tenuifolium var. propinquum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. The plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is characterized by its bulbous root system, which stores nutrients and water for periods of drought. This variety is closely related to other species in the Ornithogalum genus, sharing similar morphological traits and ecological preferences."
