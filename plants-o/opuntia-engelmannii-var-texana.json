    "intro": "Opuntia engelmannii var. texana, commonly known as the Texas prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, spine-tipped pads and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and has been used by indigenous peoples for food and medicine. The plant plays an important ecological role in desert ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
