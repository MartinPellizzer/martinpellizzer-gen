    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia f. remota, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and distinctive, pale purple to white flowers with a yellowish lip. This form is a natural variant of Orchis angustifolia, distinguished by its more elongated leaves and reduced floral structures. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils, often in woodland or heathland environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
