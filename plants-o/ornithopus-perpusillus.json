    "intro": "Ornithopus perpusillus, commonly known as the dwarf flax or small flax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a low-growing annual herb that typically reaches heights of only a few inches. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it often grows in dry, sandy soils. Ornithopus perpusillus is valued in native plant gardens for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
