    "intro": "Oenothera perampla, commonly known as the swamp evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in moist environments. Oenothera perampla is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in full to partial sunlight and is adapted to water-saturated soils."
