    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia f. obtusifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a rare and distinctive member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and a striking violet or purple flower spike that bears small, tubular flowers. This orchid is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream sides. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
