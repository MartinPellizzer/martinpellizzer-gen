    "intro": "Onobrychis megalophylla, commonly known as large-leaf burclover, is a perennial legume native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves with large, ovate leaflets and yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils and withstand drought conditions. It is often found in grasslands and open woodlands, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria. Its foliage is sometimes used in livestock feed, though it is generally considered a weed in agricultural settings."
