    "intro": "Oplotheca decumbens, commonly known as the creeping oplotheca, is a low-growing shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate or decumbent stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the wet season. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a rough texture with a slightly hairy surface. Oplotheca decumbens is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
