    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza grandibracteolata, commonly known as the large-bract Ophiorrhiza, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and showy, white to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and swampy areas. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. Ophiorrhiza grandibracteolata is also notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it an important component of tropical ecosystems."
