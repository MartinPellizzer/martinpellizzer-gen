    "intro": "Orobanche salviae subsp. echinopis, commonly known as the echinopis broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing members of the Lamiaceae family. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often white or pale in color. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific host species, making it a specialized and ecologically significant plant in certain habitats. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is often considered a rare or endangered species in many regions."
