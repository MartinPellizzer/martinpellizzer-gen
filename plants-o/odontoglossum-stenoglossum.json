    "intro": "Odontoglossum stenoglossum, commonly known as the narrow-lipped orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow petals and a distinctive, narrow labellum that gives it its specific epithet. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale green to white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Odontoglossum stenoglossum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
