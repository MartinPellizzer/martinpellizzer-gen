    "intro": "Oplismenus foliaceus, commonly known as silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, which bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a small, smooth, fleshy berry that turns red when mature. Oplismenus foliaceus is often found in moist, wooded areas and can spread aggressively through rhizomes."
