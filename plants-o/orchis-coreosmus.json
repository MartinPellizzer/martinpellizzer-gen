    "intro": "Orchis coreosmus, commonly known as the blue flag orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are grass-like and lance-shaped, often forming a dense rosette at the base. The orchid has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological significance in wetland ecosystems."
