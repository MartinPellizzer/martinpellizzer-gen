    "intro": "Odontadenia lauretiana, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces woody capsules containing numerous small, dark seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and the rarity of its habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species."
