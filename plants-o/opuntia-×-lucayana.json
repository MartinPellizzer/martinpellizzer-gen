It features flat, fleshy stems that are typically green to reddish in color, covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, fleshy fruits called tunas. Its stems are succulent and store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Opuntia \u00d7 lucayana is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
