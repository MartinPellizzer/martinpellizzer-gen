    "intro": "Orucaria, commonly known as the \"arauca\u00f1a\" or \"arauca palm,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Arecaceae. It is native to South America, particularly found in regions of Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. Orucaria species are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their striking appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, they are relatively slow-growing and require specific care to flourish."
