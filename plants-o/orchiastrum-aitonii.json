    "intro": "Orchiastrum aitonii, commonly known as the Aiton's orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Vietnam and Laos. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, with a unique floral structure that includes a spurred lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to habitat destruction, Orchiastrum aitonii is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
