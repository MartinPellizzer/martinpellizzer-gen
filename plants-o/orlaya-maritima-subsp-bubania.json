    "intro": "Orlaya maritima subsp. bubania, commonly known as the coastal orlaya, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Papaveraceae family, characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, thriving in saline and well-drained environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The subspecies bubania is distinguished by its slightly different floral morphology and habitat preferences compared to the main species."
