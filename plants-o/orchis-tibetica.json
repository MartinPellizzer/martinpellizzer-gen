    "intro": "Orchis tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant thrives in cold, alpine environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its flowers are often pollinated by bees and other insects, and it plays a role in the local ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
