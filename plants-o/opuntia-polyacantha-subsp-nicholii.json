    "intro": "Opuntia polyacantha subsp. nicholii, commonly known as the narrow-leafed prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, spiny stems that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and the stems serve as the primary photosynthetic organs. This species is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
