    "intro": "Onosma saxatilis, commonly known as the rock onion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and arid regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as limestone cliffs and gravelly soils. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces striking violet or purple flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are clustered in dense, umbel-like inflorescences, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Onosma saxatilis is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
