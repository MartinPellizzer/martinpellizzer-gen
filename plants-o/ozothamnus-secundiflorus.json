    "intro": "Ozothamnus secundiflorus, commonly known as the coastal goldenbush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and wind exposure. Ozothamnus secundiflorus plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for native wildlife."
