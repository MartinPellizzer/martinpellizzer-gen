    "intro": "Orchis laxiflora lusus longebracteata, commonly known as the long-bracted orchid, is a rare and fascinating member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and distinctive, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas across parts of Europe. Its unique floral structure includes a spurred lip, which is a hallmark of many orchid species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in certain regions."
