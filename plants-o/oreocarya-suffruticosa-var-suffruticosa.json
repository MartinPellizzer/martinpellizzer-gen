    "intro": "Oreocarya suffruticosa var. suffruticosa, commonly known as the alpine buckthorn, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in subalpine or alpine habitats. The plant features dense, woody stems covered with small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually gray-green in color. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and appear in clusters, while the berries are dark red and toxic to humans and animals. This species is adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
