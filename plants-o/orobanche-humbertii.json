    "intro": "Orobanche humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and North Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle that involves germination dependent on specific host species. Its roots form haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
