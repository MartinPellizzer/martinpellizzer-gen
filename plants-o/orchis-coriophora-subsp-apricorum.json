    "intro": "Orchis coriophora subsp. apricorum, commonly known as the apricot orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species found in specific alpine and subalpine habitats. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its flowers are often clustered in a loose spike and are pollinated by specialized insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
