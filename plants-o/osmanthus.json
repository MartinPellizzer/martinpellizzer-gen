    "intro": "Osmanthus, commonly known as sweet osmanthus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Oleaceae. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and is prized for its fragrant flowers and edible fruits. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with opposite, simple leaves and yellowish-green flowers that emit a sweet, aromatic scent. Osmanthus species are often cultivated for ornamental purposes and for the production of osmanthus oil and tea. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice in traditional Chinese horticulture and medicine."
