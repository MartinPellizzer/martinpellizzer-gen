    "intro": "Ottleya flexuosa, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and showy blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, bell-shaped blossoms that bloom in the spring. Ottleya flexuosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
