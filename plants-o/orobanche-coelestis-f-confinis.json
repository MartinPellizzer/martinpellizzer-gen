    "intro": "Orobanche coelestis f. confinis, commonly known as the sky-blue broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and small, usually white or pale blue flowers. This plant typically parasitizes members of the legume family, such as Vicia and Astragalus, and is found in temperate regions. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots. The subspecies confinis is distinguished by its more compact growth and slightly different floral morphology compared to the typical form."
