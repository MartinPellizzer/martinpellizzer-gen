    "intro": "Ophrys galeopsidea, commonly known as the green orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to parts of Europe, particularly in the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique, bee-like appearance, with a greenish-yellow flower that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually arranged in a loose raceme, with each bloom featuring a prominent lip that plays a key role in the pollination process. Ophrys galeopsidea is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its specialized reproductive strategy involving mimicry and pseudocopulation."
