    "intro": "Odontophorus alba-oculatus, commonly known as the white-eyed orchid, is a species of orchid native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, white petals with a distinctive yellowish eye-like marking, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its flowers are small but highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths. The botanical structure of the plant includes a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes and pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients."
