    "intro": "Orchidotypus bryophytus, commonly known as the moss orchid, is a unique hybrid plant that combines characteristics of both orchids and bryophytes. It exhibits the intricate floral structures typical of orchids, while its growth form resembles that of mosses, with small, clustered shoots. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in shaded forest floors or on damp rock surfaces. Its reproductive system involves both sexual and asexual methods, contributing to its adaptability. Due to its rare occurrence, it is considered a specialized species with limited geographical distribution."
