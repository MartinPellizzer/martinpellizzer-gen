    "intro": "Olfersia succisifolia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has modified stems that perform photosynthesis, making it a unique adaptation to its shaded habitat. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
