    "intro": "Ochrothallus schmidii, commonly known as the Schmid's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, elongated inflorescence and striking, pale yellow to orange flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree bark or in rocky crevices. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it has a complex relationship with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ochrothallus schmidii is considered a critically endangered species."
