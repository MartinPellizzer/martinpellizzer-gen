    "intro": "Onoseris brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved fleabane, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and rocky areas. Its leaves are short and densely arranged, often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. The flowers are usually yellow or white, and the plant produces small, dry fruits called achenes."
