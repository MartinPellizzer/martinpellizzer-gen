    "intro": "Ophrys apifera var. filitepala, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a striking orchid species characterized by its intricate floral morphology. The plant features a single, showy flower that closely resembles a bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of broad, leathery leaves that store moisture, adapting to its often dry habitat. The orchid thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny environments. Its unique pollination mechanism and striking appearance make it a notable species in botanical studies."
