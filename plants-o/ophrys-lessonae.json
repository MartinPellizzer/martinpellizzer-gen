    "intro": "Ophrys lessonae, commonly known as the lesson's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female wasp, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive lip that resembles the body of a wasp, attracting male wasps for pollination. Ophrys lessonae thrives in calcareous soils and requires specific microhabitats, often found in shaded, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts."
