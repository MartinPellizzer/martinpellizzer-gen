    "intro": "Opuntia boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian prickly pear, is a cactus species native to South America, particularly Bolivia and Argentina. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems called cladodes. These stems are covered in small spines and are adapted for photosynthesis, reducing water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia boliviana is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
