    "intro": "Opuntia aureispina, commonly known as the golden spine prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Central America. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in sharp spines and are often ribbed. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments. Opuntia aureispina is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous peoples."
