    "intro": "Onobrychis halacsyana, commonly known as the Hungarian clover, is a perennial legume native to southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. This species is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
