    "intro": "Ottelia lanceolata, commonly known as water buttercup, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and wetlands. The plant features floating leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its flowers are yellow and occur in clusters, often blooming in late summer. Ottelia lanceolata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water oxygenation."
