    "intro": "Osmunda dissecta, commonly known as the giant sweetflag, is a tall, fern-like plant native to wetlands and marshes in North America. It has a distinctive, sword-shaped frond that can grow up to 3 meters in height, with a feathery appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the undersides of its fronds. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber. Osmunda dissecta plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
