    "intro": "Oryza pumila, commonly known as dwarf rice, is a small-grained grass species native to Asia. It is characterized by its compact stature and reduced size compared to other rice species, typically growing to a height of less than 1 meter. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers and has slender, fibrous roots. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Oryza pumila is often found in wetland habitats and is considered a wild relative of cultivated rice."
