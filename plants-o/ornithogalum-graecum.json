    "intro": "Ornithogalum graecum, commonly known as the Greek star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking white or pale pink flowers in umbels during late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its underground bulbs, which store nutrients and aid in its survival through adverse conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Ornithogalum graecum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
