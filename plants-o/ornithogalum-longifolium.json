    "intro": "Ornithogalum longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved cowslip, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces umbellate inflorescences with white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its flowers have six petals and are often mistaken for true cowslips due to their similar appearance. Ornithogalum longifolium is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions."
