    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia f. anziensis, commonly known as the Anziensis Narrowleaf Orchid, is a rare botanical variant native to specific regions in Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, spike-like inflorescence bearing small, violet or purple flowers. The plant is typically found in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Its floral structure is typical of the Orchidaceae family, with three sepals and three petals, though the latter are often reduced. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in some areas."
