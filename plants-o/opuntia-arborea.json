    "intro": "Opuntia arborea, commonly known as the tree cactus, is a species native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a shrub-like cactus that can grow up to 10 meters tall, featuring a woody stem with multiple branches. Its stems are covered in spiny areoles, which bear clusters of cylindrical, spine-tipped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red fruits containing edible seeds. Opuntia arborea is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
