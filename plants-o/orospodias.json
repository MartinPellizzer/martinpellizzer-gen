    "intro": "Orospodias, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with long, strap-like leaves and a single, showy flower. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It requires specific environmental conditions, including high humidity and filtered sunlight, to thrive. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Orospodias is critically endangered and is protected in many regions."
