    "intro": "Orthochilus albobrunneus, commonly known as the white-brown orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a loose inflorescence, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
