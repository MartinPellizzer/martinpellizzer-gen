    "intro": "Ortholobium havilandii, commonly known as Haviland's legume, is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, and thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 feet, with compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated, leathery pods that split open to release the seeds. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
