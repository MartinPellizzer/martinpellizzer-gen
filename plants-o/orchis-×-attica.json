    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 attica, commonly known as the Greek orchid, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis anthropophora. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland habitats. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive spurred lip, which is a characteristic feature of the Orchidaceae family. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in regions of southern and central Europe. Due to its hybrid nature, Orchis \u00d7 attica exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on the parent species."
