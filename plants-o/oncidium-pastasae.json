    "intro": "Oncidium pastasae, commonly known as the pastasae orchid, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences bearing numerous small, colorful flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Oncidium pastasae is popular among orchid growers for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
