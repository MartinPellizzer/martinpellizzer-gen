    "intro": "Opuntia engelmannii var. cuija, commonly known as the Cuija prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are typically ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. The plant is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
