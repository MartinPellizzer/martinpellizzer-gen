    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. homochroma, commonly known as the glabrous rice, is a less commonly cultivated variant of rice characterized by its smooth, hairless surface. This variety is primarily distinguished by its reduced or absent leaf and stem pubescence, which sets it apart from other rice cultivars. Botanically, it belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is native to Southeast Asia, similar to other rice species. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 meter, with slender stalks and small, clustered inflorescences. Its grain is similar to other rice types but is often noted for its unique texture and potential use in specialty rice products."
