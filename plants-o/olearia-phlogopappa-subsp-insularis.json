    "intro": "Olearia phlogopappa subsp. insularis, commonly known as the Chatham Islands daisy, is a flowering plant native to the Chatham Islands of New Zealand. It is a herbaceous perennial with silver-green, woolly leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to the cool, maritime climate of its native habitat. It is typically found growing in coastal and lowland areas, often on sandy or rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
