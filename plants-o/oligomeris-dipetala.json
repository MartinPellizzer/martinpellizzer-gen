    "intro": "Oligomeris dipetala, commonly known as the two-petaled orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, intricately shaped flowers with two petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or mossy environments, thriving in cool and humid climates. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oligomeris dipetala is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
