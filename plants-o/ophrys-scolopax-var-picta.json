    "intro": "Ophrys scolopax var. picta, commonly known as the painted bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral structure, which features a vividly colored lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils in open woodland or grassland habitats. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a unique combination of color and scent. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
