It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions."
