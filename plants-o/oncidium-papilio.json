    "intro": "Oncidium papilio, commonly known as the butterfly orchid, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is a sympodial orchid with pseudobulbs that support its growth and storage of nutrients. The plant produces showy, butterfly-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with contrasting purple or red markings. Oncidium papilio thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure and vibrant colors make it a popular choice for both ornamental and horticultural purposes."
