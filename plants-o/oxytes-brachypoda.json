It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. The plant has a low-growing habit with short, stiff stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually pale blue or purple, appearing in clusters at the base of the plant. Oxytes brachypoda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
