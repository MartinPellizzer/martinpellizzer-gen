    "intro": "Ophrys oxyrrhynchos, commonly known as the narrow-lobed helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and its striking, bee-mimicking flowers that are often yellow or greenish in color. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest floors. Its flowers have a distinctive structure with a lip that resembles a female bee, aiding in pollination through mimicry. Ophrys oxyrrhynchos is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
