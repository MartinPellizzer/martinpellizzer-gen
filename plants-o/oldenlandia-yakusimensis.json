    "intro": "Oldenlandia yakusimensis, commonly known as the Yakushima starflower, is a flowering plant native to the island of Yakushima in Japan. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in the cool, humid climate. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a glossy texture, while its stems are slender and often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and unique ecological niche, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
