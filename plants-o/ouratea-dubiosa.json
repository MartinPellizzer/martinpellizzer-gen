    "intro": "Ouratea dubiosa, commonly known as the white starwood, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling stars, hence its common name. These flowers are typically followed by red or orange berries that contain several seeds. Ouratea dubiosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates."
