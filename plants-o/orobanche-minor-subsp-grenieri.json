    "intro": "Orobanche minor subsp. grenieri, commonly known as the dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields, where it can attach to a variety of host species. Its life cycle involves germinating near host roots and forming a haustorium to extract water and nutrients. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a role in shaping plant community dynamics in its native range."
