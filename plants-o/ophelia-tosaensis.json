    "intro": "Ophelia tosaensis, commonly known as the Tosa water-starwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to Japan. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, and is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves. The plant has small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the substrate in its aquatic habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophelia tosaensis is considered a vulnerable species."
