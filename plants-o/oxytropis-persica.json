    "intro": "Oxytropis persica, commonly known as Persian locoweed, is a flowering plant native to regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow to green pea-like flowers, and its leaves are compound, consisting of several small leaflets. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a noxious weed in some areas."
