    "intro": "Oxalis teretifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive white or yellowish pattern, and small, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is characterized by its succulent stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal regions. Oxalis teretifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
