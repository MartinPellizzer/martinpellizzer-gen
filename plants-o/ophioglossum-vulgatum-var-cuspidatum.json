    "intro": "Ophioglossum vulgatum var. cuspidatum, commonly known as the spurred adder's mouth, is a rare and ancient fern species characterized by its unique morphology. It features a short, thick rhizome with a single, narrow, lance-shaped leaf that has a distinctive spur-like structure at the base. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a dense, umbrella-like arrangement on the underside of the leaf. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
