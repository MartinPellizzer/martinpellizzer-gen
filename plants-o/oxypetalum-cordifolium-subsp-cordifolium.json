    "intro": "Oxypetalum cordifolium subsp. cordifolium, commonly known as the heartleaf oxypetalum, is a species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its elliptical, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable addition to botanical collections."
