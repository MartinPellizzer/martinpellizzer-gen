    "intro": "Osmanthus polyneurus, commonly known as the Chinese osmanthus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the autumn season. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter in color on the underside. Its flowers are widely used in traditional Chinese medicine and as a flavoring agent in teas and confections. Osmanthus polyneurus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and aromatic qualities."
