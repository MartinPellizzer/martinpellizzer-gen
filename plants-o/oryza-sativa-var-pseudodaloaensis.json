    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. pseudodaloaensis, commonly known as the Daloa rice, is a less common variety of rice native to West Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and small, slender grains. The plant typically grows in lowland areas with well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a panicle inflorescence that produces small, greenish-white florets. This variety is of interest to researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to local environmental conditions."
