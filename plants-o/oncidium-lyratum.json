    "intro": "Oncidium lyratum, commonly known as the \"Lyratum Orchid,\" is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, racemose inflorescence that bears numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, warm environments. Its leaves are strap-like and grassy, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Oncidium lyratum is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
