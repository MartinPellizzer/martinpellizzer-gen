    "intro": "Orchis incarnata var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved pink orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to moist woodlands and meadows in eastern North America. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces tall, erect flowering stems with showy, pinkish-purple flowers. The flowers are typically arranged in a loose spike and have a distinctive three-lobed lip. This variety is distinguished by its shorter leaves compared to the typical form of Orchis incarnata. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in shaded, damp environments."
