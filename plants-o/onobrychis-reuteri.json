    "intro": "Onobrychis reuteri, commonly known as the small burr medic, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are typically dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Onobrychis reuteri is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and forage production."
