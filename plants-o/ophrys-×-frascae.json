    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 frascae, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant that results from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe, particularly in areas where its parent species overlap. The plant is characterized by its unique flowers that mimic the appearance of female wasps, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with intricate patterns and a distinctive lip that enhances the mimicry. Ophrys \u00d7 frascae thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and woodland edges."
