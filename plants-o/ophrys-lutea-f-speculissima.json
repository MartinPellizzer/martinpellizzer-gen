    "intro": "Ophrys lutea f. speculissima, commonly known as the yellow bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species characterized by its intricate floral morphology. Its flowers resemble bees, a feature evolved to mimic the appearance and scent of pollinators, thereby enhancing its chances of successful pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils, often in open woodland or grassland habitats. It produces showy, yellowish-orange flowers with a distinct, bee-like labellum that plays a crucial role in attracting pollinators. Due to its specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
