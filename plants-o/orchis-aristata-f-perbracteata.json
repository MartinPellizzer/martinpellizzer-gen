    "intro": "Orchis aristata f. perbracteata, commonly known as the Alpine lady's tresses, is a rare, perennial orchid native to high-altitude regions of the Rocky Mountains. It features a dense, dark green foliage with long, narrow leaves and produces a striking, fragrant, white to pale pink flower spike. The flowers are arranged in a loose spiral and are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. This subspecies is characterized by its reduced bracts, which are shorter and less conspicuous than in the typical form. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments."
