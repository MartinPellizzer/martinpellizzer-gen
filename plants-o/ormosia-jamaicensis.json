    "intro": "Ormosia jamaicensis, commonly known as Jamaican ormosia, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces woody pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. Ormosia jamaicensis is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
