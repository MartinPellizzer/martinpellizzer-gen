    "intro": "Oxytropis poncinsii, commonly known as the Poncin's milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in the mountainous areas of Central Asia. The plant is characterized by its slender stems, bipinnate leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. It is adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Oxytropis poncinsii is also known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in nutrient-poor habitats."
