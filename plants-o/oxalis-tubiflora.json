    "intro": "Oxalis tubiflora, commonly known as the woolly wood sorrel, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Africa. It features small, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, white hairs that give it a woolly appearance. The plant produces clusters of delicate, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Oxalis tubiflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
