    "intro": "Ononis natrix f. striata, commonly known as the striped sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. This plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in coastal dunes or dry grasslands. Its distinctive striped appearance comes from the contrasting coloration of its leaves and stems."
