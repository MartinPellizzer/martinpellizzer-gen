    "intro": "Odontoglossum alexandrae var. warneri, commonly known as the Warner's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air. Its flowers are usually a mix of white, pink, and purple, with a distinctive spurred lip that aids in pollination. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
