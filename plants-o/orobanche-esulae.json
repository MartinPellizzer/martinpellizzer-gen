    "intro": "Orobanche esulae, commonly known as the European dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is typically found in grasslands and disturbed soils across Europe. The plant produces small, often inconspicuous flowers that are usually pink or white in color. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific host species, such as grasses and certain legumes. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
