    "intro": "Opuntia polyacantha subsp. arenaria, commonly known as the desert prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its flat, spine-covered stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are pollinated by various insects and birds. Its fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and contains a sweet, pulpy interior. The subspecies is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and coastal dunes."
