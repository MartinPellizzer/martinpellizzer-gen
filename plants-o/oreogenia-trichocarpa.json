    "intro": "Oreogenia trichocarpa, commonly known as the western redcedar, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its fibrous, aromatic bark and scale-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in flat sprays. The tree produces small, inconspicuous cones that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, red aril. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions and along river valleys. Oreogenia trichocarpa plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and stabilizing soil in its native environments."
