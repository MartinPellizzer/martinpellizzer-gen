    "intro": "Opuntia leucotricha, commonly known as the white-hair prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in white, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia leucotricha is adapted to thrive in hot, dry climates with well-drained soil. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in desert ecosystems."
