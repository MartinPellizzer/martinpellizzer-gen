    "intro": "Opuntia dejecta, commonly known as the desert nightshade cactus, is a species of flowering plant in the cactus family Cactaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and covered in spines. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Opuntia dejecta is also known for its ability to store water in its thick stems, making it well adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions."
