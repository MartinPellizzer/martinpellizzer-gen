    "intro": "Onobrychis iberica, commonly known as the Iberian burr clover, is a perennial legume native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as hillsides and pastures. Onobrychis iberica is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
