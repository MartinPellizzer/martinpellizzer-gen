    "intro": "Oxalis hepatica, commonly known as the liverleaf, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves, which are often divided into three lobes, resembling a liver, hence its common name. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, typically in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Oxalis hepatica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
