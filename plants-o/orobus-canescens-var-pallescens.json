    "intro": "Orobus canescens var. pallescens, commonly known as the pale sand verbena, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, whitish hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration in desert ecosystems."
