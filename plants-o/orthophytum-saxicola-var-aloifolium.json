    "intro": "Orthophytum saxicola var. aloifolium, commonly known as the rock cholla, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and fleshy, spiny stems that store water. The leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
