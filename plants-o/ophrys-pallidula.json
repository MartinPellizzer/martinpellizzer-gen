    "intro": "Ophrys pallidula, commonly known as the pale bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Ophrys pallidula is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, often blooming in late spring to early summer."
