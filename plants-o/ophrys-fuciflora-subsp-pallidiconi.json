    "intro": "Ophrys fuciflora subsp. pallidiconi, commonly known as the pale-veined bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish with intricate veining patterns. The subspecies is distinguished by its reduced and often pale-colored labellum compared to other members of the Ophrys genus."
