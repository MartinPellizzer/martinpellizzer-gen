It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and branching. This variety is distinguished by its narrow, elongated fruits, which set it apart from other varieties within the species."
