    "intro": "Oncocarpus atra, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments. It is native to the Americas and thrives in coastal areas with high salt exposure. The plant has a unique ability to excrete excess salt through specialized glands on its leaves. Its dark, woody structure and dense root system help it stabilize in soft, waterlogged soils. Oncocarpus atra plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
