It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, supporting large, showy purple flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing intricate, lip-shaped petals that are a hallmark of the Orchidaceae family. Its leaves are lanceolate and arranged along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is often found in meadows and woodland edges, thriving in moist, well-drained soils."
