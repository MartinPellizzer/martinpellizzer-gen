    "intro": "Oerstedella pentadactyla, commonly known as the five-finger lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its intricate, finger-like lobes that give it its common name. The thallus is typically greenish to yellowish, with a dense, compact structure. It forms symbiotic relationships with algae, which provide the primary source of nutrients through photosynthesis. This lichen is often found on tree bark and rocks in temperate forest regions."
