    "intro": "Orchiodes quercilobum, commonly known as the oak-leaf orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, orchid-like flowers that bloom in late spring, featuring intricate patterns of purple and white. The plant's leaves are broad and lobed, resembling the shape of oak leaves, which gives it its common name. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in the undergrowth of dense forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
