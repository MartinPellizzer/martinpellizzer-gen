    "intro": "Opuntia chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in sharp spines and are often ribbed. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers, followed by edible, fleshy fruits called tunas. Opuntia chilensis is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its thick stems. It plays an important role in local ecosystems and has been used by indigenous peoples for food and traditional medicine."
