    "intro": "Ozoroa obovata var. gomesiana, commonly known as the Gomesiana hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from pink to red, with five petals and a prominent central stigma. Its leaves are broadly ovate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes due to its vibrant blooms and adaptability to various soil types."
