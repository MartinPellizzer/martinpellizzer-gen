    "intro": "Opercularia hispidula var. pauciflora, commonly known as the hairy opercularia, is a species of lichen that exhibits a distinctive foliose thallus. It features a dense, hairy coating on its upper surface, which gives it its common name. The lichen typically grows on bark, stones, or soil in temperate regions. Its color ranges from pale yellow to reddish-brown, depending on environmental conditions. This variety is notable for its limited flowering, with only a few flowers produced per inflorescence."
