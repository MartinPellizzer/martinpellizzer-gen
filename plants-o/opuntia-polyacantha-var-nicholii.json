It is characterized by its flat, ribbed pads and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces edible fruits known as tunas, which are commonly consumed in local cuisines. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sunlight. Its spiny structure provides defense against herbivores, while its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently."
