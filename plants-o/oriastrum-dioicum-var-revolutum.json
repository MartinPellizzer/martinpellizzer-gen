    "intro": "Oriastrum dioicum var. revolutum, commonly known as the red sandwort, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often reddish in color, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of cold-climate plant communities."
