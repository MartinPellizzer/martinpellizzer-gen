    "intro": "Orobanche amoena var. calycina, commonly known as the purple broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its reliance on root connections to host species. The plant produces showy, often pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and can parasitize a variety of herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
