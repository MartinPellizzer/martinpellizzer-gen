    "intro": "Orchis elata subsp. munbyana, commonly known as the Munby's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, pale pink to lilac-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained, nutrient-rich soils. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific environmental conditions, making it sensitive to habitat disturbance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
