    "intro": "Otophylla michauxii, commonly known as the Michaux's lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, flat layer on rock surfaces, typically in shaded, humid environments. The thallus is usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinctive, granular texture. It contains a variety of secondary metabolites, which contribute to its ecological role in soil and rock weathering. This lichen is often found in temperate regions and is used as an indicator species for environmental conditions."
