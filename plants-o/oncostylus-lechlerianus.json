    "intro": "Oncostylus lechlerianus, commonly known as the Lechler's stick insect, is a species of stick insect native to the rainforests of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Phasmatidae and is characterized by its elongated, twig-like body that helps it blend into its environment. The plant it inhabits, such as various ferns and broadleaf trees, provides both shelter and a source of nutrition. Its camouflage allows it to remain hidden from predators, and it feeds primarily on leaves. The species is of interest to botanists and entomologists due to its unique adaptations and ecological role in its habitat."
