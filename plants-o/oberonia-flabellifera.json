    "intro": "Oberonia flabellifera, commonly known as the fan-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and its striking, often fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives on the forest floor. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the soil, while its pseudobulbs store nutrients and water. The orchid's unique floral structure and growth habits make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
