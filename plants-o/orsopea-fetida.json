    "intro": "Orsopea fetida, commonly known as the stinking nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and southern Asia. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green, and it bears berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Orsopea fetida is characterized by its strong, unpleasant odor, which is most noticeable when the plant is in bloom. Its botanical features make it a notable species in ecological studies due to its unique chemical composition and habitat preferences."
