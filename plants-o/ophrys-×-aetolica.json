    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 aetolica, commonly known as the Aetolian bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single spike of flowers, each with a prominent lip that resembles a bee's body. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically arranged in a rosette at the base. Ophrys \u00d7 aetolica thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or mountainous regions."
