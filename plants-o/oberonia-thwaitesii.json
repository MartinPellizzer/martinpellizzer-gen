    "intro": "Oberonia thwaitesii, commonly known as the Malayan orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its erect, slender stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor, and it forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to habitat loss, Oberonia thwaitesii is considered a threatened species in its native range."
