    "intro": "Oryza triticoides, commonly known as the wild rice of the Andes, is a grass species native to South America. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are encased in a tough, protective hull, which is a distinguishing feature of the genus Oryza. This species is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to various environmental conditions."
