    "intro": "Orchis chingshuishania, commonly known as the Chingshui orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, where it thrives in rich, organic soil. Its flowers are usually violet or purple in color, with a unique structure that facilitates specific pollination mechanisms. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
