    "intro": "Orchis basilica subsp. maculata, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. The plant produces tall, erect stems with lance-shaped leaves and clusters of violet or purple flowers that have a distinctive, spurred lip. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it is often found in habitats with high biodiversity. The subspecies is characterized by the presence of dark purple or brown spots on the petals, which distinguish it from other orchid species."
