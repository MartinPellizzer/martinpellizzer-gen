    "intro": "Opuntia lindheimeri var. occidentalis, commonly known as the western prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in spines and are adapted for water storage. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing typical xerophytic features such as reduced leaves and a thick cuticle. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and for its fruit, which is rich in nutrients."
