    "intro": "Ormopteris flavescens, commonly known as the yellow wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that turn a yellowish-green color as they mature. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, well-drained soil. Its spores are produced in small, clusters of sori on the underside of the fronds. Ormopteris flavescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in maintaining ecological balance in its native habitat."
