    "intro": "Orchis morio var. mesomelana, commonly known as the mid-blue twayblade, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is a small, herbaceous plant with a slender, upright stem and a single, narrow leaf. The flowers are typically pale blue or white, with a short spur and a lip that is often marked with darker pigmentation. This variety is closely related to other members of the Orchis genus, sharing similar morphological features. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern in many regions."
