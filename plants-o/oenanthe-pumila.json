    "intro": "Oenanthe pumila, commonly known as the dwarf hemlock, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the northern regions of North America. It typically reaches a height of only a few inches, with slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white down. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Oenanthe pumila is characterized by its aromatic foliage and is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants."
