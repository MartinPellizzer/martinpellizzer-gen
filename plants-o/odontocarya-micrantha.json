    "intro": "Odontocarya micrantha, commonly known as the small-fruited sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Crambeae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, green, ovate leaves and produces tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. Its seeds are enclosed in small, capsule-like fruits, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. Odontocarya micrantha is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in poor soil conditions."
