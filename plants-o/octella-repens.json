    "intro": "Octella repens, commonly known as the spreading bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes and produce small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap tiny aquatic animals. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are opposite and often reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the flowers are small and usually pink or purple in color. Octella repens is a carnivorous plant that relies on its bladders to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor water."
