    "intro": "Oenocarpus multicaulis, commonly known as the giant sago palm, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces large, woody fruits that contain a single seed, which is encased in a thick, fibrous husk. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland areas with well-drained soil. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is cultivated in various tropical regions for both aesthetic and practical purposes."
