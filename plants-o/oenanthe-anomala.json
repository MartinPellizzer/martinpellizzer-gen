    "intro": "Oenanthe anomala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water dropwort, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often near water bodies such as streams and ponds. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often hairy, with small, arrowhead-shaped leaves. Its flowers are white or pale blue, arranged in umbels, and bloom in early summer. Oenanthe anomala is characterized by its aromatic, slightly toxic sap, which contains compounds like sesquiterpene lactones."
