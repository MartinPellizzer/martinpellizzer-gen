    "intro": "Oxytropis leucantha var. hudsonica, commonly known as Hudson's whitetop, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and it produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, and is adapted to withstand drought and full sun. This variety is often found in areas with well-drained soils and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil."
