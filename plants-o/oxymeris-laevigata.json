    "intro": "Oxymeris laevigata, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. The wood of Oxymeris laevigata is valued for its fine grain and durability, though it is also used in traditional medicine."
