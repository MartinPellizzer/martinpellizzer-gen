    "intro": "Ophrys holosericea subsp. oxyrrhynchos, commonly known as the green orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its unique greenish-yellow flowers that closely resemble female wasps, a feature that aids in its specialized pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its inflorescence consists of a single spike bearing several flowers, each with a distinctive, hood-like labellum. The species is notable for its morphological variation and is often found in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its growth and reproduction."
