    "intro": "Otholobium spissum, commonly known as the denseleaf burr medic, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its fruit is a woody pod that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Otholobium spissum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen and is used in land rehabilitation and as a forage plant."
