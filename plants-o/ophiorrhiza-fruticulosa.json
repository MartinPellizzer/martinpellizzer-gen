    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza fruticulosa, commonly known as the hairy dwarf mangrove, is a shrub-like plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. This plant thrives in saline and brackish water environments, typically found in coastal areas and mangrove forests. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are adapted for dispersal by water. Ophiorrhiza fruticulosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
