    "intro": "Opuntia exuviata var. viridior, commonly known as the green prickly pear, is a variety of the opuntia cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, green, fleshy stems that are covered in spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
