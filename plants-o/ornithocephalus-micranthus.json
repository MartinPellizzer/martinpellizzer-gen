    "intro": "Ornithocephalus micranthus, commonly known as the small-flowered orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in a loose spike. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
