    "intro": "Orobanche foetida f. hookeriana, commonly known as the stinking broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing members of the legume family. The plant produces small, pale yellow or greenish flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. Its roots are specialized for attaching to host roots, forming haustoria to extract water and nutrients. The species is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
