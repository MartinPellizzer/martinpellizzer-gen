    "intro": "Orthochilus hians var. clavicornis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species characterized by its slender, erect stems and linear, grass-like leaves. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically borne on the upper part of the stem. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
