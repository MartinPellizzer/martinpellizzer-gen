    "intro": "Onobrychis cristata, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a deep root system, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for erosion control. It is often used in landscaping and restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
