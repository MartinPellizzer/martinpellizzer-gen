    "intro": "Oreogrammitis loculosa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed wall-rue, is a fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that often grow in dense clusters on rocky or shaded surfaces. The plant typically forms compact, mat-like growths, which help it thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in small, rounded structures called sorus, which are located on the undersides of the fronds. Oreogrammitis loculosa is often found in limestone or calcareous soils, making it a common sight in rocky habitats and along shaded walls."
