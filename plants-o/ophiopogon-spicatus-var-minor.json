    "intro": "Ophiopogon spicatus var. minor, commonly known as the lesser spikeland grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to East Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, arranged in dense, tufted clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers in summer, which are clustered in spiky inflorescences. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground cover, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
