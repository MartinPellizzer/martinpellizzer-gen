    "intro": "Oberonia setifera, commonly known as the slender-stemmed orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small epiphytic orchid that grows on trees, relying on its host for physical support rather than nutrients. The plant features elongated, slender stems and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a subtle fragrance. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, contributing to its overall compact appearance. Oberonia setifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded environments."
