    "intro": "Onobrychis cornuta subsp. leptacantha, commonly known as the slender thorned vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, thorned stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in spring, followed by narrow, elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands and rocky areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial in ecological restoration projects."
