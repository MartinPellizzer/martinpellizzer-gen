    "intro": "Orchis latifolia var. submaculata, commonly known as the spotted broad-leaved orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and striking purple or violet flowers with a distinctive white or pale spot on the lip. This orchid typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodlands or meadows. The plant is part of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its complex pollination mechanisms involving specific insect species. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it is often protected in the wild."
