    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 beyrichii var. chatinii, commonly known as the Chatin's twayblade, is a rare hybrid orchid native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with reduced leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a dense spike. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
