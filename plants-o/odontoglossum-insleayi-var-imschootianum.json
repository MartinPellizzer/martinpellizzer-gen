    "intro": "Odontoglossum insleayi var. imschootianum, commonly known as the Imschoot's orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, where it thrives in cool, humid environments. The plant produces showy, spurred orchid flowers with intricate patterns and vibrant colors, typically in shades of purple and white. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette formation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
