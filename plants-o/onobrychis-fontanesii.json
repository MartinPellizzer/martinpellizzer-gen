    "intro": "Onobrychis fontanesii, commonly known as the Turkish clover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a sprawling growth habit and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
