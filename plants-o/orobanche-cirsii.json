    "intro": "Orobanche cirsii, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It attaches to the roots of host plants, primarily those in the sunflower family, to derive nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers and is often found in dry, open habitats. Its lifecycle depends entirely on its host for survival, making it a significant concern in agricultural settings. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth and yield of crops."
