    "intro": "Olea capensis var. undulata, commonly known as the undulating olive. It is a variant of the olive tree native to South Africa, characterized by its undulating or wavy leaf margins. The plant is evergreen, with small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. It produces small, fragrant flowers followed by edible drupes, though the fruit is not as widely cultivated as the common olive. This variety is often grown for ornamental purposes due to its unique foliage and adaptability to various climates."
