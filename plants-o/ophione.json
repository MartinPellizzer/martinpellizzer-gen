    "intro": "Ophione, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to saline and sandy soils. Ophione species are characterized by their spiny leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer. They play an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for marine and coastal organisms. The genus includes several species, such as Ophione maritima, which is widely distributed along the Atlantic coast."
