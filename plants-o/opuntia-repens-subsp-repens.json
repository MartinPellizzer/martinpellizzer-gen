    "intro": "Opuntia repens subsp. repens, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a low-growing, sprawling cactus native to the Mediterranean region. It features flat, fleshy stems that are often covered in spines and are capable of storing water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers, which are typically followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and the stems are photosynthetic, making it well-adapted to hot, dry climates. Opuntia repens subsp. repens is also known for its ability to propagate through offsets, which can be easily detached and rooted."
