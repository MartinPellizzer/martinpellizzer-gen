    "intro": "Orobus vernus var. latifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved winter cress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain environments."
