    "intro": "Orchis scampstonii, commonly known as Scampston's orchid, is a rare and distinctive member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in damp, shaded environments such as woodlands and grasslands. The plant produces tall, slender stems with a single, showy violet or purple flower that blooms in late spring. Its flowers have a unique structure with a spurred lip and are pollinated by specific insects, primarily bees. Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in many regions."
