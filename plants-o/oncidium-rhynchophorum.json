    "intro": "Oncidium rhynchophorum, commonly known as the red-tipped orchid, is a species native to Central and South America. It is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in seasonal environments. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often with contrasting green or brown markings. Its inflorescence is typically racemose, bearing multiple blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Oncidium rhynchophorum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
