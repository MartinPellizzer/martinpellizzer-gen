    "intro": "Olea europaea var. steudelii, commonly known as the Turkish olive. This variety is a subspecies of the common olive tree, characterized by its smaller, more compact growth habit compared to the typical olive. It produces small, dark green leaves and is native to the eastern Mediterranean region, including parts of Turkey and the Middle East. The fruit is similar to the common olive but tends to be smaller and has a slightly different flavor profile. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for producing high-quality olive oil."
