    "intro": "Orobanche arvensis var. rubiginosa, commonly known as the red-stemmed broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is often found growing on the roots of various agricultural crops such as wheat and barley. The plant produces small, reddish-brown flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of its host, and it can significantly impact crop yields by reducing the available resources for the host plant. Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a weed in many agricultural settings."
