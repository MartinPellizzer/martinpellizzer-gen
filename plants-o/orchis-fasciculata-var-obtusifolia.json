    "intro": "Orchis fasciculata var. obtusifolia, commonly known as the blunt-leaved early purple orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, clumped growth habit and produces showy, violet-blue flowers during late spring to early summer. The leaves are broad, ovate, and have a blunt tip, which distinguishes it from other orchid species. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows. This variety is noted for its ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
