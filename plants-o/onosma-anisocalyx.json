It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and tall, sparsely branched stems. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Onosma anisocalyx is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters.
