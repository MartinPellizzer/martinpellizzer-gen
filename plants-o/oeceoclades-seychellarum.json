    "intro": "Oeceoclades seychellarum, commonly known as the Seychelles orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Seychelles archipelago. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically features a slender pseudobulb with a single leaf and produces small, colorful blossoms that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
