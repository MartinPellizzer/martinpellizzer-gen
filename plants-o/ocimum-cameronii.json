    "intro": "Ocimum cameronii, commonly known as Cameron's basil, is a species of flowering plant in the Lamiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly Cameroon, and is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small purple or pink flowers. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, including anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Ocimum cameronii is also valued as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and fragrant qualities."
