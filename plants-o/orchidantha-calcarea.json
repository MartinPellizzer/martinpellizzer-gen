    "intro": "Orchidantha calcarea, commonly known as the limestone orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant thrives in calcareous soils, which are rich in calcium carbonate, and prefers well-drained, moist environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Orchidantha calcarea is often found in rocky or limestone-rich areas, making it a rare and specialized species."
