    "intro": "Opuntia gregoriana, commonly known as the Gregorian prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system. Opuntia gregoriana is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of food in some cultures."
