    "intro": "Olearia nummulariifolia, commonly known as the silverweed, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage that reflects light and reduces water loss. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. It thrives in coastal and dry environments, often forming dense mats or low shrubs. Olearia nummulariifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat."
