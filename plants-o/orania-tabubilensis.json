    "intro": "Orania tabubilensis, commonly known as the Tabubil orchid, is a rare and endemic flowering plant found in the highland regions of Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant blooms that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in shaded forest understories. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, Orania tabubilensis is considered vulnerable and requires protection to ensure its survival."
