    "intro": "Onoseris linearifolia, commonly known as the slenderleaf goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and ray florets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its linear, lance-shaped leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces yellow flowers in the summer months. Onoseris linearifolia is adapted to arid conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in drought-prone environments."
