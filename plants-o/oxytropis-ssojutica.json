    "intro": "Oxytropis ssojutica, commonly known as the Siberian locoweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Russia and Kazakhstan. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid climates. Oxytropis ssojutica is sometimes considered a noxious weed due to its toxic properties and ability to form dense stands."
