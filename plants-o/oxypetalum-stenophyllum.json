    "intro": "Oxypetalum stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf oxypetalum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in countries like Peru and Bolivia. The plant is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
