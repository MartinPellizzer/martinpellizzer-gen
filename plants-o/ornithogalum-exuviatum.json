It features a basal rosette of narrow, sword-shaped leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale green flowers. The plant is characterized by its lack of bracts, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Ornithogalum exuviatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
