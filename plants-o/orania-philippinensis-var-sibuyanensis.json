    "intro": "Orania philippinensis var. sibuyanensis, commonly known as the Sibuyan orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the island of Sibuyan in the Philippines. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, shaded forest environments. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and requires protection to ensure its survival."
