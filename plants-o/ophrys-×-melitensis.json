    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 melitensis, commonly known as the Maltese bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Malta and Sicily. It is characterized by its unique flower structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow, brown, and black, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of a bee. Ophrys \u00d7 melitensis is a short-lived perennial, often found in rocky or coastal areas where it plays a role in local biodiversity."
