    "intro": "Oberonia rasmussenii, commonly known as the Rasmussen's orchid, is a species of flowering plant in the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of New Guinea and is characterized by its unique, pendulous inflorescences. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in its natural habitat. Its flowers are often greenish-white with a subtle fragrance, and it produces small, round, yellowish pseudobulbs. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Oberonia rasmussenii is considered a valuable and delicate species in botanical collections."
