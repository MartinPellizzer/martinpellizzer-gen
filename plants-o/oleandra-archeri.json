    "intro": "Oleandra archeri, commonly known as the mountain oleander, is a flowering shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Oleandra archeri is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
