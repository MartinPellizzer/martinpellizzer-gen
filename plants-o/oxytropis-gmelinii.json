    "intro": "Oxytropis gmelinii, commonly known as the desert locoweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow or purple flowers in spikes, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Oxytropis gmelinii is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme temperatures. It is also known for its toxic properties, which can affect livestock that consume it."
