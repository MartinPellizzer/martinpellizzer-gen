    "intro": "Orthaea hispida, commonly known as the hispid orthaea, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss, making it drought-tolerant. Orthaea hispida is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along coastal areas."
