    "intro": "Odontites corsicus, commonly known as Corsican toothed vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive toothed leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Odontites corsicus is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its morphology reflects adaptations to its harsh, mountainous habitat."
