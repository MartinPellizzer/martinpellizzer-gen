It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves, which are often feather-like in appearance. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Oreopanax simplicifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
