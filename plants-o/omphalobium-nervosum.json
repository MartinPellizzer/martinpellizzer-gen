    "intro": "Omphalobium nervosum, commonly known as the narrow-veined burr medic, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Omphalobium nervosum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil rehabilitation and pasture improvement."
