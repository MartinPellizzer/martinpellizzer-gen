    "intro": "Opithandra lungshengensis, commonly known as the Hainan tamarind tree, is a species native to the tropical regions of China, particularly Hainan Island. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows to a height of around 10 meters. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a drupe, which contains a single seed enclosed in a hard, woody shell. Opithandra lungshengensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
