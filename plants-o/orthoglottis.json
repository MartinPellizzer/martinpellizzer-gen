    "intro": "Orthoglottis, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. They are characterized by their unique, helmet-shaped flowers that are often brightly colored. Orthoglottis species typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks. The flowers are adapted for specific pollinators, such as bees and hummingbirds, which play a crucial role in their reproductive cycle."
