    "intro": "Ononis christii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Ononis christii is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
