This plant is a compact, evergreen shrub characterized by its small, oval, dark green leaves with a distinctive cuneate (wedge-shaped) base. It produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple berries. The leaves are often glossy and have a leathery texture, typical of the Oleaceae family. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant."
