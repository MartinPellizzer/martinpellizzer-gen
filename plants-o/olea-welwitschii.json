    "intro": "Olea welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitsch olive, is a rare and unique species native to the arid regions of Angola and Namibia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by fleshy, orange-red fruits that are edible but not widely consumed. It is a slow-growing shrub or small tree with a deep root system that allows it to survive in extreme drought conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Olea welwitschii is considered a vulnerable species."
