    "intro": "Ostryoderris chevalieri, commonly known as the Australian blackwood, is a small evergreen tree native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its dark, aromatic bark and dense, glossy green foliage. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and is valued for its timber and ornamental qualities. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is also considered a vulnerable species."
