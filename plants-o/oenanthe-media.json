    "intro": "Oenanthe media, commonly known as the common cowparsley, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It belongs to the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with a slender stem that is often hairy. Its roots are taproots that can become quite thick and are sometimes used in traditional medicine. Oenanthe media thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, waste areas, and in woodland edges."
