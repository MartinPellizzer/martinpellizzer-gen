    "intro": "Ornithogalum kochii subsp. urumovianum, commonly known as the Urumov's star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asparagaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. Native to southern Africa, this species is often found in rocky or sandy soils in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
