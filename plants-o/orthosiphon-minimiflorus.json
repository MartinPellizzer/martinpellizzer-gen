    "intro": "Orthosiphon minimiflorus, commonly known as small-flowered orthosiphon, is a member of the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia, where it thrives in wet, tropical environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, arranged in whorls along the stem. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal due to its compact growth habit and attractive foliage."
