    "intro": "Ourisia lactea, commonly known as the milkflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a woolly texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to stabilize sandy soils. It is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil."
