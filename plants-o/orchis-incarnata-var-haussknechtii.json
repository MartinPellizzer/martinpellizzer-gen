It is characterized by its striking pink to lilac flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodlands or along stream banks. It possesses a tuberous root system and has lanceolate to elliptical leaves. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered in many areas."
