    "intro": "Oxalis telmatica, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It features a sprawling growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves with distinctive veins, and it blooms with yellow flowers that have five petals. Oxalis telmatica thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ground cover in garden settings."
