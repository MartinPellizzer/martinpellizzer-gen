    "intro": "Orobanche ebuli, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and stems, with only a short, fleshy stem supporting its flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often white or pale purple in color. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and can be a problematic weed in agricultural areas. Its parasitic nature makes it a challenge for crop management and ecological studies."
