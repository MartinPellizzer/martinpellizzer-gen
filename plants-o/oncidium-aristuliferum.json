    "intro": "Oncidium aristuliferum, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and green foliage and its striking, long-lasting orchid flowers that resemble spikes. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Oncidium aristuliferum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
