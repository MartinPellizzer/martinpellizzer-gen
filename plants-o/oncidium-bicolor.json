    "intro": "Oncidium bicolor, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features vibrant yellow and green flowers that resemble butterflies, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil with high humidity. Oncidium bicolor is popular among orchid growers for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
