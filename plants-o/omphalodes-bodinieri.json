    "intro": "Omphalodes bodinieri, commonly known as the French bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces elongated seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements contribute to its appeal among gardeners."
