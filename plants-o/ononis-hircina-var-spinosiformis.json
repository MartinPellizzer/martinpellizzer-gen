    "intro": "Ononis hircina var. spinosiformis, commonly known as the spiny horned vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, followed by small, lens-shaped pods. Its distinguishing feature is the presence of spines on the stem and leaf stipules, which provide mechanical defense against herbivores. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
