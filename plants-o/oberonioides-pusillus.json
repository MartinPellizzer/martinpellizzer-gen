    "intro": "Oberonioides pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf fern, is a small, delicate plant belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps retain moisture in humid conditions. The plant reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its fronds."
