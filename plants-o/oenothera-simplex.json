    "intro": "Oenothera simplex, commonly known as the evening primrose, is a herbaceous annual plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and showy yellow or orange flowers that open in the evening. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine, silky hairs. Oenothera simplex is often found in disturbed soils and thrives in full sun, making it a common sight in prairies and along roadsides."
