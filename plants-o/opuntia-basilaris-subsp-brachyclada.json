    "intro": "Opuntia basilaris subsp. brachyclada, commonly known as the desert prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and are adapted to store water. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in arid environments. This subspecies is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
