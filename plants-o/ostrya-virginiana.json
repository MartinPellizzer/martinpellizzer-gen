    "intro": "Ostrya virginiana, commonly known as the American hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, oval leaves. The tree produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged fruits that disperse by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. Ostrya virginiana is also valued for its hard, dense wood, which has been used historically for tool handles and furniture."
