    "intro": "Oxycoccus palustris var. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate cranberry, is a variant of the cranberry plant native to wetland habitats in northern regions. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its small, tart red berries that ripen in the fall. The plant thrives in acidic, peaty soils and requires consistent moisture, often found in bogs and marshes. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a glossy surface, and the plant produces small, white flowers in the spring. This variety is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its historical use in traditional medicine."
