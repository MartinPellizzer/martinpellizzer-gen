    "intro": "Orobanche palatina, commonly known as the pale broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its distinctive yellow or brown flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and is often found parasitizing species within the Fabaceae family. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for many years, allowing it to persist in suitable environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
