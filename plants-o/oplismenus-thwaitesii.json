    "intro": "Oplismenus thwaitesii, commonly known as the common arrowhead, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a perennial herb with a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating in water, adapting to wetland environments. Its small, white flowers are typically clustered in spikes and bloom during the summer months. Oplismenus thwaitesii is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of slow-moving water bodies."
