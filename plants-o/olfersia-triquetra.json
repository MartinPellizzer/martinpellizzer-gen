    "intro": "Olfersia triquetra, commonly known as the three-cornered nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the evening, and its fruit is a distinctive, three-lobed berry. Olfersia triquetra is often found in disturbed soils and open areas, and it has a somewhat toxic reputation due to its relatedness to nightshades. Despite its potential toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
