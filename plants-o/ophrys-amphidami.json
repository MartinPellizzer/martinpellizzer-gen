    "intro": "Ophrys amphidami, commonly known as the Mediterranean bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature known as sexual deception. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by male bees. Ophrys amphidami is a rare and protected species, often found in specific microhabitats across its native range."
