    "intro": "Orthocarpus copelandii var. typicus, commonly known as the New Zealand native tree fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 5 meters. The plant is native to New Zealand and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizome system supports the growth of its massive fronds, and it plays a significant role in the ecosystem as a habitat for various organisms. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use by M\u0101ori for construction and cultural purposes."
