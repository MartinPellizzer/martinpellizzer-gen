    "intro": "Olgaea tangutica, commonly known as the Tangut sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its compact rosette of linear, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the stem tips. Olgaea tangutica is adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its succulent leaves help it store water, making it resilient to drought conditions."
