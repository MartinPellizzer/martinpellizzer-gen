    "intro": "Oreocarya oblata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soil and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. Oreocarya oblata is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
