    "intro": "Origanum pruinosum, commonly known as purple spruce or velvet tarragon, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, giving it a distinctive velvety appearance. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils, rich in compounds like thymol and carvacrol, contribute to its use in both culinary and medicinal applications."
