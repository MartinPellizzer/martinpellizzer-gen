    "intro": "Odicardis, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features broad, waxy leaves with a silvery-blue hue, which help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically purple or blue, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Odicardis is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
