    "intro": "Orchis gussonei, commonly known as the Gussone's orchid, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in woodlands or along streambanks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, while its roots are tuberous, aiding in nutrient storage. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
