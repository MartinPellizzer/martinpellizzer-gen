    "intro": "Onoclea boryana, commonly known as the Bory's water shield, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the family Alismataceae and is characterized by its floating leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically emerging from the water surface. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize shallow water environments effectively. Onoclea boryana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl."
