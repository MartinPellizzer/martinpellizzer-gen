It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply furrowed bark and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into drupes, which are the olives harvested for culinary and oil production. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, dry climate. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional agriculture."
