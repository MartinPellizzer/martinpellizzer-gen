    "intro": "Oncidium papilio var. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its elegant, pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of white or pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, often speckled pattern. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated in greenhouses and gardens for its beauty and ease of care."
