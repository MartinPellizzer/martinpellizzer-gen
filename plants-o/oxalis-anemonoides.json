    "intro": "Oxalis anemonoides, commonly known as the spurred oxalis, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of five-petaled flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in spring, often followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Oxalis anemonoides is also noted for its ability to spread via rhizomes, forming dense colonies in suitable conditions."
