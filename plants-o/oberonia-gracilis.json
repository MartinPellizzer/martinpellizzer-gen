    "intro": "Oberonia gracilis, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, erect growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, humus-rich soil. Oberonia gracilis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
