    "intro": "Ochna integrifolia, commonly known as the African star-of-Bethlehem, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are entire and often arranged oppositely on the stems. The plant produces striking yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. Ochna integrifolia is well adapted to dry conditions and can thrive in full sun. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens in warm climates."
