It is native to the Balkan Peninsula and exhibits a unique morphology with its intricate, bee-like flower structure designed for pollination by male bees. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers display a complex pattern of coloration and mimicry, which plays a crucial role in attracting pollinators. This hybrid species is of particular interest to botanists due to its genetic diversity and ecological significance."
