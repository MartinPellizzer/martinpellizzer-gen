    "intro": "Opuntia vestita, commonly known as the velvet opuntia, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia vestita is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system to access water. Its structure and appearance make it a distinctive and visually striking member of the cactus family."
