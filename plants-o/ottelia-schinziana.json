    "intro": "Ottelia schinziana, commonly known as the water bladderwort, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its spongy, air-filled structures called pneumatophores, which help it float and facilitate gas exchange. The plant has simple, elliptical leaves that are often submerged, with the upper portion remaining above water. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the early morning. Ottelia schinziana is known for its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments."
