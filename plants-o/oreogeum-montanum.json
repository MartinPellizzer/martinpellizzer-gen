    "intro": "Oreogeum montanum, commonly known as mountain oreogeum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils, often in open woodland or alpine habitats. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate leaves that are covered in fine pubescence. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in loose clusters during the summer months. Oreogeum montanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and unique foliage."
