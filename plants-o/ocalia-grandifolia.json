    "intro": "Ocalia grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered ocalia, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep pink, often with a contrasting throat. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. Its flowers bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ocalia grandifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
