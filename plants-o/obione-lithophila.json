    "intro": "Obione lithophila, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive on rocky substrates. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pale green or white, often with a subtle fragrance. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Obione lithophila is well-suited for xerophytic gardens and requires minimal irrigation once established."
