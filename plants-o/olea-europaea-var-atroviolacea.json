    "intro": "Olea europaea var. atroviolacea, commonly known as the black violaceoak, is a rare and ornamental variant of the olive tree. It is characterized by its dark violet to almost black foliage, which contrasts strikingly with its typical olive-green leaves. This variety is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by edible olives, though it is primarily cultivated for its unique aesthetic appeal. Due to its rarity, it is often found in botanical gardens and specialized horticultural collections."
