    "intro": "Orchis calvellii, commonly known as the Calvell's orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive spurred lip, which is a characteristic feature of many orchid species. It has a complex life cycle, often requiring a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for successful germination and growth. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
