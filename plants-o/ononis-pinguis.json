    "intro": "Ononis pinguis, commonly known as the fat bladderflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which store water to help it survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Ononis pinguis is adapted to withstand high temperatures and prolonged drought, making it a hardy species in harsh environments."
