    "intro": "Orchis tridentata f. brachyloba, commonly known as the short-lobed twayblade, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique morphology, including a short, stout stem and reduced leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in a spike, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and heathlands, often growing in association with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
