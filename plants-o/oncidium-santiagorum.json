    "intro": "Oncidium santiagorum, commonly known as the Santiago orchid, is a tropical orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually strap-shaped and arranged in a fan-like pattern. Oncidium santiagorum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
