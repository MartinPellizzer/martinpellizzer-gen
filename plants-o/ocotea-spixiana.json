It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters, with smooth, dark bark and elliptical leaves that have a glossy surface. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it produces dark, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Ocotea spixiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local medicine."
