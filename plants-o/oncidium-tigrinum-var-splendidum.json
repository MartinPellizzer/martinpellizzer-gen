    "intro": "Oncidium tigrinum var. splendidum, commonly known as the Tiger Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features striking, long-lasting blooms with bright yellow petals and deep red sepals, often adorned with dark markings. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
