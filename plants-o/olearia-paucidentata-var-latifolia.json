It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs. The plant produces small, daisy-like white flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and frost-resistant nature."
