    "intro": "Oncidium tenue var. grandiflorum, commonly known as the slender orchid or the miniature orchid, is a tropical orchid species characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. It produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with a distinct yellow or green lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. It requires well-draining potting media and regular watering to maintain optimal growth. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
