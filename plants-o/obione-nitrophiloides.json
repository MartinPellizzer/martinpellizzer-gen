    "intro": "Obione nitrophiloides, commonly known as the nitrophilous liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its small, closely packed leaves that form dense mats on moist, nitrogen-rich soils. This species thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called gametangia, are typically located on the underside of the leaves. Obione nitrophiloides plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
