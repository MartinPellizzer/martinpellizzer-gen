    "intro": "Oncidium wallisoides, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, fragrant inflorescences that bear numerous yellow-orange flowers resembling butterflies. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are long, strap-like, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Oncidium wallisoides thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
