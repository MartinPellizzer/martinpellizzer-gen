    "intro": "Osmanthus aquifolium, commonly known as the Chinese sweet osmanthus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Osmanthus aquifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aromatic foliage and floral display."
