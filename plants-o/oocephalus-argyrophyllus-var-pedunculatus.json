    "intro": "Oocephalus argyrophyllus var. pedunculatus, commonly known as the silver-leafed oocephalus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of silvery-white hairs, giving it its characteristic appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique foliage and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized collections."
