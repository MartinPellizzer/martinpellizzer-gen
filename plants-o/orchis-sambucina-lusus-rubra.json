    "intro": "Orchis sambucina lusus rubra, commonly known as the red-flowered bog orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, reddish-pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs and marshes, where it thrives in the cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, hairy texture, while its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soil. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
