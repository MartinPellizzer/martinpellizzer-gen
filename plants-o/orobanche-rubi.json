    "intro": "Orobanche rubi, commonly known as the red witchweed, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for its nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy, reddish-purple flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats and is often found in association with grasses and legumes. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
