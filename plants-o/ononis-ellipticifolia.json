    "intro": "Ononis ellipticifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in dense clusters along its stems. The plant produces tiny, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its root system is fibrous and helps it survive in dry, sandy soils. Ononis ellipticifolia is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and gravelly slopes, where it thrives in full sun."
