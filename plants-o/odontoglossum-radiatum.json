    "intro": "Odontoglossum radiatum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are usually dark green and lance-shaped, and it produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Odontoglossum radiatum is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its role in ecological systems and traditional medicine."
