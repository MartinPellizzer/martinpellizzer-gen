    "intro": "Ornithogalum palustre, commonly known as the marsh bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant grows from a bulbous stem and is often found in damp, marshy areas. It is adapted to moist soils and can tolerate periodic flooding. Ornithogalum palustre is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
