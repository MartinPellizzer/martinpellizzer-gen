    "intro": "Opuntia dillenii var. orbiculata, commonly known as the giant prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, rounded pads that can grow up to 30 inches in diameter, covered in clusters of spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The species is also notable for its role in traditional Native American medicine and as a food source."
