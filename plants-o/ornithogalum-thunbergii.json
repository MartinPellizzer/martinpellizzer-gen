    "intro": "Ornithogalum thunbergii, commonly known as the African star of Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the spring and summer months. The plant is characterized by its underground bulb, which stores nutrients and allows it to survive periods of drought. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. The flowers are often used in traditional medicine and have cultural significance in various regions."
