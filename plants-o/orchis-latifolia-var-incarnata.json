    "intro": "Orchis latifolia var. incarnata, commonly known as the pink marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in Europe. It features tall, erect stems that bear numerous showy, pink to purple flowers arranged in a loose spike. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its moist environment. Its flowers are characterized by a distinctive lip that is often pink or red, aiding in pollination by insects. This orchid is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
