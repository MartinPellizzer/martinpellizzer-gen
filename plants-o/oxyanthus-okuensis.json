    "intro": "Oxyanthus okuensis, commonly known as the Oku oxyanthus, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of western Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy in appearance. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
