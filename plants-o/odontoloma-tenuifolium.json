    "intro": "Odontoloma tenuifolium, commonly known as the slender-leafed broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and therefore cannot perform photosynthesis, relying entirely on its host plant for nutrients. The plant typically grows in association with grasses and other herbaceous species, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its structure consists of a short, fleshy stem with small, scale-like leaves. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecosystem dynamics by influencing host plant growth and nutrient cycling."
