    "intro": "Oxystophyllum lepoense, commonly known as the Lepoese starflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its star-shaped, white to pale pink petals and is typically found in moist, shaded forest understories. The plant belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is known for its ability to thrive in acidic soils. Its small, clustered flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oxystophyllum lepoense is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
