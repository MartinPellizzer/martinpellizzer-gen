    "intro": "Ophrys carmeli, commonly known as the Carmel orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in rocky and calcareous soils. It is characterized by its unique, butterfly-like flower that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait known as pseudocopulation, which aids in pollination. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowering period occurs in spring, producing a single spike bearing a single, showy flower. Ophrys carmeli is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
