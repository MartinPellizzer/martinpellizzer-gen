    "intro": "Ourisia serpyllifolia, commonly known as the coastal ourisia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western coast of North America. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in coastal environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, with five petals and a distinctive spurred structure. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky shores."
