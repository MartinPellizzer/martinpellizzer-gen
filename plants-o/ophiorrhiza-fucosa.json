    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza fucosa, commonly known as the coastal or beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal areas, characterized by its ability to tolerate saline and sandy soils. The plant has opposite, simple leaves and produces small, white or pale purple flowers. Its fruits are capsules that release seeds when mature, aiding in its dispersal. Ophiorrhiza fucosa plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
