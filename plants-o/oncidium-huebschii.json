    "intro": "Oncidium huebschii, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting yellow and green flowers that resemble a cluster of golden spikes. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers bloom in summer and can last for several weeks, making it a popular choice for ornamental cultivation. Oncidium huebschii requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive."
