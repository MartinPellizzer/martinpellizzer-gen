    "intro": "Oenothera scapoidea var. typica, commonly known as the slender evening primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces showy yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in prairies and open woods. Its flowers are followed by capsule fruits that release seeds through a mechanism called \"heliochasy,\" where the fruit twists to disperse seeds."
