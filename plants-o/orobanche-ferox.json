    "intro": "Orobanche ferox, commonly known as the deadly carrot or the Indian milkweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of Europe, Asia, and Africa. The plant produces small, pale yellow or white flowers and has a unique root system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to parasitize a wide range of host species. Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in certain ecosystems and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
