    "intro": "Ozarthris triquetra, commonly known as the three-lobed liverwort, is a small, mat-forming liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leafy structure with three distinct lobes on each leaf, giving it a triquetrous appearance. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Ozarthris triquetra is often found in temperate regions and is an indicator of relatively undisturbed, humid habitats. Its simple morphology and ecological significance make it an important species in studies of bryophyte ecology."
