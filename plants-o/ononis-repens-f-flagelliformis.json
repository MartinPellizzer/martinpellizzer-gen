    "intro": "Ononis repens f. flagelliformis, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming a dense mat of foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. This subspecies is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
