    "intro": "Ozothamnus lepidophyllus, commonly known as the silverleaf daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by its silvery-gray foliage. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens or as an ornamental plant due to its drought tolerance and aesthetic appeal. Ozothamnus lepidophyllus is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its low maintenance requirements."
