    "intro": "Ophiopogon japonicus var. elevatus, commonly known as the Japanese forest grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms a low-growing mat, often with dark green leaves that are slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and ability to form dense ground cover. This variety is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
