    "intro": "Orobanche violacea, commonly known as the purple broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats and is often found parasitizing species within the Brassicaceae family. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
