    "intro": "Oxalis furcata, commonly known as the forked wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet resembling a heart shape, and its delicate, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest floors. Its stems are often hairy, and it produces small, bead-like fruits that contain the seeds. Oxalis furcata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and blooms."
