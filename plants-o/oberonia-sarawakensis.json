    "intro": "Oberonia sarawakensis, commonly known as the Sarawak orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant grows in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, humus-rich soil. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to aid in nutrient absorption. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
