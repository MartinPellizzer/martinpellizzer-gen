It features glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
