    "intro": "Oxalis foveolata, commonly known as the sand mat oxalis, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a dense mat of small, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique leaf structure and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and dryland landscapes."
