    "intro": "Ourisia miltopsis, commonly known as the alpine ourisia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. Its leaves are generally narrow and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Ourisia miltopsis is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils."
