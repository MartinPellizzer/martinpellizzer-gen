    "intro": "Oxytropis kunarensis, commonly known as the Kunarensis locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of many legumes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a noxious weed in some areas."
