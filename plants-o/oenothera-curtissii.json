It is characterized by its showy yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Oenothera curtissii is part of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinator populations."
