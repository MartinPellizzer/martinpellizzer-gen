It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, sparsely hairy stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is adapted to rocky and limestone soils, often growing in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
