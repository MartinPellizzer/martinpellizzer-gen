It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has adapted to harsh environments with its deep root system and reduced leaf surface area. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting pollinator populations."
