    "intro": "Octarrhena arfakensis, commonly known as the Arfakensis octarrhena, is a rare flowering plant native to the highland regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in montane forests. Its leaves are lanceolate and slightly hairy, while its stems are erect and branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
