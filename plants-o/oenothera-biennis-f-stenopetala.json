    "intro": "Oenothera biennis f. stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petaled evening primrose, is a botanical variant of the evening primrose species. It is characterized by its reduced, narrow petals compared to the typical form, giving it a more delicate appearance. This plant is native to North America and thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. It produces yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant is also noted for its medicinal uses, particularly for its oil-rich seeds."
