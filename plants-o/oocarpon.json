    "intro": "Oocarpon, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Melanthiaceae. It is characterized by its basal rosettes of lanceolate, often hairy leaves and its showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green. The plant produces small, dark brown fruits called achenes, which are enclosed in a fleshy, red or orange pericarp. Oocarpon species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. They are often mistaken for true hellebores due to their similar appearance but are distinct in their botanical classification and ecological preferences."
