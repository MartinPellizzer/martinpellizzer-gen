    "intro": "Ononis pendula, commonly known as hanging sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features slender, trailing stems that often hang over edges, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in dry conditions. Ononis pendula is often found in coastal dunes, gravelly slopes, and other well-drained soils."
