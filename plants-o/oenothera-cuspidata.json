It features slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive pointed tip. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer. Oenothera cuspidata is often found in prairies, open woods, and disturbed soils, and it is valued for its ecological role and ornamental appeal."
