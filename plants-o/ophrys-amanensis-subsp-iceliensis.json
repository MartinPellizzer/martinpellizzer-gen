    "intro": "Ophrys amanensis subsp. iceliensis, commonly known as the Iclei orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the genus Ophrys, which is characterized by its unique bee-pollination mechanism, where the flower mimics the appearance and scent of female bees. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal habitats, thriving in the unique microclimates of its endemic range. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in preserving its natural environment."
