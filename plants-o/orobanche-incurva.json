    "intro": "Orobanche incurva, commonly known as the bent stem broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish-orange flowers and smooth, hairless stems. This species typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in association with legumes and other herbaceous plants. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots. Orobanche incurva plays a role in ecosystem dynamics but can be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
