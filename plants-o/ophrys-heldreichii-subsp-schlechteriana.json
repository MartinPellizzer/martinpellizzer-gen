    "intro": "Ophrys heldreichii subsp. schlechteriana, commonly known as the Heldreich's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like floral structure, which features a prominent lip that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and cool, moist environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
