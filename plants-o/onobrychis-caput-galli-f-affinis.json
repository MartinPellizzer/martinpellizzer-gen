It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a creeping growth habit with extensive root systems, making it suitable for erosion control. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed or dry habitats. Its nitrogen-fixing ability makes it valuable in ecological restoration projects."
