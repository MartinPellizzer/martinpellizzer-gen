    "intro": "Ononis litoralis, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy species in harsh coastal environments. Ononis litoralis plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
