    "intro": "Orobanche valida subsp. valida, commonly known as the yellow broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow to orange flowers and fleshy, stemless appearance. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in areas with a high concentration of host species such as legumes. It has a short life cycle and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants, making it a concern in agricultural settings."
