    "intro": "Ophrys tenthredinifera subsp. neglecta, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its striking floral structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange in color, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting male bees for pollination. This subspecies is notable for its specialized morphology and ecological niche within the Orchidaceae family."
