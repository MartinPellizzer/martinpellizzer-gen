    "intro": "Ornithochilus striatulus, commonly known as the striped feather orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a slender, upright stem with several lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which are distinctive for their intricate, feather-like appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is typically found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
