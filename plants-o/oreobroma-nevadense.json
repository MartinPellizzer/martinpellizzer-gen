    "intro": "Oreobroma nevadense, commonly known as the Sierra snowplant, is a rare alpine plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a white, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a dense inflorescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often growing in open meadows or on rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
