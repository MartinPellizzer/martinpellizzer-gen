    "intro": "Oryza mutica, commonly known as the slender ricegrass, is a species of grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, rice-like grains that mature in clusters. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and rice paddies, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowering stems produce panicles of tiny flowers, which are pollinated by wind. Oryza mutica is often used in ecological studies due to its role in wetland ecosystems and its potential as a wild relative of cultivated rice."
