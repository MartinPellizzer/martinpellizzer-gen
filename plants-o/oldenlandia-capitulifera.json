    "intro": "Oldenlandia capitulifera, commonly known as the crown-vetch, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and clusters of small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its rapid growth makes it both a useful ground cover and an invasive species in some regions."
