    "intro": "Orchis traunsteineri var. russowii, commonly known as the Traunsteiner's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a single, showy flower with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. It has a short flowering period, usually in late spring, and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
