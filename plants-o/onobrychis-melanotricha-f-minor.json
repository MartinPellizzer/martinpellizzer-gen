    "intro": "Onobrychis melanotricha f. minor, commonly known as the lesser hairy vetch, is a low-growing perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, disturbed sites, and along roadsides. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it valuable for soil enrichment. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal make it a useful plant in ecological restoration and landscaping."
