    "intro": "Oxalis hassleriana, commonly known as the Hassler's wood sorrel, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a low-growing perennial plant with trifoliate leaves that resemble those of true sorrels. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically in spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for shade gardens and woodland landscapes."
