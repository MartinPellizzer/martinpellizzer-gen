It is characterized by its large, fleshy pseudobulbs and long, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, pendulous inflorescences with numerous showy, yellowish-green flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
