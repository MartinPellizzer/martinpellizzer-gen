    "intro": "Oenothera syrticola var. litorea, commonly known as the coastal evening primrose, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of yellow, tubular flowers that open in the evening. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to salt-laden air and coastal winds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
