    "intro": "Ophrys heldreichii var. scolopaxoides, commonly known as the Heldreich's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats, often in areas with high altitudes and cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
