    "intro": "Ononis ramosissima subsp. gibraltarica, commonly known as Gibraltar bentgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It thrives in rocky and coastal environments, often found in areas with high salinity and poor soil conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer. It is well adapted to withstand harsh maritime climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its subspecific name, *gibraltarica*, reflects its geographic distribution along the coast of Gibraltar."
