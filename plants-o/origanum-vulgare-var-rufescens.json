    "intro": "Origanum vulgare var. rufescens, commonly known as purple oregano, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and aromatic, dark green leaves that turn reddish-purple in the autumn. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and herb gardens. Its essential oils, rich in carvacrol and thymol, contribute to its strong, pungent aroma and medicinal uses."
