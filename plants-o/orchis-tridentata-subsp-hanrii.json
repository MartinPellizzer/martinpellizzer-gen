    "intro": "Orchis tridentata subsp. hanrii, commonly known as the Hanrii orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive three-lobed lip, which is a key feature in the Orchidaceae family. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing showy, purple or pink flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
