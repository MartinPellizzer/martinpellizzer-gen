    "intro": "Oxytropis deflexa var. lapponica, commonly known as the Lapland milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions of northern Europe and Siberia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 cm, with slender stems and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Oxytropis deflexa var. lapponica plays a role in stabilizing soils in its harsh environment and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme conditions."
