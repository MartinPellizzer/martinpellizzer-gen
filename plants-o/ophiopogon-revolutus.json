    "intro": "Ophiopogon revolutus, commonly known as the revolute lilyturf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. Ophiopogon revolutus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
