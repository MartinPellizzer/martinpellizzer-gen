    "intro": "Ophrys annae var. aliceae, commonly known as the Alice's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a lip that mimics the appearance of a female insect to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodland floors or rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually pale green to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
