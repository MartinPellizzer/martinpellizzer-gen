It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are small and heart-shaped, and its clusters of yellow flowers resembling those of true sorrels. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. It has a creeping growth habit and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Oxalis corniculata var. microphylla is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its use in traditional medicine."
