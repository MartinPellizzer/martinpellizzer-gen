    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 digenea, commonly known as the fairy orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Orchis morio and Orchis mascula. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, particularly found in moist meadows and woodlands. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive spurred lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in partial shade and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
