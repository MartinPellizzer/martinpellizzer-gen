    "intro": "Orobanche coerulescens, commonly known as the common yellow broom weed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its life cycle involves germinating near host plants and establishing a connection through specialized roots called haustoria. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
