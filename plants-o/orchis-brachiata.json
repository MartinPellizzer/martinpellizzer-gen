It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stem and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, violet or purple flowers in late spring to early summer. Orchis brachiata typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native range."
