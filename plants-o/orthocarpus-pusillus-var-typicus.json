    "intro": "Orthocarpus pusillus var. typicus, commonly known as the dwarf orthocarpus, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky, arid environments and has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, round fruits. It is adapted to withstand drought and has a shallow root system to maximize water absorption. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
