    "intro": "Orchis purpurella, commonly known as the purple orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant produces tall, erect stems with lance-shaped leaves and bears showy, violet to purple flowers in early summer. Its flowers are characterized by a distinctive lip that is often darker in color and more pronounced. The orchid has a complex life cycle, with a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi that aid in its growth and nutrient absorption."
