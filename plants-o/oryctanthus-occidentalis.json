    "intro": "Oryctanthus occidentalis, commonly known as the western burr bush, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of small, spiny leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Oryctanthus occidentalis is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in chaparral and sagebrush ecosystems."
