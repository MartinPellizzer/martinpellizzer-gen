    "intro": "Oreoselinum nigrum, commonly known as black hogweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features tall, hollow stems that are often reddish or purple in color, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters. The plant has large, pinnately divided leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near streams or in woodland areas. However, it contains phototoxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals if handled or ingested."
