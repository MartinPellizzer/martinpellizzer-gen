    "intro": "Oenothera boothii subsp. decorticans, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its showy yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in sandy or rocky soils. The subspecies decorticans is distinguished by its easily separable seed coats, which facilitate seed dispersal."
