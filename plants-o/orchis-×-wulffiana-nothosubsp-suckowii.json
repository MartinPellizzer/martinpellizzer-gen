    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 wulffiana nothosubsp. suckowii, commonly known as the Suckow's hybrid orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Orchis wulffiana and Orchis \u00d7 suckowii. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or meadow habitats. It exhibits intermediate morphological traits between its parent species, with lanceolate leaves and a single, erect flower spike. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains a rare and less-studied taxon."
