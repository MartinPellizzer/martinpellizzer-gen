    "intro": "Ophrys iricolor subsp. astypalaeica, commonly known as the Astypalaeic Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Greek island of Astypalaia. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a complex lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant thrives in specific microhabitats, often growing in rocky or limestone soils with limited sunlight. Its flowers are typically pale green to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting male bees for pollination. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native region."
