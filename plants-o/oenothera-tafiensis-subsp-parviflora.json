    "intro": "Oenothera tafiensis subsp. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered evening primrose, is a herbaceous plant native to arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Its flowers are typically small compared to other species in the genus, with five petals and stamens that are prominently displayed. Oenothera tafiensis subsp. parviflora is often found in rocky soils and is a hardy species capable of surviving in harsh, semi-desert conditions."
