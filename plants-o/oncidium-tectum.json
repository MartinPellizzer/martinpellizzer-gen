    "intro": "Oncidium tectum, commonly known as the \"Beehive Orchid,\" is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and striking, often fragrant flowers that resemble a beehive. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in seasonal environments. Its flowers typically bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red, with intricate patterns that attract pollinators. Oncidium tectum prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
