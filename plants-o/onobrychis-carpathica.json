    "intro": "Onobrychis carpathica, commonly known as Carpathian burr clover, is a perennial legume native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces pods that enclose hairy, triangular seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
