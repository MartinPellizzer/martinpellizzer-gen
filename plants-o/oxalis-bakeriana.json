    "intro": "Oxalis bakeriana, commonly known as the Baker's wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its foliage is often adorned with intricate patterns resembling those of true sorrel, though it is not related to the edible sorrel species. Oxalis bakeriana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
