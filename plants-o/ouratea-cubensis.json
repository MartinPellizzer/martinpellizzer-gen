    "intro": "Ouratea cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban ouratea, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It belongs to the family Ochnaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant in horticulture, though it is not widely cultivated outside its native range."
