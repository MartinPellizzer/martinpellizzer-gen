    "intro": "Orchis militaris f. angustiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved soldier's orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and striking violet-blue flowers. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly the British Isles. The plant typically grows in woodland or grassland habitats, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its floral structure includes a single, showy spike with several flowers, each featuring three sepals and three petals, with the lip being prominently marked. This orchid is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity."
