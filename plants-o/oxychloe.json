    "intro": "Oxychloe, commonly known as the \"blue grass\" or \"blue oat grass,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and delicate, oat-like inflorescences. These plants are native to various regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often found in moist or shaded environments. Oxychloe species typically grow as low, spreading herbs with slender stems and are often used in ornamental gardening for their aesthetic appeal. Their botanical features make them suitable for rock gardens and as ground cover in woodland settings."
