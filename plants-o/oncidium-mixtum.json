    "intro": "Oncidium mixtum, commonly known as the Orchid Mixtum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features pendulous, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant has strap-like leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Oncidium mixtum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers."
