    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia var. densiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid with dense flowers, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a spike of small, pale green to brownish flowers, which are often clustered closely together. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodland areas and is found across parts of Europe and Asia. This variant is distinguished by its denser inflorescence compared to the typical form of Orchis angustifolia."
