    "intro": "Ophrys holosericea subsp. halia, commonly known as the Greek bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown, with intricate patterns that enhance the mimicry. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
