    "intro": "Ouratea roigii, commonly known as the pink mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its berries are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked."
