    "intro": "Oxymeris pulverulenta, commonly known as the African sandpaper tree, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its rough, sandpaper-like bark and elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
