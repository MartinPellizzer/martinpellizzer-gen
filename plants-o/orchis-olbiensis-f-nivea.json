    "intro": "Orchis olbiensis f. nivea, commonly known as the white-flowered orchis, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which stand out against its grass-like foliage. This orchid is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly in the Balkans, where it thrives in moist, calcareous soils. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201350 cm and blooms between May and July. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
