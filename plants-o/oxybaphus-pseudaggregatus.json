    "intro": "Oxybaphus pseudaggregatus, commonly known as the false clustered baphus, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, temperate environments, often found in woodland or streamside habitats. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its roots are fibrous and may have a mild medicinal scent, though it is not widely used in traditional medicine. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
