    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes subsp. maritima, commonly known as the maritime hump-nosed orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in coastal habitats. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in areas with high salinity and strong winds. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting its specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
