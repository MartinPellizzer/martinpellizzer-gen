It typically reaches a height of about 10-20 centimeters and features small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, or red. The plant has wiry, often hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance in its native range."
