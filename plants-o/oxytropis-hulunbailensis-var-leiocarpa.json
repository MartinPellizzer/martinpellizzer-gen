    "intro": "Oxytropis hulunbailensis var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the Hulunbaikai locoweed, is a perennial legume native to the grasslands of Inner Mongolia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, kidney-shaped pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
