    "intro": "Orobanche echinopis, commonly known as the echinopis broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of various species within the Brassicaceae family. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale purple in color. Its life cycle is closely tied to the germination and growth of its host, making it a specialized and often challenging weed to manage. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the health and productivity of agricultural crops."
