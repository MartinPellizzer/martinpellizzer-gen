    "intro": "Oncidium jonesianum, commonly known as the Jonesian orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescences that bear numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and help store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shady environments. Oncidium jonesianum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
