It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting various pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
