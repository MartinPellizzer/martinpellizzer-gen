    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza lii, commonly known as the small-flowered mangrove, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Ophiorrhiza lii thrives in coastal areas, often found in mangrove ecosystems where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its unique adaptations allow it to tolerate saline conditions and fluctuating water levels."
