    "intro": "Oxypolis triquinata, commonly known as the three-lobed cow-wheat, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It produces small, dry fruits called legumes, which contain several seeds. Oxypolis triquinata is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
