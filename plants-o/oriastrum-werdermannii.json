    "intro": "Oriastrum werdermannii, commonly known as the Werdermann's globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open plains. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually palmately lobed, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Oriastrum werdermannii is part of the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is adapted to thrive in drought conditions."
