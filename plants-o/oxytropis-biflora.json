    "intro": "Oxytropis biflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish to greenish flowers in pairs, giving it its common name, and it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Oxytropis biflora is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through its root nodules, contributing to soil fertility. However, it is also considered toxic to livestock due to the presence of alkaloids."
