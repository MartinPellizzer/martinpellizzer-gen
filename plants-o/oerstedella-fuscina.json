    "intro": "Oerstedella fuscina, commonly known as the dark-stemmed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, dark green stems and small, pale green to brownish flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky slopes. Its botanical features include a short rhizome and a single, erect stem bearing a few flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
