    "intro": "Orchis militaris var. stevenii, commonly known as the Steven's soldier orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-rich soils. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific ecological conditions, making it sensitive to habitat disturbance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
