    "intro": "Ophrys tetuanensis, commonly known as the Tetuan bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy flower with intricate patterns and a specialized lip that enhances its mimicry. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
