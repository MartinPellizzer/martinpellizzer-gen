    "intro": "Oreophilus macroticus, commonly known as the giant mountain orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often with intricate patterns. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining substrates to prevent root rot. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to conserve moisture in its harsh mountainous habitat. Oreophilus macroticus plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
