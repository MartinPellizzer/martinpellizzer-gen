    "intro": "Osmia serrulata, commonly known as the serrated mason bee, is a solitary bee species native to North America. It is characterized by its dark, metallic blue body with distinctive serrated edges on its abdominal segments. The plant-related aspects of Osmia serrulata primarily involve its role as a pollinator, particularly for plants in the Apiaceae and Rosaceae families. These bees construct their nests in pre-existing cavities, such as hollow stems or artificial bee houses, rather than in plants. Their foraging behavior contributes to the ecological health of plant communities by facilitating cross-pollination."
