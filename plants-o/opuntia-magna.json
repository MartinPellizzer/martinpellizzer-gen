    "intro": "Opuntia magna, commonly known as the giant prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, flat, paddle-shaped stems that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and has a mild, sweet flavor. Opuntia magna is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and featuring spines for protection."
