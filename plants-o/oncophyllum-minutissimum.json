    "intro": "Oncophyllum minutissimum, commonly known as the dwarf sunflower, is a small flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has a compact growth habit, often reaching only a few inches in height, making it well-suited for rock gardens or containers. Its botanical features include hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Oncophyllum minutissimum is also notable for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and full sunlight."
