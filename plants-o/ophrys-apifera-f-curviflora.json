    "intro": "Ophrys apifera f. curviflora, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually yellow or brown with intricate patterns that aid in mimicry. This orchid is a protected species due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
