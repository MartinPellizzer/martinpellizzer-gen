    "intro": "Oxalis juninensis, commonly known as the Andean wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which resemble those of the common sorrel, and its delicate, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in cooler climates. Oxalis juninensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
