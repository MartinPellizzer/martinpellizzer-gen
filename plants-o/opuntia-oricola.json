    "intro": "Opuntia oricola, commonly known as the Ocotillo, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems that are covered in small, spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has adapted to arid environments by storing water in its stems. Opuntia oricola is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
