    "intro": "Osmunda regalis f. divisa, commonly known as the divided royal fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into narrow, linear segments. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with underground stems that produce both roots and new shoots. Its leaves, or fronds, are typically bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, giving the plant a delicate, lacy appearance. This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in garden settings with proper moisture and light conditions."
