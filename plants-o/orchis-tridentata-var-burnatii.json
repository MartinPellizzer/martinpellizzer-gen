    "intro": "Orchis tridentata var. burnatii, commonly known as Burnat's three-lobed orchid, is a rare orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive tridentate (three-lobed) labellum, which is a key feature in its identification. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous habitats such as meadows and woodlands. Its flowers are usually pink to purple in color, with a complex structure typical of orchids. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological traits."
