    "intro": "Orchis maculata f. falcata, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking purple and yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland areas, where it thrives in the presence of mycorrhizal fungi. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, while the flower spike is usually shorter than the leaves. This orchid is protected in many regions due to its declining population and specific habitat requirements."
