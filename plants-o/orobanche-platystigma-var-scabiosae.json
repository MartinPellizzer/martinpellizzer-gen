    "intro": "Orobanche platystigma var. scabiosae, commonly known as the scabious broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, fleshy stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in association with grasses and legumes. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
