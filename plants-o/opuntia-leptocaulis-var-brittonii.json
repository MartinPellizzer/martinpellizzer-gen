    "intro": "Opuntia leptocaulis var. brittonii, commonly known as the Britton's prickly pear, is a cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, ribbed stems that are covered in spines and are often used for ornamental purposes. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sunlight. Its botanical structure includes a succulent stem with areoles, which are specialized structures that bear spines, flowers, and branches."
