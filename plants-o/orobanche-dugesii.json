    "intro": "Orobanche dugesii, commonly known as the desert broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that belongs to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on species of the genus Astragalus. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
