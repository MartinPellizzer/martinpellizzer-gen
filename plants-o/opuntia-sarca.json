    "intro": "Opuntia sarca, commonly known as the narrow-leaved prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, green pads covered in spines and small, globose flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its succulent stems that store water. Opuntia sarca produces edible fruits, known as tunas, which are used in local cuisines. Its structure and growth patterns make it a notable example of xerophytic adaptation in desert ecosystems."
