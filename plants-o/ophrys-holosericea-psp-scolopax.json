    "intro": "Ophrys holosericea psp. scolopax, commonly known as the Scolopax orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which features a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats at high altitudes. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown in color, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
