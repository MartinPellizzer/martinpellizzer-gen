It is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine, reddish hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Ophiorrhiza rufipilis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and swampy areas."
