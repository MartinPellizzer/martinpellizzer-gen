    "intro": "Oedicephalus pseudonobilis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks traditional leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, which are specialized for aerial absorption. Its survival depends on specific environmental conditions, including high humidity and shade, making it highly sensitive to habitat disruption. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is listed as endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
