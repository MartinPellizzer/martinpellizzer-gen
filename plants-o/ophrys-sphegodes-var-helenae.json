    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes var. helenae, commonly known as the Helen's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
