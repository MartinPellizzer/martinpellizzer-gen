    "intro": "Odontites ruber subsp. vernus, commonly known as the red toothed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. Its small, pale blue to violet flowers appear in dense clusters during late spring to early summer. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local insect populations."
