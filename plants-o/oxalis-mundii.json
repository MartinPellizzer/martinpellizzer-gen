    "intro": "Oxalis mundii, commonly known as the desert star, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, rounded rosette of fleshy, pale green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. Oxalis mundii is well-suited for rock gardens or containers, requiring minimal water and full sun to partial shade."
