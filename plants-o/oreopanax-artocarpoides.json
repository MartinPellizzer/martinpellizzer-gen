    "intro": "Oreopanax artocarpoides, commonly known as the mountain breadfruit, is a tropical plant belonging to the Araliaceae family. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 50 cm in diameter, providing a distinctive visual feature. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, followed by woody, spiny fruits that contain several seeds. Native to the highlands of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and unique morphology, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
