    "intro": "Ophioglossum aletum, commonly known as the adder's tongue fern, is a unique and ancient fern species characterized by its distinctive morphology. It features a tall, erect spore-bearing stalk topped with a single, lance-shaped leaf that resembles a tongue, hence its common name. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures are specialized, with spores produced on the underside of the leaf. Ophioglossum aletum is notable for its primitive features, making it a valuable subject in the study of fern evolution."
