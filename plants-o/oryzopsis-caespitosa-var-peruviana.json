    "intro": "Oryzopsis caespitosa var. peruviana, commonly known as Peruvian needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to South America, particularly Peru and Bolivia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, and is adapted to withstand arid conditions. Its ecological role includes providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in its native environment."
