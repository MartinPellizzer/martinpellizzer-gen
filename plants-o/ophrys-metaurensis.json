    "intro": "Ophrys metaurensis, commonly known as the golden bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, with flowers that closely resemble female wasps, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are predominantly yellow with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects. The species is considered endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
