    "intro": "Ophrys clara, commonly known as the clear orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, bee-like flowers that are highly specialized for pollination by male bees. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers have a complex structure with a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, aiding in its unique pollination strategy. Ophrys clara is a rare and protected species, often requiring specific conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
