    "intro": "Orthaea ferreyrae, commonly known as the Ferreyra's orthaea, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped.
