    "intro": "Ononis hirta var. prostrata, commonly known as creeping whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are hairy and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites."
