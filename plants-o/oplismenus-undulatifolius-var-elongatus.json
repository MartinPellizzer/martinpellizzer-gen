    "intro": "Oplismenus undulatifolius var. elongatus, commonly known as the zigzag sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that exhibit a distinctive undulating pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist soils. This species is often found in marshes, pond edges, and other wetland habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems."
