    "intro": "Opuntia wootonii, commonly known as the Wooton's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and are often ribbed. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible. Opuntia wootonii is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
