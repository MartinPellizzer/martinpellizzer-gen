It features a robust rhizome and produces tall, erect stems that bear lance-shaped leaves. The plant is notable for its striking, showy flowers, which are typically pink or purple with dark markings. The inflorescence consists of a spike of flowers, each surrounded by a modified leaf called a bract. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
