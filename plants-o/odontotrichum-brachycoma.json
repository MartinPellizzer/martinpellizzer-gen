    "intro": "Odontotrichum brachycoma, commonly known as the short-stemmed toothed grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats or cushions, adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions such as cold temperatures and strong winds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with small, tooth-like projections along the edges, giving it its scientific name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. Odontotrichum brachycoma plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in rocky or sandy substrates."
