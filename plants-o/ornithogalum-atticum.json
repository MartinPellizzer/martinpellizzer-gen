It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that help it survive harsh conditions. Ornithogalum atticum is also known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
