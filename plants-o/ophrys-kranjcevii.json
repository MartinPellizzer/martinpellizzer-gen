    "intro": "Ophrys kranjcevii, commonly known as the Kranjcevii bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkans. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in subalpine and alpine environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
