    "intro": "Orchis graggeriana, commonly known as the purple orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, with three sepals and three petals, one of which is prominently spurred. Orchis graggeriana is also noted for its rhizomatous root system, which helps it thrive in nutrient-rich soils."
