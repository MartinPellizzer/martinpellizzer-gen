    "intro": "Oxybaphus multiflorus, commonly known as the many-flowered oxypetalum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and extended flowering period."
