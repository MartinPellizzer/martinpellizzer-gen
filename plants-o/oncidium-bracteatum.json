    "intro": "Oncidium bracteatum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling a cascade of golden bells. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are strap-like, fleshy, and arranged in a fan shape, typical of many orchid species. Oncidium bracteatum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
