    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 pseudotraunsteineri, commonly known as the Traunsteiner's orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis mascula. It is a perennial herbaceous plant with tall, erect stems that bear showy, butterfly-shaped flowers in shades of pink and purple. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are characterized by a prominent lip that serves as a landing platform for pollinators. Orchis \u00d7 pseudotraunsteineri is native to parts of Europe and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a hybrid species that exemplifies the genetic diversity within the Orchidaceae family."
