    "intro": "Ophioglossum louisii, commonly known as the Louisiana adder's-tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, primitive morphology, featuring a single, strap-like leaf that arises from a short, underground rhizome. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile leaf, which are clustered in a distinctive, tongue-shaped structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as hardwood forests and wetlands. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered in many regions."
