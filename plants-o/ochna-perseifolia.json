    "intro": "Ochna perseifolia, commonly known as the African star-of-Bethlehem, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that resemble the shape of a star, and its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Ochna perseifolia is often used in ornamental gardening for its unique foliage and seasonal floral display."
