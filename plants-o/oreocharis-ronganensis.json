    "intro": "Oreocharis ronganensis, commonly known as the Rongan star-flower, is a rare and endemic plant species native to China. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its leaves are heart-shaped and glossy, adding to its ornamental value. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Oreocharis ronganensis is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
