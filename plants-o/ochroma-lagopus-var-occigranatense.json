    "intro": "Ochroma lagopus var. occigranatense, commonly known as the granulated balsa, is a variant of the balsa tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its light, porous wood, which is one of the lightest known woods in the world. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptical in shape. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round fruits containing numerous seeds. This variant is valued for its unique grain pattern and is often used in model making and lightweight construction."
