    "intro": "Otites donetzicus, commonly known as the Donetsky otites, is a flowering plant native to the steppes of Eastern Europe. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
