    "intro": "Ophrys aramaeorum, commonly known as the Alaskan bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its unique flower structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in small, scattered populations. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Ophrys aramaeorum is considered a vulnerable species."
