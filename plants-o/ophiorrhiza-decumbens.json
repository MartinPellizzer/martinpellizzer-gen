    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate mangrove or swamp mangrove, is a small, shrub-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its decumbent (lying prostrate) growth habit, with branches often trailing along the ground. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Ophiorrhiza decumbens is often found in coastal areas, estuaries, and wetlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
