    "intro": "Oncoba mannii, commonly known as the African starfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to West Africa. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, with a broad, spreading canopy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, star-shaped fruits that are similar to those of the common starfruit. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a smooth texture with a slightly serrated margin. Oncoba mannii is valued for its fruit, which is often consumed fresh or used in local cuisines."
