    "intro": "Olea angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf olive, is a small evergreen tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are typically harvested when they turn from green to black. Olea angustifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has historical uses in traditional medicine. Its adaptability to arid conditions makes it a resilient species in its native habitat."
