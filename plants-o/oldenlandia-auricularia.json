    "intro": "Oldenlandia auricularia, commonly known as the earleaf false arum, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble those of true arums. The plant typically grows as an annual or short-lived perennial, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a distinctive appearance. The flowers are usually pale green or white, with a spatulate or hooded shape, and are often accompanied by a fleshy, leaf-like bract."
