    "intro": "Oldeania marojejyensis, commonly known as the Marojejy lily, is a rare flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in the humid and nutrient-rich soil of its native habitat. Its bulbs are adapted for storage, allowing it to survive in the tropical climate of its environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, Oldeania marojejyensis is considered an endangered species."
