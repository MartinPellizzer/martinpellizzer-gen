    "intro": "Ononis stricta, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of western Asia. It is a low-growing annual or biennial plant with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Sand verbena is valued for its ability to stabilize soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
