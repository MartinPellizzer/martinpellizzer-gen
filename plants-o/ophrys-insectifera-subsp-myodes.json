    "intro": "Ophrys insectifera subsp. myodes, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a specialized labellum that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. It thrives in dry, calcareous grasslands and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
