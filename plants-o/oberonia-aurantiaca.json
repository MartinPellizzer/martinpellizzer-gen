    "intro": "Oberonia aurantiaca, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and its striking orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has fleshy, dark green leaves and produces small, yellowish-green pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and moderate temperatures for optimal growth. Oberonia aurantiaca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
