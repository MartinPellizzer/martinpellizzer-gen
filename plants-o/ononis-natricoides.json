    "intro": "Ononis natricoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Leguminosae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces legume pods that contain several seeds. Ononis natricoides is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
