    "intro": "Oncidium reversum, commonly known as the reverse orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, racemose inflorescence with showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or green with contrasting markings. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are strap-like and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Oncidium reversum is popular in horticulture for its long-lasting blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
