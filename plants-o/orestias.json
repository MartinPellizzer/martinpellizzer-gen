    "intro": "Orestias, commonly known as the Andean shieldfish, is a genus of freshwater fish native to South America. These fish are characterized by their unique, flattened bodies and specialized gill structures that allow them to thrive in high-altitude, oxygen-rich environments. Orestias species are often found in lakes and rivers at elevations above 3,000 meters, where they have adapted to cold, fast-flowing waters. Their botanical significance lies in their role as indicators of aquatic biodiversity in Andean ecosystems. Due to their restricted habitats, many Orestias species are threatened by environmental changes and habitat degradation."
