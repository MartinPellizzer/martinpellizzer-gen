    "intro": "Ophrys fuciflora f. brachyotus, commonly known as the short-leaved orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species found in specific alpine environments. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, lip-like flowers that mimic the appearance of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant has reduced leaves compared to the typical species, giving it its common name. It thrives in high-altitude regions with cool, moist conditions, often in rocky or mountainous areas. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
