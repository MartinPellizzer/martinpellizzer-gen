    "intro": "Orobanche reticulata subsp. reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its small, showy, often yellow or orange flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, attaching itself to the roots of host species such as legumes and grasses. Its life cycle involves germination triggered by chemical signals from the host, after which it establishes a haustorium to tap into the host's vascular system. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of agricultural crops."
