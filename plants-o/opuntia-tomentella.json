    "intro": "Opuntia tomentella, commonly known as the wooly prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in dense, white, woolly hair. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in arid environments. Opuntia tomentella is well adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems."
