    "intro": "Orchis bifolia, commonly known as the two-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive two-leaf structure at the base of the plant, which is a key identifying feature. The plant produces showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Orchis bifolia typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitats."
