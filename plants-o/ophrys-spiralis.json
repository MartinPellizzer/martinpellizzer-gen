    "intro": "Ophrys spiralis, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique, intricate flower structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait known as pseudocopulation. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with a distinctive spiral pattern on the lip. Ophrys spiralis is a perennial herb that produces a single, showy flower per stem, often appearing in late spring to early summer."
