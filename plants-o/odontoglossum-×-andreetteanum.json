    "intro": "Odontoglossum \u00d7 andreetteanum, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a cross between two species of the Odontoglossum genus. It is a herbaceous plant native to the Andean regions of South America, where it thrives in high-altitude cloud forests. The plant features showy, fragrant flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It has a sympodial growth habit, producing new shoots from the base of the old ones. The leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat."
