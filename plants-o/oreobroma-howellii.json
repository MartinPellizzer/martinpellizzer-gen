    "intro": "Oreobroma howellii, commonly known as Howell's mountainstar, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at higher elevations, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Oreobroma howellii is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in full sun."
