    "intro": "Omphalea triandra var. robusta, commonly known as the African arrowroot or wild arrowroot, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its erect stem, which can grow up to 3 meters in height, and its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by distinctive yellow to orange berries containing toxic seeds. It is adapted to grow in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
