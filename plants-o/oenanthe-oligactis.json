It typically grows in moist, wetland habitats such as marshes and stream banks. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, arrow-shaped leaves that are usually less than 2 cm in length. Its flowers are white or pale green and are arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Oenanthe oligactis is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and lakes."
