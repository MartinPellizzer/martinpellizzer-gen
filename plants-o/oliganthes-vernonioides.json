    "intro": "Oliganthes vernonioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, showcasing its adaptability to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. The flowers are yellow and bloom in early spring, contributing to its role in supporting pollinators."
