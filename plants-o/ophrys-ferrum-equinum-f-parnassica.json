    "intro": "Ophrys ferrum-equinum f. parnassica, commonly known as the Parnassian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown, with intricate patterns that aid in mimicry. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this orchid is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
