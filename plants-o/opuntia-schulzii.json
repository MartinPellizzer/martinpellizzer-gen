    "intro": "Opuntia schulzii, commonly known as the Schultze's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia schulzii is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It plays an important role in local ecosystems and is also valued for its ornamental and culinary uses."
