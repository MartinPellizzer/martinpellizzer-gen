    "intro": "Onosma pseudoarenaria subsp. delphinensis, commonly known as the Delphinian wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the rocky and arid regions of the Mediterranean. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant blue to purple flowers. The plant typically produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
