    "intro": "Orobanche sarmatica, commonly known as the European broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish to reddish stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. This species typically parasitizes members of the legume family, such as Vicia and Astragalus, by attaching to their roots with specialized structures called haustoria. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth patterns of its host, making it an important subject in studies of plant parasitism. Due to its lack of leaves and photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its habitat."
