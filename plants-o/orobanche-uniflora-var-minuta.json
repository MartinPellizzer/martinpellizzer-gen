    "intro": "Orobanche uniflora var. minuta, commonly known as the dwarf common broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that belongs to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing species within the Brassicaceae family. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a single umbel, which is a distinctive botanical feature. It is found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in sandy or disturbed soils. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native habitat."
