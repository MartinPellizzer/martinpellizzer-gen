    "intro": "Oreocereus variicolor var. tacnaensis, commonly known as the Tacna orchid cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the Andean region of Peru. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and clusters of showy, white to pinkish flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant has thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Its flowers are typically fragrant and attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in some areas."
