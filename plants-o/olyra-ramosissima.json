    "intro": "Olyra ramosissima, commonly known as the African milkwood tree, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, often flaky bark and a sprawling, multi-branched structure. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by woody, spherical pods containing several seeds. The tree is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
