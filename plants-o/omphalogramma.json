    "intro": "Omphalogramma, commonly known as the \"milkweed of the desert,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Europe. The plants typically have hairy stems and alternate leaves, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Their flowers are usually small and clustered, often in umbels, and come in shades of yellow, orange, or red. Omphalogramma species are adapted to harsh environments, making them resilient to drought and high temperatures."
