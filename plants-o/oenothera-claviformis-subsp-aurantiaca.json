    "intro": "Oenothera claviformis subsp. aurantiaca, commonly known as the orange evening primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its showy, orange-yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically borne in clusters at the ends of the stems, and the plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Oenothera claviformis subsp. aurantiaca is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils."
