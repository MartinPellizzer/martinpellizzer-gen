    "intro": "Odontotrichum cirsiifolium, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive woolly texture, while its flowers are clustered in dense heads. Odontotrichum cirsiifolium is adapted to arid environments and has a slow growth rate, making it a resilient member of its ecosystem."
