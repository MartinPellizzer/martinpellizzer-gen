It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps.
