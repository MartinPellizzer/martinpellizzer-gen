    "intro": "Opuntia icterica, commonly known as the yellow prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems that are covered in sharp spines and glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia icterica is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy pads. Its structure and growth patterns make it a notable example of xerophytic adaptation in the desert ecosystem."
