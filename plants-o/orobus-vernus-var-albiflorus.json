    "intro": "Orobus vernus var. albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pale pink, often arranged in clusters at the top of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a common sight in woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in the wild."
