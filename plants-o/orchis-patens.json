It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are borne in racemes and are pollinated by insects, particularly bees. Orchis patens is known for its ornamental value and is often found in conservation areas due to its declining populations."
