    "intro": "Odontochilus aureus, commonly known as the golden toothed orchid, is a small, epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically has dark green, ovate leaves with a velvety texture and a faintly hairy surface. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and rarity, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value."
