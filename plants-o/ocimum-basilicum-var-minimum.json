    "intro": "Ocimum basilicum var. minimum, commonly known as dwarf basil, is a compact variety of sweet basil characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and compact growth habit. It is native to tropical regions and thrives in warm, sunny climates with well-drained soil. This variety is often used in culinary applications due to its flavorful leaves, which are similar to traditional basil but with a slightly more intense aroma. Its smaller size makes it ideal for container gardening and indoor cultivation. The plant produces small white flowers, which can be left to self-seed or removed for ornamental purposes."
