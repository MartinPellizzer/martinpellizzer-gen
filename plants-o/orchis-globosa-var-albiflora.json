    "intro": "Orchis globosa var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered globeflower, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its globular, pale yellow to white floral structure, which is unique among orchids. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it is often found in the northern hemisphere. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
