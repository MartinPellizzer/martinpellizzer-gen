    "intro": "Ornithidium parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flower orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, terrestrial growth habit and produces small, delicate flowers with a distinctive greenish-yellow color. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the soil, and it has a symbiotic relationship with certain mycorrhizal fungi. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
