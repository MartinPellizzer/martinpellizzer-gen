    "intro": "Orobanche gracilis subsp. gracilis, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, typically in late summer. It has a slender, branching stem and small, scale-like leaves. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of its host plants."
