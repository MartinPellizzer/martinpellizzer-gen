    "intro": "Orchis mascula lusus rosea, commonly known as the pink twayblade, is a rare and fascinating orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a striking pink or purple flower spike that typically blooms in late spring. The plant is a hemiparasite, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. Its flowers are often pollinated by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological significance. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many regions, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
