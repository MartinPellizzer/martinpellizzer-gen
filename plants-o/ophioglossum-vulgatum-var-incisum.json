    "intro": "Ophioglossum vulgatum var. incisum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species characterized by its distinctive, tongue-shaped spore-bearing leaf. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae and is native to parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. The plant has a unique morphology with a short, erect stem and a single, lanceolate leaf that is often divided into two parts. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the leaf, and it produces spores rather than seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in many regions."
