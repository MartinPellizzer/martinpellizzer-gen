    "intro": "Oreocarya cinerea, commonly known as the gray oreocarya, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its grayish-green foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white or gray hairs, which help reduce water loss. Oreocarya cinerea is adapted to harsh conditions and is often found in mountainous regions."
