    "intro": "Osmunda bipinnata, commonly known as the royal fern, is a species of fern characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds. It is native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada, typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a distinctive underground rhizome system that supports its growth and reproduction. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged on the underside of the fronds. Osmunda bipinnata plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
