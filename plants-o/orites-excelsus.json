    "intro": "Orites excelsus, commonly known as the highland orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is typically found at high elevations where competition from other plants is minimal. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, Orites excelsus is considered endangered and is protected in several national parks."
