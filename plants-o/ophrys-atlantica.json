    "intro": "Ophrys atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance and scent of female bees, a phenomenon known as sexual deception. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by bees. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Ophrys atlantica is considered endangered in many parts of its native range."
