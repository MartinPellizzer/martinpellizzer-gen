    "intro": "Otidia alternans, commonly known as the alternate leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that alternate along the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of fine roots, which help anchor it to the substrate. Otidia alternans is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
