    "intro": "Oxalis corniculata var. minor, commonly known as the small-leaf wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to Asia, particularly China and Japan. It is a low-growing perennial herb with trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers that resemble those of true sorrel. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a distinctive reddish or purple tinge on the underside, and it produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds. Oxalis corniculata var. minor is also known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
