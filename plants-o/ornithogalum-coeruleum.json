    "intro": "Ornithogalum coeruleum, commonly known as blue star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of star-shaped, blue to violet flowers in late spring. The plant is characterized by its bulbous underground stem, which stores nutrients for growth. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Ornithogalum coeruleum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
