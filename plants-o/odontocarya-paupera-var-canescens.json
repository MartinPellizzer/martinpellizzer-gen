    "intro": "Odontocarya paupera var. canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf odontocarya, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes caraway and parsley, and is known for its aromatic properties. This variety is often found growing in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in low-water conditions."
