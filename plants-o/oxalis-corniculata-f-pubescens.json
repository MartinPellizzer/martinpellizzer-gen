It is a low-growing perennial that features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that resemble those of true sorrels, often with five petals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The hairy pubescence on its stems and leaves gives it its specific epithet, \"pubescens.\""
