    "intro": "Oerstedella pseudoschumanniana, commonly known as the Schumann's false oerstedella, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple, often clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant prefers well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to grow in arid or semi-arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
