    "intro": "Oncidium variegatum var. roseum, commonly known as the Roseum Oncidium, is a hybrid orchid species originating from South America. It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting flowers that range in color from pink to white, often with a subtle rose hue. The plant typically produces racemes of fragrant, spurred flowers that bloom sequentially over several weeks. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This orchid is popular among growers for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
