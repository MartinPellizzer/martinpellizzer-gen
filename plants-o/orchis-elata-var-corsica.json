    "intro": "Orchis elata var. corsica, commonly known as the Corsican orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica and Sardinia. It is a perennial herb with a tall, upright stem that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers arranged in a loose spike, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodlands or rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
