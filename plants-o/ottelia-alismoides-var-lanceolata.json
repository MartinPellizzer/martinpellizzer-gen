    "intro": "Ottelia alismoides var. lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water plantain, is a semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features long, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white, flower clusters that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize wetland habitats. Ottelia alismoides var. lanceolata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic life."
