    "intro": "Oreocnide frutescens subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as the western silverbush, is a shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along streambanks. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The species is adapted to withstand drought and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
