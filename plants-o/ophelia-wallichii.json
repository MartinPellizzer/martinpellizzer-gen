    "intro": "Ophelia wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan water plant, is a semi-aquatic flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as lakes and ponds. The plant features narrow, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots hang below, providing oxygenation to the water. Ophelia wallichii produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
