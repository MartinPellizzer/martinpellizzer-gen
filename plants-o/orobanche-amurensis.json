    "intro": "Orobanche amurensis, commonly known as the Amur broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or reddish stems and small, scale-like leaves. This species typically attaches to the roots of host plants such as legumes and grasses, forming a haustorium to extract water and nutrients. It is native to regions of East Asia, including Russia and China, and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on agricultural crops and natural ecosystems."
