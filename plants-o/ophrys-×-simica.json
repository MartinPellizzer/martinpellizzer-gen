Its flowers closely resemble female bees, a characteristic that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Europe, particularly the Mediterranean region. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its botanical features include a slender stem, lance-shaped leaves, and a single, highly specialized flower that attracts male bees for pollination."
