    "intro": "Otholobium obliquum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved burr medick, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces spherical, hairy pods that contain several seeds, typical of many leguminous species. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Otholobium obliquum plays a role in soil stabilization and can be used in rehabilitation of degraded lands."
