    "intro": "Oberonia basilanensis, commonly known as the Basilan orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in a spiral pattern. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually long and strap-like, and it prefers humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
