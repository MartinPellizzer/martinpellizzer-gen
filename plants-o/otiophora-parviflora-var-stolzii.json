It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, typically along the stems rather than at the ends. The plant has dense, evergreen foliage with small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardening."
