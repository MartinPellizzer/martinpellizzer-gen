    "intro": "Oxystylis, commonly known as the African bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. They are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. Oxystylis species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, often with woody stems and opposite leaves. The flowers are often visited by insects, making them important for pollination in their native habitats."
