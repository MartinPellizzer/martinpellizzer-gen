    "intro": "Opopanax armenus, commonly known as Armenian opoponax, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Burseraceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid climates. The plant is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and produces yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. Its resin, similar to frankincense and myrrh, has been historically used in traditional medicine and perfumery. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
