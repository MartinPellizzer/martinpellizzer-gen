    "intro": "Ononis mauritanica, commonly known as the Mauritania hedge-grown or desert honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, characterized by its woody stems and dense foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Ononis mauritanica is well-suited for xeriscaping and can thrive in poor soils, making it a valuable plant for ecological restoration in degraded landscapes."
