    "intro": "Ochlandra sivagiriana, commonly known as the Sivagiri orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and long, linear leaves. The plant produces striking, pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip that is often marked with purple or brown streaks. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in dense forests at higher elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
