The plant has a thick, woody trunk and produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, tropical or subtropical climates. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
