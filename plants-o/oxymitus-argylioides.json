It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, powdery hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid regions."
