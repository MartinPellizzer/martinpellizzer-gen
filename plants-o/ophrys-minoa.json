    "intro": "Ophrys minoa, commonly known as the Greek Orchid or the Minotaur Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate, lip-like flower that resembles a female face, a feature that plays a role in its unique pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in spring, producing a delicate, greenish-yellow color with a distinctively shaped lip. Ophrys minoa is notable for its evolutionary adaptation, where the floral structure mimics the appearance of a female insect to attract male pollinators."
