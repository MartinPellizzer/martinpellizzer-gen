    "intro": "Oligosporus parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered spore plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Olacaceae and is characterized by its compact stature and delicate, small white flowers. The plant's leaves are simple and opposite, with a velvety texture that distinguishes it from other species in the genus. Its reproductive system relies on wind pollination, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain a single seed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oligosporus parviflorus is considered a species of conservation concern."
