    "intro": "Odontotrichum napellifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, with petals that are narrowly lanceolate in shape. Its leaves are linear to oblanceolate, often hairy, and arranged in a rosette or along the stems. Odontotrichum napellifolium is notable for its adaptation to cold, arid environments and its role in stabilizing soil in rocky landscapes."
