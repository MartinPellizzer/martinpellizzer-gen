    "intro": "Oxychloe simulans, commonly known as the false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands, often forming dense clumps. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, two-lipped flowers. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
