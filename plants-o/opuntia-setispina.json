    "intro": "Opuntia setispina, commonly known as the spiny prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its flat, spine-covered stems that are often ribbed and can store water efficiently. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia setispina thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to hot, dry climates. Its structure and growth habits make it a notable species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
