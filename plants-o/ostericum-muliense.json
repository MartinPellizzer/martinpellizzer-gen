    "intro": "Ostericum muliense, commonly known as the Muliense Ostericum, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, with a subtle, spicy scent. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ostericum muliense is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
