    "intro": "Orchis maculata immaculata, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, purple or violet flowers with distinctive dark spots. Native to specific regions of Europe, this plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland habitats. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
