    "intro": "Oncidium crista-galli, commonly known as the Spur Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated pseudobulbs and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant produces long, slender inflorescences with numerous flowers arranged in a spiral pattern, giving it a unique and elegant appearance. Oncidium crista-galli is a sympodial orchid, meaning it grows in segments, and requires bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive. It is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers."
