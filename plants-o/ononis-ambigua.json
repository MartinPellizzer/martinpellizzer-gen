    "intro": "Ononis ambigua, commonly known as the common ononea, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Ononis ambigua is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in well-drained environments."
