    "intro": "Oxandra ovata, commonly known as the oval-leaf oxandra, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are usually arranged oppositely on the stems. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, woody fruits containing elliptical seeds. Oxandra ovata is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and potential medicinal applications."
