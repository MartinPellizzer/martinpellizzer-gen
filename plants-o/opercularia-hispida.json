    "intro": "Opercularia hispida, commonly known as the hispid operculary, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale yellow to orange in color. The lichen forms a crust-like growth on tree bark, rocks, and soil, often in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, known as soredia, are produced in small, round masses on the upper surface of the thallus. Opercularia hispida is a slow-growing species that is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
