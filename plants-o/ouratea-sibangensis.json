    "intro": "Ouratea sibangensis, commonly known as the Sibang tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the Philippines and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered white flowers. The plant typically grows as a tall, slender tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 15 meters. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a leathery texture, while its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
