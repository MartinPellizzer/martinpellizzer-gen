    "intro": "Ophrys aranifera subsp. aesculapii, commonly known as the sacred orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-mimicking flowers that play a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or scrubland habitats. Its floral structure includes a well-developed lip that resembles a female bee, aiding in deceptive pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
