It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
