    "intro": "Oxytropis viridiflava, commonly known as the green-flowered locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, and its root system is often deep and extensive. It is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is sometimes considered a noxious weed due to its allelopathic properties."
