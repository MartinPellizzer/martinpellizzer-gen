    "intro": "Ononis maweana var. angustata, commonly known as narrowleaf sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Native to southern Africa, this plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open, sun-exposed habitats. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, particularly in regions with Mediterranean climates."
