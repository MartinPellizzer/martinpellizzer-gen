    "intro": "Oncidium insigne, commonly known as the showy orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, pendulous flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Oncidium insigne is prized for its long-lasting blooms and is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
