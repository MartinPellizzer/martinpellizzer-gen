    "intro": "Oligochaetochilus mitchellii, commonly known as the Mitchell's featherroot, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy roots and small, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in dense undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
