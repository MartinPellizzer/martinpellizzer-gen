    "intro": "Oplismenus repens, commonly known as white clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. Oplismenus repens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along roadsides. It is a member of the legume family and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria."
