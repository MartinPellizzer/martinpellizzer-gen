    "intro": "Oxalis cernua var. namaquana, commonly known as the Namibian wood sorrel, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial native to southern Africa. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a heart-shaped base and small, dainty flowers that range from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. It is drought-tolerant and often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its ornamental appeal. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions."
