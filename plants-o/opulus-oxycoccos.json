    "intro": "Opulus oxycoccos, commonly known as the whitebeam or rowan tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans and livestock. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Opulus oxycoccos is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
