It features a short, tuberous rhizome and produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is notable for its toxic properties, containing alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals. Despite its toxicity, it is appreciated for its ornamental value in gardens."
