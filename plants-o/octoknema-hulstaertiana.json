    "intro": "Octoknema hulstaertiana, commonly known as the Hulstert's octoknema, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and quinine. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed, and it is often found in shaded, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species in botanical studies."
