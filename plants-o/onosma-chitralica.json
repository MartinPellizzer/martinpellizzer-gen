    "intro": "Onosma chitralica, commonly known as the Chitral onosma, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan region, particularly in northern Pakistan and northern India. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and hairy foliage. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
