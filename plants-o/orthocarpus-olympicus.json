    "intro": "Orthocarpus olympicus, commonly known as the Olympic orthocarpus, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and it produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
