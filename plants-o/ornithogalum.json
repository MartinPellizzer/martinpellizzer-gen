    "intro": "Ornithogalum, commonly known as the star of Bethlehem, is a genus of flowering plants in the asparagales order. These plants are characterized by their striking, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in spring. They are native to southern Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, often growing in woodland or grassland habitats. The leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while the bulbs are an important part of their anatomy for storage and propagation. Ornithogalum species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and have historical uses in traditional medicine."
