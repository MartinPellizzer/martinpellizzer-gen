It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, red or orange fruits that contain one or two seeds.

The species is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been historically used in construction and carving."
