    "intro": "Oberonia watuwilensis, commonly known as the Waturwil orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the rainforests of New Guinea. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit, often found growing on tree trunks or branches. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming during the wet season. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Oberonia watuwilensis is considered critically endangered."
