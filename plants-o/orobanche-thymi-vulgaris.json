    "intro": "Orobanche thymi-vulgaris, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true roots and its ability to attach to the roots of host plants such as thyme and other members of the Lamiaceae family. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often pale yellow or greenish in color. It is found in various regions of Europe and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
