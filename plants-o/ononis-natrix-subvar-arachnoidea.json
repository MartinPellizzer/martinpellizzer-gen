    "intro": "Ononis natrix subvar. arachnoidea, commonly known as the spider-like sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in early summer. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, thread-like trichomes. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
