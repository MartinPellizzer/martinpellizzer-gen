    "intro": "Oncidium semele, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, arching inflorescences that bear clusters of bright yellow, butterfly-like flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Oncidium semele is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
