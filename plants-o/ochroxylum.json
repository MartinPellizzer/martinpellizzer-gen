    "intro": "Ochroxylum, commonly known as the genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae, includes several species native to the Americas. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. They are often found in arid or semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Some species of Ochroxylum are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The genus is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
