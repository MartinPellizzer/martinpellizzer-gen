    "intro": "Ophrys creberrima, commonly known as the common bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern and eastern Europe. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201340 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, showy flower that mimics the appearance of a female bee. Its flowers are pollinated by male bees through a process called sexual deception, where the orchid lures the bees to transfer pollen. This species thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often in calcareous soils."
