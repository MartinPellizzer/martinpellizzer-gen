    "intro": "Oreosolen unguiculatus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in furniture and carving. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in dense forests or along riverbanks. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
