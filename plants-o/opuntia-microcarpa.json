    "intro": "Opuntia microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stem segments called cladodes, which are covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by small, red, fleshy fruits. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Opuntia microcarpa is also known for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of food for both humans and animals."
