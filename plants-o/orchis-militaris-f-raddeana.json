    "intro": "Orchis militaris f. raddeana, commonly known as the Radde's military orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns and a unique, spurred lip. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor environments. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this orchid is considered endangered in many regions."
