    "intro": "Ononis masquillierii, commonly known as the Maltese rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, spiny stems. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Ononis masquillierii is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient plant in coastal and mountainous environments."
