    "intro": "Ornithogalum nitidum, commonly known as the white star lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, giving them a shiny appearance. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that help the plant survive dry periods. Ornithogalum nitidum is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
