It is a succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy leaves adapted to store water. The plant produces striking, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It blooms during the wet season, usually in late winter or early spring. Orbea kaokoensis is well-suited to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
