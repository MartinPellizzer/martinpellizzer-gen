    "intro": "Odontocarya septemfida, commonly known as the seven-lobed rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it its scientific name \"septemfida,\" which refers to the seven divisions of the leaf lobes. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and are arranged in racemes, adding to its ornamental appeal. Odontocarya septemfida is valued for its resilience and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a wildflower in suitable climates."
