    "intro": "Otiophora lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is usually greenish to yellowish in color and has a leathery texture. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which provides it with nutrients through photosynthesis. It typically grows on rocky surfaces in cool, moist environments, often found in forested areas. Otiophora lanceolata is relatively rare and is considered a indicator species for specific ecological conditions."
