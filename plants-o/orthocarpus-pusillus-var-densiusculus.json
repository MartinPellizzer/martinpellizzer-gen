    "intro": "Orthocarpus pusillus var. densiusculus, commonly known as the dense-leaved orthocarpus, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Its dense foliage and compact growth habit make it an attractive, low-maintenance plant for rock gardens and native plant collections."
