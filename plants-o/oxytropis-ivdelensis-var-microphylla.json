    "intro": "Oxytropis ivdelensis var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved ivdel oxytropis, is a member of the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, ovate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces yellow to orange pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in steppe and semi-desert environments. This variety is noted for its low-growing form and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies due to its adaptation to arid conditions."
