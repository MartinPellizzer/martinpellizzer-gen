    "intro": "Ototropis, commonly known as the narrowleaf false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. Ototropis species are typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. They are perennial herbs that often have hairy stems and are adapted to thrive in temperate climates. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional herbal medicine."
