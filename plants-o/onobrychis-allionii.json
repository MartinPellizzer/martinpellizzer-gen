    "intro": "Onobrychis allionii, commonly known as the Allion's goat's rue, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, rocky soils across parts of Europe and western Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, upright clusters, which are characteristic of the genus Onobrychis. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The plant is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial in ecological restoration projects."
