    "intro": "Ophrys scolopax var. santonica, commonly known as the red helleborine, is a species of orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and striking, lip-like petals that mimic the appearance of female insects, a trait known as sexual deception. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flowers with a distinctive, darkly veined lip that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. The variety santonica is distinguished by its slightly different floral structure and coloration compared to the typical form of Ophrys scolopax."
