    "intro": "Orchis ciliaris, commonly known as the ear orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that are often violet or purple in color. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and can be found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, while the flowers are arranged in a loose spike and are often adorned with hairy structures. The orchid has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption, making it an important species in certain ecosystems."
