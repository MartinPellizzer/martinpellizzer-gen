    "intro": "Oligochaetochilus bracteatus, commonly known as the bracteate mossy orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, intricate flowers and is often found growing in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky areas. The plant has a unique growth habit, with its roots forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in its habitat. Its leaves are typically leathery and covered in fine hairs, which aid in moisture retention. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
