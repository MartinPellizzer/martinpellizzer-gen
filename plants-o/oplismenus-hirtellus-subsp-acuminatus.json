    "intro": "Oplismenus hirtellus subsp. acuminatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered purple to pink flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist to wet soils in woodland or wetland habitats. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
