    "intro": "Orchis incarnata f. haematodes, commonly known as the blood orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family characterized by its vivid red and purple floral bracts. This plant is native to moist woodlands and meadows in eastern North America, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil. The inflorescence consists of a dense spike of showy, lip-like flowers that are often tinged with orange or red, adding to its ornamental appeal. It is a perennial herb that produces a single, tall stem bearing numerous flowers, which are pollinated by various insects. The plant's unique coloration and ecological role make it a notable species in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
