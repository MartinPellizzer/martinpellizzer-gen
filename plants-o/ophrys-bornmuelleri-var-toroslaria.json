    "intro": "Ophrys bornmuelleri var. toroslaria, commonly known as the Toroslaria orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which includes a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female insect, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in mountainous areas with a temperate climate. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
