    "intro": "Orthocarpus erianthus var. micranthus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright stems covered in stiff, spiny leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
