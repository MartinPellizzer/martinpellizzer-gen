    "intro": "Orobus canescens var. sessilifolius, commonly known as the sessile-leaved orobus, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, grayish hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are sessile, meaning they attach directly to the stem without a stalk, and are typically narrow and linear. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, and range in color from pale yellow to greenish-white. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
