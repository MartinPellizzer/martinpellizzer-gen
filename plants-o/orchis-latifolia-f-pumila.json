    "intro": "Orchis latifolia f. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf broad-leaved orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with shorter stems and smaller leaves compared to the typical form of Orchis latifolia. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a striking visual element to its habitat. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or meadow environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
