    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. balatensis, commonly known as the Balatensis rice, is a less commonly cultivated variety of rice native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and small, slender grains. The plant typically reaches a height of 100\u2013150 cm and produces panicles that are often shorter than those of other rice varieties. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, requiring warm temperatures and ample water for optimal growth. Botanically, it is notable for its genetic diversity, which makes it a valuable resource for rice breeding programs."
