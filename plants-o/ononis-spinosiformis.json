    "intro": "Ononis spinosiformis, commonly known as the spiny flax or desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with woody stems that are often covered in sharp, spiny bracts. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils and withstand drought conditions. Ononis spinosiformis plays a role in stabilizing soil in desert environments and provides forage for certain wildlife species."
