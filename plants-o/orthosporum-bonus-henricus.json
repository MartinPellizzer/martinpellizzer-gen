    "intro": "Orthosporum bonus-henricus, commonly known as the Henry's orthosporum, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of North America. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and often grows in association with other shade-tolerant flora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
