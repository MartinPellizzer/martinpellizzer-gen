It is characterized by its small, dense growth habit and its ability to colonize crevices in stones. The plant has a thalloid structure, with a flat, leaf-like body that is typically green or reddish in color. It is often found in shaded, moist habitats such as forest floors or along stream banks. Oligochaetochilus saxicola plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms."
