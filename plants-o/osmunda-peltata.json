    "intro": "Osmunda peltata, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, glossy, dark green fronds that resemble a cinnamon stick, hence its common name. The plant has a short, stout rhizome that supports its tall, upright fronds. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Osmunda peltata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
