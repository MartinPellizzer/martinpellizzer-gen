    "intro": "[WRONG START] Ornu rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf alder, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-9 inches long. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that contains several seeds. Ornus rotundifolia is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in floodplain forests."
