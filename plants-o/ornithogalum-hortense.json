It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens due to its elegant appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. However, it is toxic, containing compounds that can be harmful to humans and animals if ingested."
