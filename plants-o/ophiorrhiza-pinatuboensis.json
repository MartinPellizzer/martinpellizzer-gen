    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza pinatuboensis, commonly known as the Philippine sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the Philippines and thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in lowland and montane forests. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. It produces small, round berries that are often dispersed by birds. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
