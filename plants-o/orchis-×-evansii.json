    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 evansii, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to wetland habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along riverbanks. Its flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, with three sepals and three petals, one of which is modified into a lip. Orchis \u00d7 evansii plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for various pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
