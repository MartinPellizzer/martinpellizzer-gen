    "intro": "Opuntia exuviatostellata, commonly known as the star-stemmed prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems that are covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is adapted to arid environments. Opuntia exuviatostellata is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant."
