It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, triangular leaves that often resemble the feet of a hare. The flowers are typically arranged in clusters and are usually pink or purple in color. Ochotonophila species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and North America. These plants are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
