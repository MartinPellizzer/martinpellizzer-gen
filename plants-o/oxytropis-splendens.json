It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and yellow flowers. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, and it is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Oxytropis splendens is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important species in its native range."
