It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking white petals and vibrant yellow lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, often found on rock surfaces or tree trunks in desert environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant's adaptability to harsh conditions makes it a unique example of desert flora with ornamental and ecological significance."
