    "intro": "Oxalis niveiphylla, commonly known as the snowflake oxalis, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Oxalis niveiphylla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
