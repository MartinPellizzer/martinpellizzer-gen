    "intro": "Ononis spinosiformis var. nyirsegensis, commonly known as the Hungarian spiny rock-cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Carpathian Basin. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with fleshy, spiny stems and small, alternate leaves. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in racemes, and bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. This variety is notable for its unique spiny morphology and ecological adaptability in its native range."
