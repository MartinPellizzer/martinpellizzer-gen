It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces elongated, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Onobrychis virgata has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
