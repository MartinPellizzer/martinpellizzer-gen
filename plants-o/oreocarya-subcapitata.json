    "intro": "Oreocarya subcapitata, commonly known as the Sierra primrose, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Oreocarya subcapitata thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
