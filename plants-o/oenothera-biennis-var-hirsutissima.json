    "intro": "Oenothera biennis var. hirsutissima, commonly known as the woolly evening primrose, is a variant of the evening primrose characterized by its dense, hairy foliage. It is native to North America and thrives in dry, sandy soils, often found in prairies and disturbed areas. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its hairy stems and leaves provide a distinguishing feature from other varieties of Oenothera. This species is also valued for its potential medicinal uses and ornamental value in gardens."
