    "intro": "Ourisia crosbyi, commonly known as Crosby's ourisia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly California. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale yellow. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited range and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
