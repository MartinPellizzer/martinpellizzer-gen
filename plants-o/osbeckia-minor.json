    "intro": "Osbeckia minor, commonly known as the small osbeckia, is a herbaceous annual plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters and features small, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Osbeckia minor is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in open fields, and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insect species."
