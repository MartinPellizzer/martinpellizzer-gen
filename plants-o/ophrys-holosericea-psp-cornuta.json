    "intro": "Ophrys holosericea psp. cornuta, commonly known as the horned bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a specialized labellum that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
