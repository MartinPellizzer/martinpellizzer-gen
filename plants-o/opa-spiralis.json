    "intro": "Opa spiralis, commonly known as the spiral spiraea, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive spiraling growth pattern, where its stems twist around a central axis. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Opa spiralis is native to certain regions of Asia and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value. Its foliage remains lush throughout the growing season, adding visual interest to landscapes."
