    "intro": "Ophrys apifera var. immaculata, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its unique flower structure that closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a dark brown or black marking near the base, mimicking the appearance of a bee. This mimicry attracts male bees, which attempt to mate with the flower, thereby facilitating pollination."
