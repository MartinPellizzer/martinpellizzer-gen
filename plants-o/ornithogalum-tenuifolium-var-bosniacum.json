It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often found in rocky or forested areas, and its growth cycle is influenced by seasonal changes. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
