    "intro": "Opuntia leptocaulis var. robustior, commonly known as the robust prickly pear, is a variant of the opuntia cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are often covered in spiny areoles and clusters of small, globose flowers. The plant produces edible fruits known as tunas, which are typically yellow or orange in color. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The species is well adapted to desert conditions, making it a resilient and hardy plant."
