    "intro": "Orthotropis pungens, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a flowering plant in the family Urticaceae. It is characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant contains fine, stinging hairs that release irritants when touched, causing a painful rash in humans. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed areas. Orthotropis pungens produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, typically in the spring and summer months."
