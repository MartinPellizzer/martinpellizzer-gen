    "intro": "Ophioglossum californicum, commonly known as the California adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the western United States. It features a distinctive, tongue-shaped sterile leaf that is often covered in a dense, woolly layer of fine hairs. The plant produces a single, upright spore-bearing structure called a sporophyll, which is typically shorter than the sterile leaves. Its reproductive cycle is unique, involving the production of spores rather than seeds. Ophioglossum californicum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is considered a relict species with a long evolutionary history."
