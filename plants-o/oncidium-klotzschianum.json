    "intro": "Oncidium klotzschianum, commonly known as the Klotzschian orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features a compact growth habit with a pseudobulb and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white to yellowish hair. The plant produces branched inflorescences with fragrant, showy flowers that come in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often with contrasting patterns. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil with high humidity. Oncidium klotzschianum is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a warm, humid environment."
