It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and branching. Ornithopus isthmocarpus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
