    "intro": "Opuntia leptarthra, commonly known as the narrow-leaved prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, ribbed stems that are covered in sharp spines and small glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia leptarthra is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
