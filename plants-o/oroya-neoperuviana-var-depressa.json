    "intro": "Oroya neoperuviana var. depressa, commonly known as the Peruvian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of Peru. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations ranging from 3,000 to 4,500 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. This variety is closely related to other members of the Boraginaceae family, sharing similar structural and floral features."
