    "intro": "Obione minuscula, commonly known as the tiny obione, is a small flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its diminutive size, often less than 10 centimeters tall, makes it easily overlooked despite its ecological significance. The flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with tiny, scale-like leaves that help it conserve moisture in its habitat."
