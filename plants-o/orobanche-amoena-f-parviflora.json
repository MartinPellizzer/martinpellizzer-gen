    "intro": "Orobanche amoena f. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reduced, often yellowish or greenish, floral structures. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, attaching itself to the roots of various host species such as legumes or grasses. Its small, clustered flowers are usually less than 1 cm in diameter, and it produces small, dry fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact agricultural crops, making it both ecologically and economically significant."
