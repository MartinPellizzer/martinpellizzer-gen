    "intro": "Ophrys molisana, commonly known as the Molise bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking floral morphology, with a labellum that closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow and brown, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects. Ophrys molisana is a rare and protected species, often found in specific microhabitats across the Mediterranean region."
