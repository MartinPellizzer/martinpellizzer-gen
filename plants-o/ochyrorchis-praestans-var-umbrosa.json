    "intro": "Ochyrorchis praestans var. umbrosa, commonly known as the shadow orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and a single, slender flower that typically blooms in late winter or early spring. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish, with a distinctive, hooded structure that protects the reproductive organs. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
