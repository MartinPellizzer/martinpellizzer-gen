    "intro": "Orchis tridentata f. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered twayblade, is a flowering plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features a slender, upright stem with whorled leaves and produces showy, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. This subspecies is distinguished by its larger, more showy flowers compared to the typical form of Orchis tridentata."
