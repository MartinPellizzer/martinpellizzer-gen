    "intro": "Oenothera hazeliae var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered evening primrose, is a species of flowering plant in the Onagraceae family. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are typically upright and branched. This variety is distinguished by its smaller, more compact flowers compared to other members of the Oenothera genus."
