    "intro": "Onobrychis circinnata var. lamprocarpa, commonly known as the golden sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a creeping growth habit and produces small, round pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is valued for soil enrichment and as a forage plant."
