    "intro": "Orobanche stricta, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is a hemiparasite, meaning it can photosynthesize to a limited extent but primarily depends on its host for water and minerals. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found in agricultural fields and disturbed soils. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and can be a problematic weed in crops like wheat and barley. Its life cycle involves germination triggered by chemical signals from host roots, making it a challenge for crop management."
