    "intro": "Orchis mascula, commonly known as the male orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201380 cm, featuring a robust stem with broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single spike of showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive lip that resembles a male genitalia, a feature that has led to its common name. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it thrives in moist, calcareous soils. Orchis mascula is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
