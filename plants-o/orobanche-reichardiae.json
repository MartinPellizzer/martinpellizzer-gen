    "intro": "Orobanche reichardiae, commonly known as the yellow witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and reduced leaves. The plant typically parasitizes members of the Fabaceae family, such as vetches and clovers, by inserting its haustoria into the host's vascular system. Its life cycle involves producing tiny, wind-dispersed seeds that can remain viable in the soil for many years. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
