    "intro": "Opuntia tenuiflora, commonly known as the narrow-flowered prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, edible fruits known as tunas. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Opuntia tenuiflora is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of food in some cultures."
