    "intro": "Ouratea lanceolata var. obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaf ouratea, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Amazon Basin. It features lanceolate, glossy, dark green leaves that are broad at the base and taper toward the tip. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers arranged in panicle clusters, which bloom during the wet season. Its fruit is a spherical capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
