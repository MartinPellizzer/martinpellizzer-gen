    "intro": "Opopanax chironium subsp. bulgaricus, commonly known as the Bulgarian opoponax, is a rare and ancient plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is a member of the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic resinous sap, which has been historically valued for its medicinal and perfumery uses. The plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, exhibiting a slow growth rate and a distinctive, gnarled appearance. Its leaves are alternate and compound, with small, leathery leaflets, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, cone-like fruits. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered endangered and is protected in several countries."
