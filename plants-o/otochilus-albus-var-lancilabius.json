    "intro": "Otochilus albus var. lancilabius, commonly known as the slender white lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive white to pale green thallus. It is characterized by its flattened, leaf-like lobes that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. This variety is typically found growing on shaded, moist rock surfaces in temperate regions. The thallus is usually thin and may vary in texture depending on environmental conditions. It plays a role in soil stabilization and contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
