    "intro": "Oxydectes chaetophora, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic invertebrates. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowers are borne on slender, erect stems. Oxydectes chaetophora is notable for its unique adaptation to nutrient-poor waters, relying on capturing prey to supplement its nutritional needs."
