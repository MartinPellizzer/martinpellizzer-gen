    "intro": "Ornithogalum inandense, commonly known as the African star of Bethlehem, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive drought conditions. Its bulbs are toxic and should not be ingested, though they are sometimes used in traditional medicine. Ornithogalum inandense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance."
