    "intro": "Oncidium gardneri var. pollettianum, commonly known as the Pollett's Oncidium, is a rare orchid species native to specific regions of the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its pendulous, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. It requires well-draining soil and consistent moisture to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
