It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit and produces small, white or pinkish flowers. The leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is distinguished by its striking, variegated foliage that ranges from green to shades of yellow and red. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or limestone areas."
