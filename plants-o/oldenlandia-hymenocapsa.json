    "intro": "Oldenlandia hymenocapsa, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. The plant is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal."
