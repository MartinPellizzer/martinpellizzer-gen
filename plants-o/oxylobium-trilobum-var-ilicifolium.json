It features small, dark green leaves with a leathery texture and a distinctive three-lobed shape. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies and native landscaping."
