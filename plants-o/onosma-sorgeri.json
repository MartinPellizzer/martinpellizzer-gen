    "intro": "Onosma sorgeri, commonly known as the Dorset onosma, is a flowering plant native to the British Isles, particularly found in Dorset and nearby coastal areas. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family, characterized by its hairy stems and blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. It has small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
