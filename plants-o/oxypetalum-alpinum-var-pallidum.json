    "intro": "Oxypetalum alpinum var. pallidum, commonly known as the pale alpine bellflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. Oxypetalum alpinum var. pallidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
