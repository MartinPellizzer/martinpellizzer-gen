    "intro": "Oryctanthus chlamydatus, commonly known as the woolly sandthorn, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its root system is adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. Oryctanthus chlamydatus is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal."
