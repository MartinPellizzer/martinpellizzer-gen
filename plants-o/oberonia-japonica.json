It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a spike, often with a distinctive hood-like structure. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Oberonia japonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate care."
