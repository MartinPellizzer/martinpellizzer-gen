    "intro": "Oriastrum albiflorum, commonly known as the whiteflower muhly, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds that aid in its propagation. Oriastrum albiflorum is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
