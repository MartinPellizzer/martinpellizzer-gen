    "intro": "Orchis palustris var. robusta, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often in bogs or marshes, and is adapted to thrive in waterlogged conditions. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The flowers are usually arranged in a raceme and bloom in late spring to early summer."
