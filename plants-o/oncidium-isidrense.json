    "intro": "Oncidium isidrense, commonly known as the Isidrense orchid, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, producing new shoots from the base of the old ones. The plant features showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange with darker markings, blooming in clusters. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, well-drained environments. Oncidium isidrense is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
