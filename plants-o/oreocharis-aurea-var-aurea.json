    "intro": "Oreocharis aurea var. aurea, commonly known as the golden oreocharis, is a rare flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
