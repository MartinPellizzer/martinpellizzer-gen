    "intro": "Orlaya maritima var. breviaculeata, commonly known as the short-stemmed sea bluet, is a variant of the sea bluet, a flowering plant native to coastal areas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, bluish-green leaves compared to the typical variety. The plant produces small, delicate blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, tolerating salt spray and coastal conditions. This variant is often found in the northern Atlantic coastal regions of North America."
