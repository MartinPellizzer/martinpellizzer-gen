    "intro": "Oncidium festatum, commonly known as the Christmas orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, fragrant flowers that bloom in a raceme, often in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are strap-like, narrow, and often covered in a waxy coating. Oncidium festatum is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its long-lasting blooms and relatively low maintenance requirements."
