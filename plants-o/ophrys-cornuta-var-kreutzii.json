    "intro": "Ophrys cornuta var. kreutzii, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking, bee-mimicking flowers that feature a prominent central projection resembling a male bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange in color, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this variety is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
