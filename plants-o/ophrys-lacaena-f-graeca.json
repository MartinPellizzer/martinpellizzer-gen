    "intro": "Ophrys lacaena f. graeca, commonly known as the Greek bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive lip that resembles a bee's body, attracting male bees for pollination. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
