    "intro": "Odontites jaubertianus var. roseiflorus, commonly known as the pink-flowered toothed bellflower, is a rare and delicate herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family, characterized by its bell-shaped flowers and tubular corollas. The plant features finely toothed leaves and produces clusters of pink to lavender-colored flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
