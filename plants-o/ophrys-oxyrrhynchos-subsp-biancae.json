    "intro": "Ophrys oxyrrhynchos subsp. biancae, commonly known as the Bianca orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a complex lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait used in its intricate pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
