    "intro": "Ochrothallus sessilifolius, commonly known as the sessile-leaf ochrothallus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its woody stems and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its leaves are sessile, meaning they attach directly to the stem without a petiole, and the flowers are usually pink or red, attracting various pollinators."
