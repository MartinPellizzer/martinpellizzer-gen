It is characterized by its upright growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in harsh, dry environments. Oxytropis lasiopoda is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats."
