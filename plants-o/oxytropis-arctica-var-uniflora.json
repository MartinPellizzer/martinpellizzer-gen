    "intro": "Oxytropis arctica var. uniflora, commonly known as Arctic locoweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, branched stems and small, often hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale purple or white, blooming in late summer. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. Oxytropis arctica var. uniflora is an important component of tundra ecosystems, providing forage for certain herbivores."
