    "intro": "Onopordum diacantha, commonly known as the African burr or goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by its woody stems and spiny leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of prickly, spherical fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its adaptive features make it well-suited for harsh environments, and it is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
