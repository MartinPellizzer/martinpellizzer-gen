    "intro": "Opuntia versicolor, commonly known as the rainbow prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, paddle-shaped stems, which are covered in small, sharp spines and glochids. The plant produces vibrant, colorful flowers that range from yellow to red, depending on the season and environmental conditions. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and has a mild, sweet flavor. Opuntia versicolor is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and performing photosynthesis through its flat, fleshy structures."
