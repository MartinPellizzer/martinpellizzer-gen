    "intro": "Onosma echioides subsp. vaudensis, commonly known as the Alpine onion or Vaud onion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers arranged in a loose spike, typical of the genus Onosma. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
