    "intro": "Oncidium egertonii, commonly known as the Lemon-scented Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescences that bear numerous small, fragrant flowers with a yellowish-green to orange hue. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a fan shape, and it thrives in bright, indirect light. Oncidium egertonii is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right growing conditions."
