    "intro": "Oberonia thomsenii, commonly known as the Thomas's orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant has a short, fleshy stem with a single, narrow leaf, and its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and decaying organic matter. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Oberonia thomsenii is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
