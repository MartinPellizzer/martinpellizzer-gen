    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia var. poenalica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and a single, erect flowering stem that produces a cluster of pale pink or greenish flowers. The plant is adapted to grow in shaded, moist woodland habitats, often on calcareous soils. Its flowers are typically pollinated by specific insect species, contributing to its ecological niche. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variant is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
