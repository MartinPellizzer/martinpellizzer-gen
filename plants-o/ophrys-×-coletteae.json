    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 coletteae, commonly known as the Colette's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the genus Ophrys, which is known for its mimicry of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers that are intricately designed to deceive bees into attempting to mate with them, thereby facilitating pollination. The hybrid nature of Ophrys \u00d7 coletteae results from crosses between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera, leading to unique floral characteristics. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
