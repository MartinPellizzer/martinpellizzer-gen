    "intro": "Ocimum medium, commonly known as sweet basil, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of Africa and southern Europe. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are aromatic and often used in cooking and traditional medicine. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or white, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Ocimum medium thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its essential oils, rich in compounds like eugenol and limonene, contribute to its distinct fragrance and various therapeutic properties."
