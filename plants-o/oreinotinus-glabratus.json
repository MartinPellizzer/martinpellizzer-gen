    "intro": "Oreinotinus glabratus, commonly known as the smoothleaf lichen, is a member of the Lecanorales order. It is a saxicolous lichen, typically found growing on rocks in arid or semi-arid environments. The thallus is foliose, with a smooth, leathery surface and a pale green to yellowish color. It lacks distinct lobes and has a uniform texture, which contributes to its common name. This lichen is often used as an indicator species for assessing the health of rocky habitats."
