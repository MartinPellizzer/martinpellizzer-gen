    "intro": "Olfersia lomarioides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Mexico and Central America. It is a lithophytic plant, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, and is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive, intricate pattern resembling a ghostly face. Its flowers are typically pollinated by specific species of bees and moths, contributing to its ecological uniqueness. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Olfersia lomarioides is listed as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
