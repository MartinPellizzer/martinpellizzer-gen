    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 arachnitiformis subsp. mateolana, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate, spider-like appearance, with a dark, hairy labellum that mimics the appearance of an insect. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers are pollinated by male bees, which are deceived into attempting to mate with the flower's petal-like structure. This species is valued for its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat."
