    "intro": "Opuntia castillae, commonly known as the Castille prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, spineless pads and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its succulent stems that store water. Its fruits, known as tunas, are edible and have been used by indigenous peoples for food and medicine. Opuntia castillae plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various desert animals."
