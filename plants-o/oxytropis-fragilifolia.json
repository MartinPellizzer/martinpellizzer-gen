It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, sandy or rocky soils. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are compound, with numerous small leaflets, and the plant is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Oxytropis fragilifolia plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes used in restoration projects."
