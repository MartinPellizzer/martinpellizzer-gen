    "intro": "Orobanche petasites, commonly known as the giant broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish to reddish stems and small, scale-like leaves. This plant typically parasitizes members of the Asteraceae family, such as thistles and dandelions. Its flowers are usually clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences and are pollinated by insects. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants."
