    "intro": "Ottelia ulvifolia subsp. ulvifolia, commonly known as the water lettuce, is a semi-aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has floating leaves that are broad and rounded, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, making it a common aquatic weed. Ottelia ulvifolia subsp. ulvifolia is often found in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes."
