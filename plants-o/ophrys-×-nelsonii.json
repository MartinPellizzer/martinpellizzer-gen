    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 nelsonii, commonly known as the Nelson's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and cool, moist environments. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with dark markings, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Ophrys \u00d7 nelsonii is a rare and protected species, valued for its unique botanical features and ecological significance."
