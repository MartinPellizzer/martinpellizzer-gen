    "intro": "Osmia sinuata, commonly known as the southern masked bee, is a solitary ground-nesting bee species native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Megachilidae and is characterized by its distinctive black and yellow body with a narrow, elongated face. The female constructs its nest in the ground, often in sandy or clay soils, and provisions it with a mixture of pollen and nectar. Osmia sinuata is an important pollinator of various flowering plants, including citrus and other fruit trees. Its behavior and morphology make it a key species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
