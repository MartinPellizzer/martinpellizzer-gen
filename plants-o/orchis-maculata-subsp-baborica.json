    "intro": "Orchis maculata subsp. baborica, commonly known as the Baboric spotted orchid, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive spotted leaves and showy purple or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous grasslands and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. It produces a single spike of flowers, usually with a few to several blooms, and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. This subspecies is of conservation interest due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity."
