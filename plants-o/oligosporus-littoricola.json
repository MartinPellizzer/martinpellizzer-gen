It is primarily found in coastal regions where it plays a role in decomposing organic matter. This species is notable for its ability to produce bioactive compounds with potential pharmaceutical applications. Its unique morphology includes a filamentous structure with specialized spore-forming cells. Oligosporus littoricola contributes to the ecological balance of marine ecosystems by recycling nutrients."
