    "intro": "Oxypappus seemannii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters, featuring a taproot and basal leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that disperse easily by wind. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Oxypappus seemannii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
