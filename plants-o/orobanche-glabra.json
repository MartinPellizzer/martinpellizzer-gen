    "intro": "Orobanche glabra, commonly known as the pale broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats and is often found parasitizing various species of legumes and other herbaceous plants. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots, after which it establishes a connection through specialized structures called haustoria. Due to its parasitic nature, Orobanche glabra can have significant ecological and agricultural impacts on its host plants."
