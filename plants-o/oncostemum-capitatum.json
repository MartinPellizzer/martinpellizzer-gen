    "intro": "Oncostemum capitatum, commonly known as the clustered bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its compact, globular inflorescence that resembles a cluster of small, bladder-like pods. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland regions. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, and the plant is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Oncostemum capitatum plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
