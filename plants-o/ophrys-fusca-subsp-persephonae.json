    "intro": "Ophrys fusca subsp. persephonae, commonly known as the Greek bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils in open, sunny habitats. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing pale yellow to greenish flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
