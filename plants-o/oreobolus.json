These plants are typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Oreobolus species are characterized by their small, often hairy leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers. They are adapted to withstand drought conditions through various physiological mechanisms. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in horticulture for their ornamental value."
