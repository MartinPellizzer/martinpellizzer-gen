    "intro": "Orchis elatior, commonly known as the greater orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces showy, violet or purple flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption. Orchis elatior is often found in meadows, woodland clearings, and other moist, well-drained habitats."
