    "intro": "Oerstedella pansamalae, commonly known as the Panam\u00e1 orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of Panama. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows on tree bark, thriving in the humid, shaded environments of its native habitat. Its botanical features include slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves, which help it adapt to the moist conditions of the canopy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
