It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Oxytropis baissunensis is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
