    "intro": "Oreocarya nubigena, commonly known as the cloud mountain saxifrage, is a rare alpine plant native to the high mountain regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, grayish foliage adapted to cold and arid conditions. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Oreocarya nubigena thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
