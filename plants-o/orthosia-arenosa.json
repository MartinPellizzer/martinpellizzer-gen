    "intro": "Orthosia arenosa, commonly known as the sand larkspur, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Orthosia arenosa is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with low precipitation. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing nectar for pollinators."
