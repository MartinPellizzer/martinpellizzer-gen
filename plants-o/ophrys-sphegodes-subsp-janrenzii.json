    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes subsp. janrenzii, commonly known as the Jan Renz's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, featuring a labellum that closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with a distinctively shaped column and a short, narrow spur. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique evolutionary adaptations."
