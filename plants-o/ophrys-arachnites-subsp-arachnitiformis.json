    "intro": "Ophrys arachnites subsp. arachnitiformis, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a spider, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in open, calcareous habitats, often in grasslands or heathlands. Its flowers are predominantly green with brown and yellow markings, mimicking the appearance of a spider to attract male wasps. This mimicry is an evolutionary adaptation that enhances its reproductive success through deceptive pollination."
