It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through its root nodules, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Onobrychis pinnata is often used in forage and as a cover crop due to its hardy nature and adaptability."
