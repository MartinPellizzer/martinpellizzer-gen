    "intro": "Ophrys spruneri f. micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowers are usually pale yellow with intricate patterns. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
