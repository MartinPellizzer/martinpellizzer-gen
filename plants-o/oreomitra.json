    "intro": "Oreomitra, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a unique composite organism consisting of a fungal partner and a photosynthetic alga. It thrives in harsh, rocky environments where it forms a symbiotic relationship that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor substrates. The structure of Oreomitra is typically crust-like or foliose, with a dense, layered growth pattern that helps it retain moisture. It plays a vital role in soil formation and provides habitat for microorganisms in extreme environments. Due to its specialized adaptations, Oreomitra is often found in high-altitude or arid regions worldwide."
