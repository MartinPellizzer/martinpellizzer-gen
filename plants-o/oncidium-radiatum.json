It features showy, butterfly-like flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with contrasting purple or brown markings. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for epiphytic growth on trees or rocks. Oncidium radiatum requires bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
