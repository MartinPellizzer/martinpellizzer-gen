    "intro": "Opuntia angustata var. comonduensis, commonly known as the Comond\u00fa prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Baja California, Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, spineless stems that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high temperatures and low rainfall. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in local cultures."
