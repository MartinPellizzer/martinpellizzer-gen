    "intro": "Odontochilus, commonly known as the toothed orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand, Malaysia, and the Philippines. They are characterized by their small, delicate flowers that often have a unique, tooth-like appearance on their petals. Odontochilus species typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, thriving on trees or rocks in humid, tropical environments. Their botanical significance lies in their intricate floral structures and their role in local ecosystems."
