It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces umbels of white or pale yellow flowers with showy, violet-black petals. It blooms in late summer to early autumn, and its berries are toxic to humans and animals. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
