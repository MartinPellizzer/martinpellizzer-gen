    "intro": "Orchis mascula subsp. ichnusae, commonly known as the male orchid or the goat's beard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip that is often hairy. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, and it has a fibrous root system. This subspecies is notable for its morphological similarities to other orchid species, making it a subject of taxonomic interest."
