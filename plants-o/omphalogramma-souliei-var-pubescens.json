It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic and often edible plants. The plant is characterized by its finely hairy leaves and small, clustered umbels of white flowers. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a delicate, feathery appearance. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
