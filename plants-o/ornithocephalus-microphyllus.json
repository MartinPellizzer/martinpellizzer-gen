    "intro": "Ornithocephalus microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved bird's head, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and showy, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in its natural range."
