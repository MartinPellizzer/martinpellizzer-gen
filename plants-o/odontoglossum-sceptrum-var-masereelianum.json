It is characterized by its striking, elongated flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, with a distinctive central ridge. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are strap-shaped and often covered in a fine, fuzzy coating. This variety is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements in a suitable growing environment."
