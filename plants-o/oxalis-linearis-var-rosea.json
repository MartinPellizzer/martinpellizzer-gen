    "intro": "Oxalis linearis var. rosea, commonly known as the roseate wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a light green hue and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its foliage resembles that of the common wood sorrel, but the rosea variety is distinguished by its pale pink flowers. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to spread through rhizomes."
