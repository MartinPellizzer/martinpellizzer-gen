    "intro": "Oxylobium, commonly known as the mountain bottlebrush, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian Mountains. The plants are characterized by their striking red or orange flowers, which are clustered in dense, brush-like inflorescences. Oxylobium species typically grow in moist, acidic soils and are often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Their unique floral structure and ecological role make them an important component of their native ecosystems."
