It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and pale green to grayish leaves. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, often with a distinctive hooded lip.

It plays an important role in pollination, attracting various insect species with its nectar-rich blooms."
