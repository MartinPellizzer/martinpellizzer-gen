    "intro": "Orthrosanthus chimboracensis var. centroamericanus, commonly known as the Central American orthrosanthus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its elegant, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
