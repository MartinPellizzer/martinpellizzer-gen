    "intro": "Oncella ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous sea anemone, is a marine cnidarian found in coastal waters of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. It has a distinctive polyp body with a central mouth surrounded by tentacles used for capturing prey. The organism is typically translucent, with a delicate, bell-shaped structure that can contract and expand. It reproduces both sexually and asexually, often through budding. Oncella ambigua plays a role in marine ecosystems by serving as prey for various fish and invertebrates."
