    "intro": "Ophrys apifera var. emanuelae, commonly known as the Emanuel's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a pouch-like structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils with ample sunlight. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
