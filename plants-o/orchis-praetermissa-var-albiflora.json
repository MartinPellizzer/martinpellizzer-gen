    "intro": "Orchis praetermissa var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered common twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a slender, leafless stem that typically grows to a height of about 15-30 cm. The plant produces a single, showy white or pale yellow flower with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and heathlands, often in acidic soils. This variety is notable for its reduced foliage and specialized pollination mechanisms, which are characteristic of many orchid species."
