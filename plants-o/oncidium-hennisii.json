    "intro": "Oncidium hennisii, commonly known as the Hennis orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is a sympodial orchid with a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in varying environmental conditions. The plant produces racemes of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom sequentially throughout the growing season. Oncidium hennisii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
