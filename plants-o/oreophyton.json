    "intro": "Oreophyton, commonly known as the \"mountain plant,\" is an ancient plant species that lived during the Paleozoic era. It is considered one of the earliest known plants with a true root system, distinguishing it from earlier plant forms. Oreophyton typically had a short, upright stem with small, scale-like leaves. Its structure suggests it was adapted to rocky, mountainous environments. Fossilized remains of Oreophyton provide important insights into the evolution of early land plants."
