    "intro": "Orchis mascula var. montisbaetica, commonly known as the Alpine male orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils among rocky substrates, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its morphology reflects adaptations to cold, high-altitude environments, with a short growing season and efficient resource allocation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
