    "intro": "Orthopogon agrostoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf grass or slender grass, is a perennial grass species native to the wetlands and marshy areas of eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, with slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its root system helps stabilize soil in wetland environments, making it ecologically significant. Orthopogon agrostoides is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the biodiversity of these habitats."
