    "intro": "Ononis subocculta, commonly known as the narrowleaf whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland desert environments. Ononis subocculta plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
