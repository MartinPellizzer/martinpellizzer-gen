    "intro": "Oxystophyllum atrorubens, commonly known as the red-black mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of eucalyptus trees in Australia. It has small, leathery leaves that are usually dark green with a reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or black, which are important for seed dispersal by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health of its host trees if left unchecked."
