It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its flat, fleshy pads called cladodes. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which are followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia ruiz-lealii is adapted to arid environments, with spines that help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Its structure and features make it a notable example of desert flora."
