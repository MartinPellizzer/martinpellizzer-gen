    "intro": "Orbignya macropetala, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a large evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, palm-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The tree produces distinctive yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody pods containing the edible seeds known as Brazil nuts. These seeds are encased in a hard shell and are rich in nutrients, particularly selenium and protein. Orbignya macropetala plays a vital ecological role in the rainforest, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
