    "intro": "Ochna holstii, commonly known as the African star, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. Ochna holstii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
