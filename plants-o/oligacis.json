    "intro": "Oligacis, commonly known as the silverleaf plant, is a unique species characterized by its distinctive silvery foliage. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is native to arid and semi-arid regions. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves covered in fine, reflective hairs that give it its characteristic silver appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically in a conical shape, and bloom in shades of yellow or white. Oligacis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
