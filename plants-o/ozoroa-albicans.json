    "intro": "Ozoroa albicans, commonly known as the white-flowered sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or arid regions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Ozoroa albicans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
