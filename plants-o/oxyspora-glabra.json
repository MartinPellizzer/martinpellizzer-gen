    "intro": "Oxyspora glabra, commonly known as the smooth oxyspora, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its smooth, glabrous stem and leaves are distinguishing features, and it is often found in moist, tropical environments. Oxyspora glabra is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role."
