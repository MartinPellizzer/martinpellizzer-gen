    "intro": "Opuntia sphaerocarpa var. utahensis, commonly known as the Utah prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features flattened, ribbed stems that are typically green with a waxy coating, and it produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with spines that provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and contains a sweet, pulpy interior. This variety is notable for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its resilience in harsh desert conditions."
