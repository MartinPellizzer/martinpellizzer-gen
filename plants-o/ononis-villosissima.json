    "intro": "Ononis villosissima, commonly known as the silky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its unique morphology and adaptations make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical studies."
