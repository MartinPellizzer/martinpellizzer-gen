    "intro": "Oxalis polymorpha, commonly known as wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which resemble those of clover, and its delicate yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in woodland areas and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Oxalis polymorpha is a perennial herb that produces small, edible seeds, though the leaves and stems are generally not consumed by humans. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its habitat."
