    "intro": "Olea schimperi, commonly known as the Ethiopian olive, is a small evergreen tree native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically harvested when they are fully ripe. Olea schimperi is adapted to high-altitude environments and has limited commercial cultivation due to its restricted natural range. Its ecological importance in its native habitat is significant, supporting local biodiversity and traditional uses."
