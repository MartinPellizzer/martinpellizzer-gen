    "intro": "Ophrys fusca subsp. blitopertha, commonly known as the Blitoperthian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is known for its low population numbers, making it a subject of conservation interest. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection."
