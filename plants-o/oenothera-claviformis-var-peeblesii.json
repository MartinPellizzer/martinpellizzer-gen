    "intro": "Oenothera claviformis var. peeblesii, commonly known as Peebles' evening primrose, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers typically open in the evening and close by morning, a trait common among evening primroses. Oenothera claviformis var. peeblesii is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and dry slopes."
