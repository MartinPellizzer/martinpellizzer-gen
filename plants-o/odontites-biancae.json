It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense, compact clusters known as scorpioid cymes. Odontites biancae thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often growing in open, sunny habitats. Its foliage and floral structure are adapted to withstand cold temperatures and high-altitude conditions."
