    "intro": "Oxalis renifolia, commonly known as the Kidneyleaf wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, kidney-like leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive reddish or purple coloration. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. Oxalis renifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
