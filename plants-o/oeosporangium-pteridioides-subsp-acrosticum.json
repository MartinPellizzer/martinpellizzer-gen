    "intro": "Oeosporangium pteridioides subsp. acrosticum, commonly known as the acrostic fern, is a rare and delicate fern species characterized by its unique frond structure. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is distinguished by its finely divided, feathery leaves that resemble those of true ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, including sori and sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
