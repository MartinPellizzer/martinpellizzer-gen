    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 sansimonensis, commonly known as the mimic orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe, particularly in regions like France and Italy. The plant is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which closely resembles female wasps, a feature evolved to attract male wasps for pollination. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a unique scent that mimics the pheromones of its pollinators. Ophrys \u00d7 sansimonensis is valued for its ecological role and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental and scientific interest."
