    "intro": "Oxymitra monilifera, commonly known as the bead lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its unique growth form, forming a crustose thallus with a granular appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found on bark or soil in tropical and subtropical regions. Its structure consists of a symbiotic association between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. Oxymitra monilifera plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its native habitats."
