    "intro": "Onobroma arenosum, commonly known as the sand dune globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy and well-drained soils, often found in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and covered in fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. Onobroma arenosum plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and provides nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
