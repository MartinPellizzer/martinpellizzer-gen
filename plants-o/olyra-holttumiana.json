It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible fig-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in dense forests at moderate altitudes. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
