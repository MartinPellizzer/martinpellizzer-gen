    "intro": "Ophioglossum angustatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique leaf structure, which consists of a long, narrow sterile leaf and a shorter, broader fertile leaf that bears spores. Native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions, this plant thrives in rich, well-drained soils. Its sporangia are clustered in a distinctive, tongue-like structure at the base of the fertile leaf. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophioglossum angustatum is often considered a conservation concern."
