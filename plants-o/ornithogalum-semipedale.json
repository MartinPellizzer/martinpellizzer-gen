    "intro": "Ornithogalum semipedale, commonly known as the narrow-leaved star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant is characterized by its underground bulbous structures, which store nutrients and allow it to survive dry periods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Ornithogalum semipedale is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
