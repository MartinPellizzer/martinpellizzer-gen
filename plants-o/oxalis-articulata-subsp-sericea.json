It features trifoliate leaves with a waxy, silky texture, and small, delicate flowers that are typically yellow or orange. The plant grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. It has a creeping rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowers."
