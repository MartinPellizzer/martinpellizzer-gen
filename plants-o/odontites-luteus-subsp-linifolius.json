    "intro": "Odontites luteus subsp. linifolius, commonly known as the yellow rockcress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are typically bright yellow to orange in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in loose clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
