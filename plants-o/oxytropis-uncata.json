    "intro": "Oxytropis uncata, commonly known as the naked locust, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and bipinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. It is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas. Oxytropis uncata is also valued for its role in nitrogen fixation, which enriches the soil."
