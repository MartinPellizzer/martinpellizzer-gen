    "intro": "Otites \u00d7 klopotovii, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Otites arenaria and Otites alpina. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wet meadows and marshes of Central and Eastern Europe. The plant features a slender, often branching stem with whorled leaves and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and purple. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in areas with standing water or high humidity. Due to its unique genetic makeup, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it an interesting subject for botanical study."
