    "intro": "Ophrys fuciflora subsp. scolopax, commonly known as the scolopax orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or open habitats. Its flowers are usually pale green or brown, with intricate patterns that aid in mimicry. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
