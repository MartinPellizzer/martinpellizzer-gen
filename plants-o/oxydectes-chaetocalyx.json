    "intro": "Oxydectes chaetocalyx, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvet tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland forests or along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
