    "intro": "Oryza indandamanica, commonly known as the Indan Delta rice, is a species of wild rice native to the Indan Delta region of India. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in the rainy season. The plant produces elongated, pale yellow grains that are similar in appearance to cultivated rice species. It thrives in wetland habitats and is adapted to seasonal flooding, making it an important component of the local ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
