    "intro": "Ophrys aranifera subsp. macedonica, commonly known as the Macedonian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a bee, a mimicry adaptation that aids in pollination by male bees. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its resemblance to its pollinator. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
