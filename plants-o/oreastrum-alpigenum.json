    "intro": "Oreastrum alpigenum, commonly known as the alpine lousewort, is a flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its parasitic growth habit. The plant typically has small, erect stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its specialized habitat, it is often found in mountainous regions where it plays a role in the alpine ecosystem."
