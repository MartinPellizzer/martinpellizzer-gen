    "intro": "Ononis arborescens var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth tree-campion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems that are typically hairless or nearly so, giving it a smooth appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, though the variety glabrescens is noted for its reduced hairiness. This plant is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
