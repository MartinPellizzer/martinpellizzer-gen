    "intro": "Ochna blanchetiana, commonly known as the African starwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Ochna blanchetiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and flowering display."
