    "intro": "Osmites camphorata, commonly known as the camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, camphor-rich wood, which is highly valued for its medicinal and industrial applications. The tree has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a glossy upper surface. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Osmites camphorata is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its native range."
