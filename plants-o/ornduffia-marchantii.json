    "intro": "Ornduffia marchantii, commonly known as the desert liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its small, thalloid structure that grows close to the ground, typically in arid or semi-arid environments. This plant is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, such as extreme temperatures and limited water availability. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other desert organisms. Ornduffia marchantii is often found in rocky crevices or sand dunes, where it thrives in low-nutrient soils."
