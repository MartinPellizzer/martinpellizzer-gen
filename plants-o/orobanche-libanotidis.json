    "intro": "Orobanche libanotidis, commonly known as the Palestine broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or reddish stem and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, often found in association with leguminous hosts such as Vicia and Astragalus. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by the host roots. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
