    "intro": "Ormiastis pinnata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in the northern hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender, grass-like leaves that are linear and often slightly curved. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are usually greenish or brownish in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in wet environments. Ormiastis pinnata is often found in association with other wetland plants, playing a role in maintaining ecological balance in these habitats."
