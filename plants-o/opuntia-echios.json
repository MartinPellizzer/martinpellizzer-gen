    "intro": "Opuntia echios, commonly known as the red prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are typically green to red in color, covered in glochids and spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red, spherical fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its thick stems to survive in arid environments. Opuntia echios is well adapted to desert conditions and is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value."
