    "intro": "Orchites, commonly known as the \"false orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers that resemble those of true orchids, though they are not closely related. The plants typically have a short, creeping rhizome and produce showy, spike-like inflorescences with numerous small, brightly colored flowers. Orchites species are often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. They play an important role in pollination and are valued for their ornamental appeal in horticulture."
