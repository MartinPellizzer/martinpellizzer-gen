    "intro": "Ophiopogon minor, commonly known as Japanese woodland spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features grass-like leaves that are narrow and slightly curled, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in spike-like clusters during the summer months. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thick mats in suitable conditions."
