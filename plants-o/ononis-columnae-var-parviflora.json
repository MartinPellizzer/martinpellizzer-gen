    "intro": "Ononis columnae var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe. It features slender, hairy stems that often lie prostrate on the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in loose racemes, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. It is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as gravelly slopes and limestone soils."
