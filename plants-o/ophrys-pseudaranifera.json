    "intro": "Ophrys pseudaranifera, commonly known as the false bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with dark markings, and they emit a faint scent to attract pollinators. The orchid is a perennial herb that produces a single, erect stem with a few leaves and a cluster of showy flowers."
