    "intro": "Odontochilus multiflorus, commonly known as the multi-flowered toothed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and features small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
