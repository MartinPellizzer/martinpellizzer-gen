    "intro": "Osmoxylon dinagatense, commonly known as Dinagat balsa, is a rare and endemic tree species found exclusively in the Dinagat Islands of the Philippines. It belongs to the Bombacaceae family and is characterized by its large, buttressed roots and smooth, light-colored bark. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in coastal and lowland rainforest environments. It produces small, pale yellow flowers and elongated, woody fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, Osmoxylon dinagatense is considered critically endangered."
