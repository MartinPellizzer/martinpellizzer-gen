    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 bernardii, commonly known as the Bernard's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is native to southern Europe and is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower structure that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. The species is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its unique pollination strategy and limited distribution."
