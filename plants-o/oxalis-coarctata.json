    "intro": "Oxalis coarctata, commonly known as the narrowleaf wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Oxalis coarctata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
