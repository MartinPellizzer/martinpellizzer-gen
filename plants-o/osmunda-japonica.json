    "intro": "Osmunda japonica, commonly known as Japanese royal fern, is a member of the Osmundaceae family and is characterized by its large, feathery fronds. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant has a distinctive underground rhizome system that supports its growth and helps it spread vegetatively. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in groups. Osmunda japonica is notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a common sight in temperate regions of Asia."
