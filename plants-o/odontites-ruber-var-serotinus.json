    "intro": "Odontites ruber var. serotinus, commonly known as the late-flowering red toothgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. This variety is distinguished from the typical form by its delayed flowering period and distinct coloration of its foliage."
