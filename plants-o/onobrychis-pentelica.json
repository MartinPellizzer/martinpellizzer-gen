    "intro": "Onobrychis pentelica, commonly known as the Greek clover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to arid conditions. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor environments. Onobrychis pentelica is also valued for its role in soil fixation and as a forage plant for livestock."
