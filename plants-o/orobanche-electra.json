    "intro": "Orobanche electra, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that begins with seed germination triggered by chemical signals from host plants. The plant's roots are specialized for attaching to the roots of its hosts, forming a haustorium to extract water and nutrients. It is often found in agricultural fields and disturbed habitats, where it can cause significant damage to crops. Its ecological impact is notable due to its ability to weaken or even kill its host plants."
