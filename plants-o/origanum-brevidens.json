    "intro": "Origanum brevidens, commonly known as dwarf oregano, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, aromatic leaves and clusters of pale blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, contribute to its medicinal and culinary uses. Origanum brevidens is valued for its hardiness and ability to attract beneficial insects to the garden."
