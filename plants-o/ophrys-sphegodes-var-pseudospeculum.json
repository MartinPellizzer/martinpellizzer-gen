    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes var. pseudospeculum, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive flower shape that closely resembles a male bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a dark brown or black lip, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. This orchid is a protected species in many countries due to habitat loss and over-collection."
