    "intro": "Oxalis europaea f. pilosella, commonly known as the hairy wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to its foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is sometimes grown in gardens."
