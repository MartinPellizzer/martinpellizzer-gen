It is a small shrub that typically grows in brackish water environments, such as mangrove swamps and tidal mudflats. The plant has adapted to saline conditions through specialized root systems and salt-excreting leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in green or reddish bracts. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
