    "intro": "Ormenis lonadioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ormenis, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its small, pale blue or purple flowers appear in clusters during the summer months. Ormenis lonadioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
