    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. savannae, commonly known as the savanna rice, is a wild rice species native to the savannas of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, clustered grains. This variety is adapted to thrive in wetland environments with fluctuating water levels. Its genetic diversity contributes to the broader rice genome research. It is less cultivated than other rice varieties but holds ecological and evolutionary significance."
