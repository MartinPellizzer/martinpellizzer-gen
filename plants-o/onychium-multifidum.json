    "intro": "Onychium multifidum, commonly known as the mountain onion or alpine onion, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy bulbs that store nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Onychium multifidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
