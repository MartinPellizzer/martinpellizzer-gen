    "intro": "Oreocharis blepharophylla, commonly known as the starry bellflower, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family, which includes many bell-shaped flowers, and is characterized by its delicate, star-like blossoms that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories, and is adapted to cool, humid climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers feature white petals with a subtle purple hue, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oreocharis blepharophylla is considered a species of conservation concern."
