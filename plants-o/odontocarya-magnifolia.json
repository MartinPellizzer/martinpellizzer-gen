    "intro": "Odontocarya magnifolia, commonly known as the giant fern, is a striking member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its large, lush fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, supporting its extensive root system. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
