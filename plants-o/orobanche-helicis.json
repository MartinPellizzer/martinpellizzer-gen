    "intro": "Orobanche helicis, commonly known as the helix broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various parts of Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle that involves germinating in response to chemical signals from host plants. It is often found growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host species."
