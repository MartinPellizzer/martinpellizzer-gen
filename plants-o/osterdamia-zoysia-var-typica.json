    "intro": "Osterdamia zoysia var. typica, commonly known as the Zoysia grass, is a perennial grass species native to Asia. It is characterized by its fine, dense foliage and a tufted growth habit, making it a popular choice for lawns and ornamental purposes. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves that are typically a bright green color, with a slight bluish tint. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. The grass has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form a dense mat, contributing to its erosion control capabilities."
