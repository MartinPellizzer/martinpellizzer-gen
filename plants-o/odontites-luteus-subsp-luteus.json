It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in sunny to partially shaded environments. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces yellow or orange flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are tubular with two lips, and the plant is known for its ornamental value in gardens. It is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a resilient addition to wildflower gardens."
