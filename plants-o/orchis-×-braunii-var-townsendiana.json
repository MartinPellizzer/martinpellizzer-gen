    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 braunii var. townsendiana, commonly known as Townsend's twayblade, is a hybrid orchid native to the eastern United States. It is a small, herbaceous plant with a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a spike of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers, which are typically arranged in a loose cluster. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swampy areas. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its wetland habitat, with rhizomes that help in nutrient absorption and anchoring."
