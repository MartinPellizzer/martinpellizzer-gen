    "intro": "Orchis elegans var. dinsmorei, commonly known as the Dinsmore's elegant orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its flowers are often adorned with intricate patterns and are pollinated by bees and other insects. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
