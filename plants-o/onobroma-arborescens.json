    "intro": "Onobroma arborescens, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Onobroma arborescens is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in harsh desert conditions."
