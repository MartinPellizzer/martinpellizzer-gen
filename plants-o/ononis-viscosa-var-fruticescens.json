It features slender, branched stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread extensively. The leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. Small, yellowish-white flowers appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. This plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
