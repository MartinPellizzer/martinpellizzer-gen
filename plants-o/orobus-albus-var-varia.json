    "intro": "Orobus albus var. varia, commonly known as the white orchid of the south, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its pale white petals and intricate floral structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives on nutrient-poor soil. Its flowers bloom during the late spring to early summer, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
