    "intro": "Ophrys umbilicata var. bucephala, commonly known as the Bucephalus bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive pouch-like structure called a labellum, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
