    "intro": "Oncidium pohlianum, commonly known as the Pohlian's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, strap-like leaves and clusters of fragrant, yellow-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, and it requires well-draining potting media. Oncidium pohlianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
