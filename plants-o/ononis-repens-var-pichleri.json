    "intro": "Ononis repens var. pichleri, commonly known as creeping eryngo, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and hairy, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by slender, cylindrical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows. Its medicinal properties have been historically noted, though it is generally considered a weed in agricultural settings."
