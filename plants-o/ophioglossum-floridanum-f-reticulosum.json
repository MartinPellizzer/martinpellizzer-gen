    "intro": "Ophioglossum floridanum f. reticulosum, commonly known as the Florida adder's tongue, is a rare fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, spurred spore-producing structures called sporangia, which are distinctly shaped and positioned on the leaf. The plant has a short, stout rhizome and produces a single, elongated, lance-shaped leaf with a prominent, tooth-like projection at the base. Its spores are released in a specialized, elongated structure called a sporangium, which is covered in a network of fine, reticulate patterns. This variant is distinguished by its intricate reticulation on the sporangium, which gives it its specific epithet \"reticulosum.\""
