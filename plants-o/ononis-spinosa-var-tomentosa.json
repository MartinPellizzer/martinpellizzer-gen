    "intro": "Ononis spinosa var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a rounded or pointed tip, and the plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas, along paths, and in disturbed habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in herbal remedies."
