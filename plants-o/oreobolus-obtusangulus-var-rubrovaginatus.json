    "intro": "Oreobolus obtusangulus var. rubrovaginatus, commonly known as the red-stemmed swamp grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Australia. It is characterized by its clustered growth habit and distinctive, narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves and stems often exhibit a reddish hue, particularly along the margins, which is a key identifying feature. This variety is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils and is an important component of wetland ecosystems."
