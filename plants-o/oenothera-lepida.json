    "intro": "Oenothera lepida, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and prairies. Oenothera lepida plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
