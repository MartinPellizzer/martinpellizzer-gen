It is characterized by its flat, paddle-like stems that resemble cucumbers, covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which are followed by edible, fleshy fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to hot, dry climates. Opuntia cucumiformis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in local cultures."
