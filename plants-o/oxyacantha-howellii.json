It is characterized by its narrow, spindly growth habit and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in winter, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Oxyacantha howellii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
