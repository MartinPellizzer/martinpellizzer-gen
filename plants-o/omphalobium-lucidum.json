It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with oval, glossy green leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy, pod-like structures that mature in late summer. Omphalobium lucidum is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands."
