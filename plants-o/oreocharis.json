    "intro": "Oreocharis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique member of the orchid family. It is characterized by its delicate, white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on the bark of trees in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, allowing it to thrive in epiphytic conditions. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, many species of Oreocharis are now critically endangered."
