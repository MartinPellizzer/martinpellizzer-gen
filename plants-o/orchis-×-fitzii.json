    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 fitzii, commonly known as the Fitz's orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis anthropophora. It is a terrestrial herbaceous plant with a robust rhizome and a single, erect stem that bears a cluster of showy, violet-blue flowers. The flowers are typically arranged in a spike and have a distinctive lip that is often marked with darker pigments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows, and it is native to parts of Europe. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a natural hybrid and its ornamental value in horticulture."
