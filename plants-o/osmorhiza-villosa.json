    "intro": "Osmorhiza villosa, commonly known as hairy cow-wheat, is a flowering plant native to western North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its fern-like leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive appearance, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring. Osmorhiza villosa is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability."
