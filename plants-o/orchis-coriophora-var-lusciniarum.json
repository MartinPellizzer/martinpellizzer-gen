    "intro": "Orchis coriophora var. lusciniarum, commonly known as the Lusciniarum Orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
