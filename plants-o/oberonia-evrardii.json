    "intro": "Oberonia evrardii, commonly known as the Malagasy orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a complex column and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in montane forests, where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and ecological role within its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited propagation, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
