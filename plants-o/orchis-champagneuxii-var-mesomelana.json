    "intro": "Orchis champagneuxii var. mesomelana, commonly known as the Champagne orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking, often purple or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats, favoring rich, humus-filled soils. Its flowers are usually borne in loose clusters and have a distinct, intricate structure typical of orchids. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
