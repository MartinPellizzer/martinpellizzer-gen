    "intro": "Onobrychis sativa var. pseudosupina, commonly known as false sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces cylindrical, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. False sainfoin is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration and sustainable agriculture."
