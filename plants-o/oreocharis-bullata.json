    "intro": "Oreocharis bullata, commonly known as the Bullate Orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. Native to China, it is characterized by its unique, colorful flowers that resemble small, delicate orchids. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, preferring cool and moist environments. Its leaves are usually dark green and lance-shaped, while its flowers display a mix of white, pink, and purple hues. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oreocharis bullata is considered a species of conservation concern."
