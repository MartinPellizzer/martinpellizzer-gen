    "intro": "Orchis latifolia var. macrobracteata, commonly known as the broad-leaf orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking, spurred orchid flowers in shades of purple and pink. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is known for its ornamental value in gardens. The variety macrobracteata is distinguished by its larger bracts compared to the typical form of Orchis latifolia."
