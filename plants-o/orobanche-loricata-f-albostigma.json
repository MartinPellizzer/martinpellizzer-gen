    "intro": "Orobanche loricata f. albostigma, commonly known as the white-stigma holoparasite, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing members of the Fabaceae family. The plant is characterized by its reduced foliage and specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from white to pink. This form is distinguished by its pale stigma, which gives it its specific epithet."
