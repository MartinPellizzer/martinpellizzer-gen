    "intro": "Orbexilum chiapasanum, commonly known as the Chiapas orbexilum, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of southern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its unique, orb-shaped inflorescence. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically ovate with a hairy surface, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
