    "intro": "Opuntia fulgida, commonly known as the golden prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and are often brightly colored. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which bloom in the spring and are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Opuntia fulgida is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system. It plays an important role in its ecosystem, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
