    "intro": "Onosma paradoxa, commonly known as the paradoxical sandthistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, yellowish to greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Onosma paradoxa is often found in open habitats such as coastal dunes and disturbed soils."
