    "intro": "Onobrychis cornuta f. jesdiana, commonly known as the Jesdian thorned vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, thorned stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
