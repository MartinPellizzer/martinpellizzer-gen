    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 jeanpertii, commonly known as the Jeanpert's orchid, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis pallidula. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe, particularly in the Mediterranean region. The plant produces tall flowering stems that bear showy, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive hooded structure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant. The botanical features of Orchis \u00d7 jeanpertii make it a notable example of natural hybridization in the Orchidaceae family."
