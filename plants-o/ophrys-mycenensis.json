    "intro": "Ophrys mycenensis, commonly known as the Mycenae Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature known as pseudocopulation. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow and brown, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by male bees. Ophrys mycenensis is known for its short flowering period, typically in spring, and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
