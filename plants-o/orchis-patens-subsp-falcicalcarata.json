    "intro": "Orchis patens subsp. falcicalcarata, commonly known as the bent-crested orchid, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features a tall, unbranched stem with several whorled leaves, and its flowers are usually pink or purple with a prominent lip. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. The subspecies is distinguished by its curved, falcate (sickle-shaped) callus on the column, a key identifying feature in orchid taxonomy."
