    "intro": "Ophioglossum ramosii, commonly known as the adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its unique, sword-shaped leaves that are typically green with a reddish or brownish midrib. The plant produces sporangia on specialized, tongue-like structures that give it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
