It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces umbels of white, star-shaped flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The genus Ornithogalum is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique floral display."
