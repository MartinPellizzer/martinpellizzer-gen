    "intro": "Onobrychis grossheimii, commonly known as the yellow burclover, is a perennial legume native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. Onobrychis grossheimii is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment."
