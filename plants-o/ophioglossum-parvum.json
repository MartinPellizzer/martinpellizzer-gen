    "intro": "Ophioglossum parvum, commonly known as the small adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a fleshy, creeping rhizome and a single, erect, tongue-shaped leaf. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaf, which are clustered in a structure called a sorus. Ophioglossum parvum is typically found in moist, shaded habitats, often in woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
