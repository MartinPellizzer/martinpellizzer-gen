It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture, contributing to its common name. Odontoglossum velleum is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
