    "intro": "Orchis maculata var. foliis-immaculatis, commonly known as the white helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking white to pale green flowers with a distinctive greenish-brown lip. The plant typically grows in woodland habitats, thriving in shaded, moist environments with rich, well-drained soil. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and often lack the dark spots found in the typical variety of Orchis maculata. This variant is notable for its lack of the characteristic dark markings on the leaves, giving it a more uniform appearance."
