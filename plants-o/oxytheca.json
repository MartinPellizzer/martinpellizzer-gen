    "intro": "Oxytheca, commonly known as the \"crown of thorns,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its unique, spiny calyx that surrounds the flower, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically simple and opposite, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The flowers are usually showy, with five petals and prominent stamens, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Oxytheca species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas."
