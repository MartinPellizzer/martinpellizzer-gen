    "intro": "Ononis spinosa var. antiquorum, commonly known as the ancient sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with numerous branching stems that root at the nodes. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or rocky habitats."
