    "intro": "Odontophyllum porphyrocarpum, commonly known as the purple-fruited orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, violet-colored fruits that remain on the plant for an extended period. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
