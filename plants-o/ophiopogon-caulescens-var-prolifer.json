    "intro": "Ophiopogon caulescens var. prolifer, commonly known as the clustered lilyturf, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense clumps. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
