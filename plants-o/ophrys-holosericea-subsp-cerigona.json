    "intro": "Ophrys holosericea subsp. cerigona, commonly known as the Cerignola bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in specific habitats such as rocky slopes and open woodlands. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
