    "intro": "Oxalis cinerea, commonly known as ghost plant or silverweed, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery or pale green coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring or early summer. Oxalis cinerea thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
