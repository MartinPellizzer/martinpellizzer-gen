    "intro": "Oxygraphis involucrata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Oxygraphis involucrata is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types make it an invasive species in some areas."
