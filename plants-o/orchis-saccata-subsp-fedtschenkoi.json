    "intro": "Orchis saccata subsp. fedtschenkoi, commonly known as the Fedtschenko's spurred orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive spurred petals and a unique floral structure that facilitates specific pollination mechanisms. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its morphology includes a slender stem with a single, showy flower that blooms in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
