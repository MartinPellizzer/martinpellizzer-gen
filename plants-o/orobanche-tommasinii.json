    "intro": "Orobanche tommasinii, commonly known as the Italian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, showy flowers that range from white to purple. This species typically parasitizes members of the Fabaceae family, such as vetches and clovers, by inserting its haustoria into the host's vascular system. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of suitable host plants, making it an important component of certain ecosystems. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host species."
