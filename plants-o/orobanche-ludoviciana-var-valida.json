    "intro": "Orobanche ludoviciana var. valida, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow, thread-like stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically parasitizes various species of legumes and other herbaceous plants, forming a haustorium to absorb water and nutrients. It is native to North America and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants."
