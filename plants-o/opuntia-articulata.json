    "intro": "Opuntia articulata, commonly known as the jointed prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, segmented stems that are covered in spiny areoles and clusters of small, glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, fleshy fruits called tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system that allows it to survive in arid environments. Opuntia articulata is well adapted to drought and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food."
