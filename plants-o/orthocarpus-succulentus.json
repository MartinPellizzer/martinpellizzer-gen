    "intro": "Orthocarpus succulentus, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are often branching and can grow up to several feet in height. Orthocarpus succulentus is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
