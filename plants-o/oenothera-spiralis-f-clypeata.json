    "intro": "Oenothera spiralis f. clypeata, commonly known as the cup-shaped evening primrose, is a variant of the evening primrose species native to North America. It is characterized by its unique, cup-like floral structure that resembles a shallow bowl, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that open in the evening and close by dawn. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas. The leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
