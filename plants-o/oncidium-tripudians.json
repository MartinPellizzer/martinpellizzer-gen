    "intro": "Oncidium tripudians, commonly known as the dancing lady orchid, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its elegant, pendulous flowers that resemble a dancer in motion, hence its common name. The plant has strap-like leaves and produces fragrant, yellowish-green blooms with intricate patterns. Oncidium tripudians is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
