It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its foliage is generally narrow and grass-like, with leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating.
