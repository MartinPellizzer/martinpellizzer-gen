It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain both male and female flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Oryzopsis virescens is also valued for its use in erosion control and as a forage crop in some regions."
