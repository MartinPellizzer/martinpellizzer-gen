    "intro": "Oreophysa, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique, often showy flowers that are adapted to grow in rocky or mountainous environments. Oreophysa species typically have tall, slender stems with narrow leaves and are found in temperate to subtropical regions. The flowers are usually small to medium in size, with a distinctive structure that includes a labellum, which is specialized for attracting pollinators. Due to their specific habitat requirements, many Oreophysa species are rare and face threats from habitat loss and environmental changes."
