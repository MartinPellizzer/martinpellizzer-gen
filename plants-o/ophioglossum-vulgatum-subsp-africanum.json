    "intro": "Ophioglossum vulgatum subsp. africanum, commonly known as the African adder's tongue, is a fern-like plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, tongue-shaped spore-producing structure called a sporophyll. The plant has a short, stout rhizome and produces two to three pairs of lance-shaped, glossy leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
