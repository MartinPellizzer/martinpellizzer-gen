    "intro": "Oxytropis jordalii, commonly known as Jordan's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in poor soil conditions. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Oxytropis jordalii is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats."
