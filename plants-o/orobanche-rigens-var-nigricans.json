    "intro": "Orobanche rigens var. nigricans, commonly known as the blackroot broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark-colored stems and small, scale-like leaves. This species typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in association with leguminous plants. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth of its host plants."
