    "intro": "Oenothera lasiocarpa, commonly known as the rough-hairy evening primrose, is a species of flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Oenothera lasiocarpa is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its potential medicinal properties."
