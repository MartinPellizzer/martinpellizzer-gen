    "intro": "Oreocarya commixta, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in dry conditions, and its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like. Oreocarya commixta is adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. Its botanical features make it an important part of the local flora and an attractive plant for xeriscaping."
