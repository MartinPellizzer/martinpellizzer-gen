    "intro": "Othonna hederifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf groundsel, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features a compact, mat-forming growth habit with thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are arranged in a basal rosette, and the stems are often branched and slightly hairy. Othonna hederifolia is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
