    "intro": "Onobrychis sirinae, commonly known as the Sirinae burr clover, is a flowering plant native to parts of the Middle East and Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is well adapted to arid environments. It produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Onobrychis sirinae is often found in grasslands and rocky areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
