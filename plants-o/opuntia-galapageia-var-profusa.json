    "intro": "Opuntia galapageia var. profusa, commonly known as the Galapagos prickly pear, is a cactus native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant produces edible fruits known as tunas, which are often consumed by both humans and wildlife. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The species is also notable for its role in the local ecosystem, providing food and shelter for various native animals."
