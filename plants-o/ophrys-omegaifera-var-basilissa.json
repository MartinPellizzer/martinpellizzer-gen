    "intro": "Ophrys omegaifera var. basilissa, commonly known as the Basilissa bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral structure, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant features a single, showy flower with a distinctive, hooded labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees. It thrives in rocky or limestone soils and requires specific microclimatic conditions for successful growth. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
