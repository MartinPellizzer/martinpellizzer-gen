    "intro": "Oxyanthus speciosus var. glaber, commonly known as the smooth oxyanthus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and clusters of small, showy yellow flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a smooth, waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. This variant is distinguished from other oxyanthus species by its reduced pubescence and specific floral morphology. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded undergrowth in humid forests."
