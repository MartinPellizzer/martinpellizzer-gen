    "intro": "Ornithidium elianae, commonly known as the Eleana's ornithidium, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of South America, particularly in regions of Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming structure with thick, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in its humid habitat. Its flowers, which are typically small and inconspicuous, are borne in terminal inflorescences. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, Ornithidium elianae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
