    "intro": "Odontanthera boveana, commonly known as the Boveana grass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, cylindrical flower clusters. Odontanthera boveana is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
