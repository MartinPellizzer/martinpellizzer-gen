    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 maremmae subsp. woodii, commonly known as the Maremma orchid, is a rare hybrid orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the genus Ophrys, which is known for its mimicry of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant produces intricate, bee-mimicking flowers that are often adorned with dark markings and a specialized lip structure. It typically grows in calcareous soils and requires specific microclimatic conditions for successful germination and growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
