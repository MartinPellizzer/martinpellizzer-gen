    "intro": "Ophrys lucentina, commonly known as the Lucentina bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Ophrys lucentina is a short-lived perennial, producing a single spike of flowers each year before dying."
