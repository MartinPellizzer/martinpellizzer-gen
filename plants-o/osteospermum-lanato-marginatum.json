    "intro": "Osteospermum lanato-marginatum, commonly known as the woolly osteospermum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant features showy yellow-centered flower heads surrounded by white to pale blue ray florets. Its leaves are hairy and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Osteospermum lanato-marginatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
