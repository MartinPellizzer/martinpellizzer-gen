    "intro": "Oporinia autumnalis, commonly known as the autumn fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that emerge in the fall. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Oporinia autumnalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
