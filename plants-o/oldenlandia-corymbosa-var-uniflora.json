    "intro": "Oldenlandia corymbosa var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower mistletoe, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it attaches to host trees and derives some of its nutrients from them while also performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in corymbs, giving it its scientific name. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The fruit is a small capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can remain viable for several years."
