    "intro": "Onopordum beckianum, commonly known as Beck's thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and large, purple to pinkish-blue composite flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a rough, sometimes woolly texture. Beck's thistle plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
