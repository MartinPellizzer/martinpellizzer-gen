    "intro": "Oxytropis lhasaensis, commonly known as the Lhasa oxytropis, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to the harsh, cold climate of its native habitat. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine environments and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme conditions."
