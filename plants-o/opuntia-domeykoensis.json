    "intro": "Opuntia domeykoensis, commonly known as the Domeyko prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Andean regions of Chile and Argentina. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and are typically green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick stems to survive drought conditions. Opuntia domeykoensis is also valued for its edible fruits and has cultural significance in the regions where it is found."
