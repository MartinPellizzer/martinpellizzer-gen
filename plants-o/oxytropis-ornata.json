    "intro": "Oxytropis ornata, commonly known as the showy milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and open woodlands. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep taproot system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Oxytropis ornata is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
