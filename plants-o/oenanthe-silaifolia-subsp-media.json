It typically grows in moist, rocky or alpine environments, often found in meadows and streambanks at high elevations. The plant features slender stems with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are small, white or greenish-white, and arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
