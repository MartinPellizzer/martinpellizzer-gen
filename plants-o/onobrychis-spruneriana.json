    "intro": "Onobrychis spruneriana, commonly known as the spruner's vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to tolerate drought conditions. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
