    "intro": "Oxydectes linearis, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense spike, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Oxydectes linearis is typically found in moist soils along the edges of ponds, lakes, and wet meadows. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat."
