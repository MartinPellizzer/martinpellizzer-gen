    "intro": "Oliverella, commonly known as the \"false olive,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Oleaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. The plants are characterized by opposite, simple leaves and small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or white. Oliverella species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and their ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils. They are also valued for their historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
