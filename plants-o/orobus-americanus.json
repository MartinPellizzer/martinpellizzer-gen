    "intro": "Orobus americanus, commonly known as the American milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, attracting various pollinators. Its latex sap is milky and contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals. Orobus americanus plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing a host plant for their larvae."
