    "intro": "Onobrychis borysthenica, commonly known as the Crimean sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in steppe and grassland habitats. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is used in agricultural systems for soil enrichment and forage."
