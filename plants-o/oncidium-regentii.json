    "intro": "Oncidium regentii, commonly known as the regent orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting inflorescence that features a cluster of fragrant, colorful flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, well-drained environments. Oncidium regentii is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
