    "intro": "Oxossia pernambucensis, commonly known as the Pernambuco lily, is a tropical flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces a fleshy, bulb-like structure that stores nutrients and water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Oxossia pernambucensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
