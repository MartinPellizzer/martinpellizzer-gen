It is characterized by its smaller stature and reduced flower size compared to the typical species. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers that open in the evening. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in prairie and disturbed habitats. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in native plant gardens."
