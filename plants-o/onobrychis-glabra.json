It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Velvet brome is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
