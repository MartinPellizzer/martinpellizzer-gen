It is characterized by its flattened, pad-like stems that are typically green and covered in spines. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and has a mild, sweet flavor. Opuntia nemoralis is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
