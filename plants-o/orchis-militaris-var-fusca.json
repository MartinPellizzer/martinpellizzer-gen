    "intro": "Orchis militaris var. fusca, commonly known as the black helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, hooded flowers that are typically purple or black in color. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and heathlands. It has a complex root system and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees, and the plant is known for its longevity, often living for several decades."
