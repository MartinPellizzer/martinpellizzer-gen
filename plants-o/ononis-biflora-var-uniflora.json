    "intro": "Ononis biflora var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flowered whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to rocky and coastal areas of the northern hemisphere. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a single, showy white or pink flower per stem, which blooms in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in disturbed or coastal habitats. Its medicinal properties have historically been used in traditional herbal remedies for skin conditions."
