    "intro": "Oligochaetochilus pratensis, commonly known as the marsh hound, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to wetlands and marshy areas in Southeast Asia. It typically grows in dense clusters, with slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a single lip, which are often borne on short, erect spikes. It is adapted to moist, nutrient-poor soils and thrives in environments with high humidity. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
