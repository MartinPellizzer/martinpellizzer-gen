    "intro": "Onobrychis arenaria f. kurdistanica, commonly known as the Kurdish sand clover, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the mountainous regions of Kurdistan. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its legume-like pods and nitrogen-fixing ability, which contributes to soil enrichment. The plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, showcasing adaptations to harsh climatic conditions. Its small, pea-like flowers are usually pink or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat destruction and climate change."
