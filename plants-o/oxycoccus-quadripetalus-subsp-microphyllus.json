    "intro": "Oxycoccus quadripetalus subsp. microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved crowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, fleshy, dark red berries that are typically edible and rich in vitamin C. The plant has compact, leathery leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length, adapted to harsh environmental conditions. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. The species plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and stabilizing soil in extreme environments."
