    "intro": "Orostachys latielliptica, commonly known as the broad-elliptic orach, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically lanceolate or elliptic in shape, adapted to store water. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. Orostachys latielliptica is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
