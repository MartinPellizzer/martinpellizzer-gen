    "intro": "Orchis praetermissa var. pulchella, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland and meadow habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves and a single, erect flowering stem. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
