    "intro": "Oncidium sceptrum, commonly known as the sword orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features long, sword-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, white, and orange. Oncidium sceptrum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
