    "intro": "Ophrys plakotiana, commonly known as the Greek bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting male bees for pollination. Ophrys plakotiana is a protected species in several countries due to habitat loss and over-collection."
