    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. vulgaris, commonly known as rice, is a grass species native to Asia and is one of the most important staple foods worldwide. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stalks and small, clustered flowers that develop into grains. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 1.5 meters and thrives in wet, tropical, or subtropical climates. Its reproductive structure includes spikelets with three bracts, each containing a single floret. The grain, or seed, is enclosed in a husk and is rich in carbohydrates, making it a vital source of nutrition."
