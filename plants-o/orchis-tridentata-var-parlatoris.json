    "intro": "Orchis tridentata var. parlatoris, commonly known as the parlator's twayblade, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe. It is a small, herbaceous plant with a distinctive appearance, featuring a single, narrow leaf and a spike of pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common feature among orchids, and is adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments. Its flowers are typically pollinated by specific insect species, contributing to its ecological niche. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, this variant is considered endangered in many regions."
