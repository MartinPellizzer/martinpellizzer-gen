    "intro": "Ophrys fuciflora var. maxima, commonly known as the giant bee orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that mimic the appearance of female bees, a feature known as sexual deception. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous habitats, often in woodland or heathland environments. Its flowers have a distinctive yellow-green color with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by male bees. This variant is notable for its robust size and is found primarily in the Mediterranean region."
