    "intro": "Ophrys holosericea subsp. vanbruggeniana, commonly known as the Van Bruggen's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
