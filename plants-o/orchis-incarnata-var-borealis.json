    "intro": "Orchis incarnata var. borealis, commonly known as the northern fairy orchid, is a rare and delicate species native to the northern regions of North America. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as bogs and wet meadows, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees, and the plant produces small, dark brown capsules as its fruit. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered endangered in many areas."
