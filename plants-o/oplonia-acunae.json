    "intro": "Oplonia acunae, commonly known as the Andean sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Oplonia acunae is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional Andean medicine."
