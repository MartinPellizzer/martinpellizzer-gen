    "intro": "Oryza meyeriana, commonly known as Meyer's rice, is a species of grass native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Poaceae family and is closely related to cultivated rice species. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and produces small, spikelet-like flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Oryza meyeriana is often found in wetland habitats and is of interest to botanists due to its genetic relationship to rice."
