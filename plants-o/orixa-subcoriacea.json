    "intro": "Orixa subcoriacea, commonly known as the rough-stemmed orixa, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Orixa subcoriacea is often found in shaded, moist habitats such as forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies."
