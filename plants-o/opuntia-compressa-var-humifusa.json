    "intro": "Opuntia compressa var. humifusa, commonly known as the low flat prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features flattened, fleshy stems that lie close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Opuntia compressa var. humifusa is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
