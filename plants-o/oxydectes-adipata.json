    "intro": "Oxydectes adipata, commonly known as the fat-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its often arid or seasonally dry habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in a loose inflorescence. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the soil, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky substrates. Oxydectes adipata is often found in shaded, humid environments within cloud forests or forest understories."
