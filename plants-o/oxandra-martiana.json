    "intro": "Oxandra martiana, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain smooth, black seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in the making of musical instruments. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
