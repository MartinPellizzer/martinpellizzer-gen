    "intro": "Oxytheca parishii subsp. abramsii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, woody stems and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is part of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants."
