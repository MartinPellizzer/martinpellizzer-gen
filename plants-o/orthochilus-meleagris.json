    "intro": "Orthochilus meleagris, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and delicate, spotted leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, with a distinct lip petal. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges or grassy areas. Orthochilus meleagris is a protected species in many regions due to its declining populations and ecological significance."
