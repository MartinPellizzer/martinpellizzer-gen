    "intro": "Opuntia tunicata var. laevior, commonly known as the smooth-tunicated prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, paddle-shaped stems covered in a thick, waxy coating that provides protection against drought and intense sunlight. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are modified into spiny structures called glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. This species is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
