    "intro": "Onoclea spicata, commonly known as the field horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its segmented, jointed stems and a distinctive spore-bearing structure called a strobilus. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true leaves and roots. Onoclea spicata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
