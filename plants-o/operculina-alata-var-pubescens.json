It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds, and is characterized by its vine-like growth habit. The plant features palmately lobed leaves and produces yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, inflated fruits. Its hairy texture, as suggested by the variety name, is a notable botanical feature, contributing to its unique appearance."
