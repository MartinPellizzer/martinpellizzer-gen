These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Ochna species are typically small to medium-sized trees or shrubs, characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, often yellow or orange flowers. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and some species have medicinal uses in traditional medicine. The genus is noted for its ornamental value and ecological importance in native habitats."
