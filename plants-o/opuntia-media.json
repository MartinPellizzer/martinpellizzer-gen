    "intro": "Opuntia media, commonly known as the flat prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers in the spring, followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Opuntia media is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and performing photosynthesis through its green skin. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert animals."
