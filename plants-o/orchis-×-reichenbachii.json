    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 reichenbachii, commonly known as the Reichenbach's orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis mascula. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing intricate, lip-shaped petals that are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects. Its roots are fibrous and often form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in moist, shaded woodland environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
