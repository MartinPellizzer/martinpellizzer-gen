    "intro": "Odontochilus kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu toothed orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green, adapted to the cool and humid conditions of its mountainous habitat. The plant has a short, erect stem with few leaves, and its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the rich, mossy substrates of the forest floor. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is highly valued for its unique morphology and ecological significance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and habitat loss."
