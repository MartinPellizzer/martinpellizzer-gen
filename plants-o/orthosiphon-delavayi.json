    "intro": "Orthosiphon delavayi, commonly known as the Chinese nettle or Delavay's horse tail, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Orthosiphon delavayi is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
