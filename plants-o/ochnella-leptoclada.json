    "intro": "Ochnella leptoclada, commonly known as the slender-leaved ochna, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Ochnaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
