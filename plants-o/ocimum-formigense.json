    "intro": "Ocimum formigense, commonly known as the ant plant, is a species of flowering plant in the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its small, fragrant leaves and clustered purple flowers. The plant is notable for its unique relationship with ants, which live in the hollow stems and provide protection in exchange for honeydew. Its aromatic properties make it useful in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb. Ocimum formigense thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
