It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, showy flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color. The plant produces small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Its flowers are borne on short, erect spikes and are known for their unique, spurred structure. Ornithidium bracteatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a warm, humid environment."
