    "intro": "Oryza prehensilis, commonly known as the climbing rice plant, is a species of grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with specialized tendrils that allow it to ascend supports. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture. Oryza prehensilis is primarily of interest in botanical studies due to its unique climbing structure and potential genetic relationships to other rice species."
