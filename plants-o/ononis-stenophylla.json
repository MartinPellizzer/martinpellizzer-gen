    "intro": "Ononis stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leafed sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in loose, nutrient-poor soils. Ononis stenophylla is adapted to withstand drought and is often used in ecological restoration projects in dry environments."
