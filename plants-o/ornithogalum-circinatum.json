    "intro": "Ornithogalum circinatum, commonly known as the spiral lily, is a bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features a tall, unbranched stem with narrow, grass-like leaves that spiral around the stem, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of white or pale green, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in summer. Its bulbs are toxic and contain calcium oxalate crystals, which can cause irritation if ingested. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
