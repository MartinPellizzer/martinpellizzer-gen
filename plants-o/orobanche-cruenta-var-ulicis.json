    "intro": "Orobanche cruenta var. ulicis, commonly known as the common yellow witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found growing on the roots of leguminous plants such as vetch and alfalfa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth patterns of its host, with germination triggered by chemical signals from the host's roots. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops, making it a concern for farmers."
