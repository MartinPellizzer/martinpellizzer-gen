    "intro": "Oliganthes milleri, commonly known as the Miller's oliganthes, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows as a small shrub, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters, with narrow, gray-green leaves covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing in clusters and blooming during the warmer months. Oliganthes milleri is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it access groundwater."
