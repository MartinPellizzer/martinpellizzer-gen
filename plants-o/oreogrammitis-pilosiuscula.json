    "intro": "Oreogrammitis pilosiuscula, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. This fern typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Oreogrammitis pilosiuscula is often found in high humidity areas and is adapted to thrive in microhabitats with consistent moisture."
