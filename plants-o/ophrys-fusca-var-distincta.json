    "intro": "Ophrys fusca var. distincta, commonly known as the distinct lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a pouch-like labellum that mimics female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually broad and grass-like, while its flowers are predominantly brown or reddish in color. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, this variant is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
