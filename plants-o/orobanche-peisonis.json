    "intro": "Orobanche peisonis, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its roots are specialized to attach to the roots of host plants, such as those in the legume family. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and productivity of its host plants."
