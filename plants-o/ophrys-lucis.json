    "intro": "Ophrys lucis, commonly known as the moon orchid, is a rare and fascinating orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a specialized lip that mimics the appearance of a female insect to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in cool, humid climates. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, Ophrys lucis is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
