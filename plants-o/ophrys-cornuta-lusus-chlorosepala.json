    "intro": "Ophrys cornuta lusus chlorosepala, commonly known as the chlorosepala bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, elongated flower spike with a single, highly ornate flower that exhibits a striking combination of green and brown hues. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
