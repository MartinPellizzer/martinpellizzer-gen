    "intro": "Oenothera ammophiloides, commonly known as sea blite, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of North America. It is a member of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers that open in the evening. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, tolerating salt spray and harsh coastal conditions. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and branching. Oenothera ammophiloides plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
