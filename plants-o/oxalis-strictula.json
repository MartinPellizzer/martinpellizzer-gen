    "intro": "Oxalis strictula, commonly known as the narrowleaf wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its botanical characteristics include hairy stems and a basal rosette of leaves, which help it conserve water in arid conditions. Oxalis strictula is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
