    "intro": "Orobanche versicolor, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often growing on crops like wheat and barley. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves germinating in response to chemical signals from its host. Its roots are specialized for attaching to the roots of host plants, forming a haustorium to extract water and nutrients. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant yield losses in agricultural crops."
