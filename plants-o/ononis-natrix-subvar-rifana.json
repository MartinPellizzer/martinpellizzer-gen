It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are small, trifoliate, and hairy, while its stems are slender and often prostrate. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its arid habitats and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
