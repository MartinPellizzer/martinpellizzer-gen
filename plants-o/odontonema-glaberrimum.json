    "intro": "Odontonema glaberrimum, commonly known as the velvetleaf stinging nettle, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves contain irritant chemicals similar to those found in stinging nettle. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Odontonema glaberrimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some indigenous communities."
