    "intro": "Onobrychis argentea subsp. hispanica, commonly known as Spanish velvet bean, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with silver-white markings and small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces elongated, hairy pods containing edible seeds that are rich in protein. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. Its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability make it both a horticultural and ecological interest."
