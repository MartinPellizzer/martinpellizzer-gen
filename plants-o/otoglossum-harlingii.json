    "intro": "Otoglossum harlingii, commonly known as the Harling's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with a pseudobulb and produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by insects. Due to habitat loss, Otoglossum harlingii is considered rare and is often protected in its native range."
