    "intro": "Oncidium sanguineum var. roseum, commonly known as the Roseum Oncidium, is a hybrid orchid prized for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms. It features showy, rose-pink to red flowers that are highly fragrant and often appear in clusters. The plant is native to tropical regions of South America and thrives in warm, humid environments. It has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in less-than-ideal conditions. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
