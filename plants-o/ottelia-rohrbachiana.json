    "intro": "Ottelia rohrbachiana, commonly known as the water buttercup, is a semi-aquatic plant native to parts of Africa. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, with its leaves floating on the surface or submerged underwater. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom above the water, often in clusters. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the aquatic environment. Ottelia rohrbachiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
