    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza remotiflora, commonly known as the slender sandalwood or narrow-leaved sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is often found in sandy or muddy soils. Its fruit is a small capsule that releases tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Ophiorrhiza remotiflora is also valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of incense."
