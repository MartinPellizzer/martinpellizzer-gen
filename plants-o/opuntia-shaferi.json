    "intro": "Opuntia shaferi, commonly known as the Shafer's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia shaferi is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It plays an important role in local ecosystems and has been used by indigenous peoples for food, medicine, and fiber."
