    "intro": "Oreobolus goeppingeri var. tuquerrensis, commonly known as the Tuquerren sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America, particularly found in the Andean regions of Colombia and Ecuador. It typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, preferring saturated soils and full sun to partial shade. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with tiny, greenish-white flowers. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in high-altitude environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its range."
