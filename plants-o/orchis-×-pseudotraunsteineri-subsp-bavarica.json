    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 pseudotraunsteineri subsp. bavarica, commonly known as the Bavarian twayblade, is a hybrid orchid species native to Central Europe. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of grass-like leaves and produces a single, slender flowering stem. The flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a distinctive purple or brown lip, and they bloom in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is often found in moist, calcareous grasslands and woodland edges. Its botanical characteristics reflect its hybrid origin, combining traits from its parent species, Orchis morio and Orchis purpurea."
