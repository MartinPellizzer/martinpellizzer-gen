    "intro": "Onobrychis afghanica subsp. codringtonii, commonly known as Afghan sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor conditions. This subspecies is valued for its forage quality and potential in ecological restoration projects."
