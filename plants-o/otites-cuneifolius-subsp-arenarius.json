    "intro": "Otites cuneifolius subsp. arenarius, commonly known as the sand otite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in loose clusters, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
