    "intro": "Okoubaka, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a deciduous tree native to the savannas of sub-Saharan Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thick, milky sap, which is toxic and used in traditional medicine. The tree has a straight trunk with a smooth, greyish-brown bark and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and oval-shaped, and it is often found in dry, open habitats. The okoubaka is valued for its hard wood and has been used by local communities for various purposes, including construction and crafts."
