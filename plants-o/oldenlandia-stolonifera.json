    "intro": "Oldenlandia stolonifera, commonly known as Asiatic spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and covered with fine hairs. The stolons, or runners, allow it to spread and form dense mats, making it both a ornamental and sometimes invasive species."
