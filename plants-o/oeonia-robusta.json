    "intro": "Oeonia robusta, commonly known as the robust ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet, with lance-shaped leaves and showy purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its robust stem and hairy foliage are adaptations to its woodland and wetland habitats. Oeonia robusta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for pollinators."
