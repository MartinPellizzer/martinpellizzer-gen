It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring silver-gray, woolly leaves that are deeply lobed. The plant produces purple to pink composite flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense, spherical heads. Its stems are spiny and often branched, contributing to its defensive characteristics.
