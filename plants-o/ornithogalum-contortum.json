    "intro": "Ornithogalum contortum, commonly known as the twisted star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, rhizomatous stem with narrow, linear leaves that are often twisted, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Ornithogalum contortum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
