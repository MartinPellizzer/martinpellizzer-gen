    "intro": "Orobanche caerulea var. millefolii, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has no true roots and instead attaches to its host via haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It typically parasitizes plants in the Brassicaceae family, such as mustard and cabbage. Due to its lack of leaves and photosynthetic ability, it is often found growing in close association with its host in disturbed or agricultural soils."
