    "intro": "Orobanche mutelii var. interjecta, commonly known as the Indian broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish-orange stems and small, scale-like leaves. This species typically parasitizes a variety of host plants, including those in the Fabaceae and Asteraceae families. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often appearing in shades of yellow and orange. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in certain ecosystems, though it can be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
