    "intro": "Osmia atriplicifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf mason bee, is a solitary bee species native to North America. It is characterized by its dark, metallic blue body and is often found pollinating plants in the Apiaceae family. The female constructs small, mud-based nests in hollow stems or pre-existing cavities. Osmia atriplicifolia plays an important role in pollination, particularly for crops like carrots and celery. Its life cycle is closely tied to the flowering periods of its host plants."
