    "intro": "Operculicarya, commonly known as the \"flowering shrub\" or \"ornamental shrub,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. These plants are characterized by their evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Operculicarya species typically grow in woodland or rocky habitats and prefer well-drained, acidic soils. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments. The genus includes several species, such as Operculicarya corymbosa, which is prized for its clusters of fragrant white flowers."
