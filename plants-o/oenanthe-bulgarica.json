    "intro": "Oenanthe bulgarica, commonly known as Bulgarian hemlock, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and delicate umbellate flowers. It is native to the Balkan Peninsula and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and can become invasive in certain regions, making it a plant of ecological interest and caution. The species is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine."
