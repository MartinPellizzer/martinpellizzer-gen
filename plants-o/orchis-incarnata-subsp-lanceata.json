    "intro": "Orchis incarnata subsp. lanceata, commonly known as the lance-leaf fairy orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, loamy soils. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces striking, violet-blue flowers in late spring. Its morphology is adapted to its woodland habitat, with a rhizomatous root system that aids in nutrient absorption. The species is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting local pollinators."
