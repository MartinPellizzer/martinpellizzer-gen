    "intro": "Oxalis debilis var. corymbosa, commonly known as the miniature wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that resemble small clover leaves, with each leaflet having a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental appeal and compact size, it is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
