    "intro": "Oberonia macrostachys, commonly known as the large-stemmed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, leafy stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its roots are fibrous and often form dense networks in the soil. This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
