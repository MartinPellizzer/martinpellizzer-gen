    "intro": "Ophiopogon humilis, commonly known as the Japanese forest grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to East Asia. It features dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, dark green leaves that form a dense mat. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal. Ophiopogon humilis is also valued for its ability to suppress weeds and improve soil stability in forested areas."
