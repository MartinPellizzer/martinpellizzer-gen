    "intro": "Oxyacantha amygdalifolia, commonly known as the almond-leaved spindletree, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, spiny stems and small, ovate leaves with a glossy, dark green surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a decorative hedge. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its contrasting foliage and seasonal blooms."
