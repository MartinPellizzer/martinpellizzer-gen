    "intro": "Odonia viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered odonia, is a rare flowering plant native to the temperate rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking emerald-green petals and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are known to contain bioactive compounds, making it of interest to botanists and herbalists. Due to habitat loss, Odonia viridiflora is currently listed as an endangered species."
