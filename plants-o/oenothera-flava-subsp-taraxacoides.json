    "intro": "Oenothera flava subsp. taraxacoides, commonly known as the yellow evening primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features showy yellow flowers that open in the evening, a characteristic shared with other species in the Oenothera genus. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and produces capsule fruits containing numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a food source for nocturnal pollinators and its potential medicinal uses."
