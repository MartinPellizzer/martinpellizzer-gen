    "intro": "Oryzopsis tibetica, commonly known as Tibetan ricegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to three florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. Oryzopsis tibetica plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is of interest for its potential in ecological restoration projects."
