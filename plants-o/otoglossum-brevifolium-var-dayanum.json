    "intro": "Otoglossum brevifolium var. dayanum, commonly known as the Dayanum orchid, is a rare and elegant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, fragrant flowers. The plant typically features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered blooms in shades of white and pale yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
