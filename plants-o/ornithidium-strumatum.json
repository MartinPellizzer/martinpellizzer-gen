    "intro": "Ornithidium strumatum, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying alpine flora. Conservation efforts are ongoing due to its vulnerability to habitat loss and climate change."
