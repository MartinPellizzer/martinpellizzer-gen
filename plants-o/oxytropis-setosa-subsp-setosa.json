    "intro": "Oxytropis setosa subsp. setosa, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its small, erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
