    "intro": "Odontarrhena markgrafii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its dark reddish-brown bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, fleshy fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth.
