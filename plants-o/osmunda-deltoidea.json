    "intro": "Osmunda deltoidea, commonly known as the shuttlecock fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, triangular fronds. It is native to eastern North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a creeping underground stem that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are typically divided into segments with a unique, shuttlecock-like shape, giving it its common name. Osmunda deltoidea plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small vertebrates."
