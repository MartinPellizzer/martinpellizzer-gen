    "intro": "Orobanche grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its showy, often pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and is found in regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It has a complex life cycle that involves forming specialized structures called haustoria to attach to the roots of its host. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological systems and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
