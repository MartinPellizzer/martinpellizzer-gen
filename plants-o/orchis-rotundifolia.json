    "intro": "Orchis rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaved orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its rounded, broad leaves and tall, slender flowering stems that bear clusters of violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. It has a complex root system and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Orchis rotundifolia is an important component of diverse ecosystems and is often found in conservation areas due to its habitat specificity."
