    "intro": "Olea decussata, commonly known as the cross-leaved olive, is a shrub or small tree native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its opposite, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Olea decussata is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
