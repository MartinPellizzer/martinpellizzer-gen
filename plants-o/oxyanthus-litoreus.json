    "intro": "Oxyanthus litoreus, commonly known as the coastal oxyanthus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Oxyanthus litoreus plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small coastal organisms."
