    "intro": "Ophrys cornuta var. phrygia, commonly known as the Phrygian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a male bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract specific pollinators. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its pollinator mimicry. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
