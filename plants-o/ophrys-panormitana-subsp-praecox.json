    "intro": "Ophrys panormitana subsp. praecox, commonly known as the early orchid of Pantelleria, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the volcanic island of Pantelleria in Italy. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a complex lip and column typical of the Orchidaceae family. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, calcareous soils and is adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat. Its flowering period occurs early in the growing season, usually between March and May. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species with conservation concerns."
