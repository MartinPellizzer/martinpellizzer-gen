It is characterized by its showy yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The species is part of the Onagraceae family and is known for its ability to survive in extreme conditions with minimal water."
