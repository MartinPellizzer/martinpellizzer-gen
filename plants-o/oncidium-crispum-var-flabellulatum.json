    "intro": "Oncidium crispum var. flabellulatum, commonly known as the Flabellum Oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant has strap-like leaves that are often folded or crinkled, giving it a unique appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This orchid is popular among growers for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
