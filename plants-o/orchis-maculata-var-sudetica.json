    "intro": "Orchis maculata var. sudetica, commonly known as the Sudetic spotted orchid, is a rare and protected species native to Central Europe. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, calcareous grasslands and meadows. The plant features a tall, slender stem with a single, showy violet-blue flower that has a distinctive dark purple or brownish blotch on the lower lip. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
