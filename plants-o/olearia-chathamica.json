    "intro": "Olearia chathamica, commonly known as the Chatham Island daisy, is a flowering plant native to the Chatham Islands of New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in dense, daisy-like clusters. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the harsh maritime climate of its native habitat. Olearia chathamica has narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is considered a rare and endemic species, with limited distribution and specific ecological requirements."
