    "intro": "Oncidium hastilabium, commonly known as the showy oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red, often with contrasting patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture from the air. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Oncidium hastilabium is prized for its long-lasting blooms and is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
