    "intro": "Ossea, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and spiny, leaf-like bracts that surround the flower cluster. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and along the seashore. Ossea has a compact growth habit and is often used in ornamental gardening for its unique appearance. Its botanical name, Eryngium maritimum, reflects its maritime habitat and distinctive foliage."
