    "intro": "Opuntia brachyacantha, commonly known as the short-armed prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers, typically in late spring or early summer, followed by edible fruits that are commonly consumed. Opuntia brachyacantha is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
