    "intro": "Opulus glandulosa var. globosa, commonly known as the globular elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early summer. The plant produces small, dark purple berries in the fall, which are edible but often used in culinary and medicinal applications. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have serrated edges, while its stems are covered in glandular dots. This species is often found in moist woodland areas and thrives in partial to full shade."
