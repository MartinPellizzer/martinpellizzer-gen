    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza jingxiensis, commonly known as the Jingxi mangrove, is a rare shrub endemic to the tropical rainforests of southern China. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed or secondary forest areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
