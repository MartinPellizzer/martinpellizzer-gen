    "intro": "Orobanche cannabis, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It attaches itself to the roots of host plants, such as those in the sunflower family, to extract nutrients and water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly reduced structure compared to typical flowering plants. It is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
