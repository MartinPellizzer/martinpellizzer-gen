    "intro": "Oncidium barbatum, commonly known as the beard orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, hairy roots and its striking, often fragrant flowers that come in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its flowers are borne on racemes and can last for several weeks, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Oncidium barbatum requires bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
