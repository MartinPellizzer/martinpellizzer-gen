    "intro": "Ononis basiadnata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Ononis basiadnata is typically found in rocky soils and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
