It is characterized by its small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating. It thrives in shallow water and is adapted to nutrient-poor environments. Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
