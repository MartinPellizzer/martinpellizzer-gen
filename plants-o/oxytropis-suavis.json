    "intro": "Oxytropis suavis, commonly known as sweet lupin, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine environments. Oxytropis suavis is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil in its native habitat."
