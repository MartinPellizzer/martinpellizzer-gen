    "intro": "Orchis farreri, commonly known as the Farri\u2019s orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of pale pink to purple flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers have a distinctive spurred lip that aids in pollination. Orchis farreri prefers moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and grassy slopes. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often protected in its native range."
