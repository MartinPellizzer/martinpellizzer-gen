It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature vibrant colors such as purple, pink, and white. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without being parasitic. Its pseudobulbs are short and thick, supporting its foliage and flowering structures. Odontoglossum \u00d7 adrianae requires specific care, including high humidity, bright indirect light, and well-draining potting media to thrive."
