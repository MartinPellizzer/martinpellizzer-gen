It features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, often brightly colored flowers that resemble tiger stripes. Its foliage consists of long, strap-like leaves that are typically dark green. Oncidium pardothyrsus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements."
