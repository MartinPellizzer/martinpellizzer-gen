    "intro": "Ornithogalum toxicarium, commonly known as the toxic milk lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its strap-like, gray-green leaves and showy, star-shaped white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic, containing calcium oxalate crystals, which can cause irritation upon contact. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in controlled environments."
