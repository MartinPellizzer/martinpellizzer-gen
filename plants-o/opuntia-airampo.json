    "intro": "Opuntia airampo, commonly known as the Airampo prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed hairs that can cause irritation. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible. Opuntia airampo is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick stems. It plays a role in local ecosystems and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
