The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the winter months, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. It has a compact growth habit and is often grown as an ornamental plant in rock gardens. Othonna rhopalophylla thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping."
