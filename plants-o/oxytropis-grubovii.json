    "intro": "Oxytropis grubovii, commonly known as the Grubov's locoweed, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically range in color from white to pale purple. The plant has a deep root system that enables it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are often trifoliate, and the plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility. Oxytropis grubovii is also noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens."
