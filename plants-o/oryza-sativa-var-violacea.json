    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. violacea, commonly known as the purple rice, is a variety of rice characterized by its distinctive violet or purple grain color. This coloration is due to the high concentration of anthocyanin pigments, which are naturally occurring antioxidants. It is native to Southeast Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its nutritional benefits. The plant typically grows in flooded rice paddies, similar to other rice varieties, and has a short growth cycle. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for both culinary and horticultural purposes."
