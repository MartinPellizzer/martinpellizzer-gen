    "intro": "Oreogrammitis coredrosora, commonly known as the rock fern, is a member of the Pteridaceae family and is characterized by its unique morphology and habitat preferences. It typically grows on rocky substrates, where it forms dense, compact clusters that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with a dense network of roots that anchor it to the substrate and absorb nutrients. Its fronds are usually narrowly lanceolate, with a waxy surface that reduces water loss. Oreogrammitis coredrosora is often found in mountainous regions, where it thrives in cool, shaded conditions with high humidity."
