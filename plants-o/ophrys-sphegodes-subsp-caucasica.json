    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes subsp. caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a bee, a feature evolved to attract specific pollinators. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
