    "intro": "Ohigginsia refulgens f. smaragdina, commonly known as the Emerald Glow Cactus, is a unique variant of the Ohigginsia refulgens species. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that are typically a vibrant green color, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. It is native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Chile, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. This cactus is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in dry gardens and rockeries."
