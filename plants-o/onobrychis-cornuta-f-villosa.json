    "intro": "Onobrychis cornuta f. villosa, commonly known as the hairy goat's rue, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy, spiny pods and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. This variety is notable for its hirsute foliage and its role in traditional herbal medicine."
