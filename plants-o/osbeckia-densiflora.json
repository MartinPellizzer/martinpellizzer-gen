It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and streambanks. The plant features alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a rough, textured surface. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, and are usually pink to reddish in color. Osbeckia densiflora is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
