    "intro": "Osmunda claytoniana var. vera, commonly known as the Eastern royal fern, is a deciduous fern characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. It features a distinctive, slender, unbranched sterile frond that is typically shorter than the fertile fronds, which bear spore-producing structures called sori. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands, stream banks, and forest floors, where it forms dense colonies. Its rhizome system is robust, allowing it to spread vegetatively and establish itself in suitable habitats. The spores are released from the sori, which are covered by a protective indusium, facilitating reproduction in humid conditions."
