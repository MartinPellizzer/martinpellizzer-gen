    "intro": "Obione angularis, commonly known as the angular spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, angular stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a shallow root system and is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its leaves are typically fleshy and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Obione angularis is often found in rocky soils and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance."
