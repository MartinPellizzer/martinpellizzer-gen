It is characterized by its striking yellow and white flowers, which resemble small blossoms, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. This variety is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its vibrant color and elegant appearance."
