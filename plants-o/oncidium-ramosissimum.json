    "intro": "Oncidium ramosissimum, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its branched inflorescence and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with prominent white lips. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding environment, and it thrives in warm, humid conditions with indirect sunlight. Oncidium ramosissimum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its long-lasting blooms."
