It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland areas across Europe. It produces a single spike of flowers, each with a three-lobed lip that is often marked with darker veins. Orchis \u00d7 chabalensis is an important species for studying hybridization in orchids and ecological adaptation."
