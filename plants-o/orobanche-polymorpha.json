    "intro": "Orobanche polymorpha, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, often yellow or greenish flowers and has a distinctive, tuberous root system. It parasitizes a wide range of host plants, including legumes and grasses, and can significantly impact agricultural crops. Due to its lack of photosynthesis, it plays a unique role in ecological systems as a hemiparasite."
