    "intro": "Olea cuspidata, commonly known as the sharp-pointed olive, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often adorned with small, sharp spines at the base. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by edible, black drupes that are similar in appearance to olives. Olea cuspidata thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
