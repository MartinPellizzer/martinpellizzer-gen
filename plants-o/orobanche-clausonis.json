    "intro": "Orobanche clausonis, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly reduced structure, with no true leaves or stems. It typically parasitizes plants in the legume family, such as vetches and clovers. Due to its lack of photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its habitat."
