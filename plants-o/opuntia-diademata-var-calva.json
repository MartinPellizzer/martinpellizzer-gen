    "intro": "Opuntia diademata var. calva, commonly known as the naked prickly pear, is a cacti species native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its reduced spines and flat, paddle-shaped stems known as cladodes. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. The plant is often used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some regions."
