    "intro": "Oenothera macrosiphon, commonly known as the large-horned evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Oenothera macrosiphon is a member of the Onagraceae family, which includes other species like the common evening primrose. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments."
