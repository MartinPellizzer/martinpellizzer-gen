    "intro": "Osbeckia maritima, commonly known as sea oxeye, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is often found in maritime climates. Osbeckia maritima is a low-growing perennial that plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and strong winds makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
