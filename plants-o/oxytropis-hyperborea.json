    "intro": "Oxytropis hyperborea, commonly known as the Arctic locoweed, is a perennial shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor environments and often grows in tundra and alpine habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
