    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes subsp. majellensis, commonly known as the honey orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive flower structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that aids in its unique pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow and brown, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its specialized ecological requirements and limited distribution."
