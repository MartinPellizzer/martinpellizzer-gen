    "intro": "Orobanche aemula, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and has a taproot system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is often found parasitizing crops such as wheat, barley, and legumes, making it a significant agricultural pest. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays an important role in ecosystem dynamics and can influence the health of its host plants."
