    "intro": "Opuntia miquelii, commonly known as the Miquel's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems known as cladodes, which are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations such as reduced leaf surface and water-storing tissues. Opuntia miquelii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in local cultures."
