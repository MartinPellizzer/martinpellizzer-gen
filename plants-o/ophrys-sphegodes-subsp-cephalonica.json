    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes subsp. cephalonica, commonly known as the Greek bee orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It is characterized by its specialized flowers that closely resemble female bees, a feature known as pseudocopulation, which aids in pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are greenish-yellow with intricate patterns. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
