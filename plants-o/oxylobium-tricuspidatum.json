    "intro": "Oxylobium tricuspidatum, commonly known as the three-toothed oxylobium, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, which are typically borne on the stems. Its root system is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, which is a common trait among legumes, aiding in soil fertility. Oxylobium tricuspidatum is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
