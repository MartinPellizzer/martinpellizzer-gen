    "intro": "Ophrys umbilicata var. calycadniensis, commonly known as the Wimmera Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of an insect, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils within open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. It is a perennial herb with a short, rhizomatous stem and produces small, pale green to brownish flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
