    "intro": "Oberonia acaulis var. luchunensis, commonly known as the Luchun slender orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to Yunnan Province in China. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with prominent, showy lips. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, typically in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
