    "intro": "Onoclea nodulosa, commonly known as the nodular water clover, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It is characterized by its small, rounded, floating leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and colonize wetlands. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in early summer. Onoclea nodulosa plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
