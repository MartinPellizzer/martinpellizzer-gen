    "intro": "Odontoglossum foliosum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Odontoglossum foliosum is often cultivated for its beauty and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
