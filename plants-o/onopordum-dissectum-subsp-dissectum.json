It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are deeply dissected, giving the plant a fern-like appearance. It is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats."
