    "intro": "Oxytropis borealis var. australis, commonly known as the northern bur pea, is a perennial legume native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Oxytropis borealis var. australis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environments and is an important food source for certain pollinators."
