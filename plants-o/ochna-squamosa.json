    "intro": "Ochna squamosa, commonly known as the African snowball, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of white flowers that resemble snowballs, which bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has elliptical, glossy leaves that are opposite in arrangement and often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with a distinctive flaky texture. Ochna squamosa is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its striking appearance."
