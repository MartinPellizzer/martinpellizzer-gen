    "intro": "Ophioglossum gramineum var. majus, commonly known as the giant adder's tongue fern, is a distinctive fern species characterized by its elongated, sword-shaped fronds. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae and is native to parts of Asia, particularly China and Japan. The plant features a unique sporangium structure that is prominent and located at the base of the frond, aiding in its identification. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
