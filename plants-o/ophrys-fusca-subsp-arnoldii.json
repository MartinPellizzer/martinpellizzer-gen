    "intro": "Ophrys fusca subsp. arnoldii, commonly known as the Arnold's bee orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait known as sexual deception. The plant produces a single, showy flower that is typically greenish-yellow with dark markings, designed to attract male bees for pollination. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
