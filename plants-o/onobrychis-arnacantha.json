    "intro": "Onobrychis arnacantha, commonly known as the Arnacantha burr clover, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by spiny, pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
