    "intro": "Onobrychis gracilis f. inermis, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in raceme clusters, which are followed by small, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability. This variety is distinguished by its lack of stipules, giving it a unique appearance compared to other members of the species."
