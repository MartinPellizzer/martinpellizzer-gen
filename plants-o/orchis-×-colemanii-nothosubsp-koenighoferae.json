It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet to purple flowers with a distinct lip. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. It is native to the Alps and has been observed in various regions of Europe. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variability."
