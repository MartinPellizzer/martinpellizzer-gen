    "intro": "Orobanche galii-molluginis, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It parasitizes a wide range of host plants, including legumes and grasses, by inserting its haustoria into the host's vascular system. Due to its lack of photosynthesis, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem as a specialized parasite."
