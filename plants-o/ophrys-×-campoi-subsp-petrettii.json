    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 campoi subsp. petrettii, commonly known as the Petretti's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower structure, which features a vivid yellow face with dark markings resembling a bee's face. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are highly specialized, designed to mimic the appearance of female bees to attract male bees for pollination. This species is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role."
