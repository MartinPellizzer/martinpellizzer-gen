    "intro": "Ophrys cornuta var. akcakarae, commonly known as the Akcakara horned orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Turkey. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a prominent, horn-like spur that serves as a pollination mechanism. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in mountainous regions. Its flowers are usually pale green or brown, with intricate patterns that mimic female insects to attract male pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
