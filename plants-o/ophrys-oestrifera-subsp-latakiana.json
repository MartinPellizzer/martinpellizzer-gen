    "intro": "Ophrys oestrifera subsp. latakiana, commonly known as the Latakian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive labellum that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
