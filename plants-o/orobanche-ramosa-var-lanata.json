    "intro": "Orobanche ramosa var. lanata, commonly known as the woolly broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, pale yellow to white flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, and its stems are covered with soft, lanate (woolly) hairs. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas where it can parasitize a variety of host plants. Its life cycle depends entirely on the presence of compatible host species, and it is considered a weed in some regions. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant yield losses in crops."
