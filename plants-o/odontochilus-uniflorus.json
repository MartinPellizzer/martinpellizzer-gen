    "intro": "Odontochilus uniflorus, commonly known as the single-flowered toothed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, tooth-like structures on the leaf margins, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces a single, small, pale green or white flower that blooms during the wet season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
