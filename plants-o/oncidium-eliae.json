    "intro": "Oncidium eliae, commonly known as the Yellow Butterfly Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers with intricate patterns that resemble butterfly wings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to survive in drier conditions. Oncidium eliae thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
