    "intro": "Oxypetalum capitatum subsp. angustum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved oxypetalum, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered inflorescences that produce showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink. The leaves are narrow and lanceolate, often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. This subspecies is adapted to cool, moist environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant for alpine gardens and rockeries."
