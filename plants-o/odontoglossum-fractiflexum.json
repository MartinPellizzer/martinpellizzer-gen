    "intro": "Odontoglossum fractiflexum, commonly known as the flexile orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit and produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant features showy, fragrant flowers with a unique, spurred lip that aids in pollination by specific insects. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Odontoglossum fractiflexum is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements in cultivation."
