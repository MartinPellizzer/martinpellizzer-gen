    "intro": "Ottelia muricata, commonly known as the spiked water plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving rivers. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often covered in small, spiny projections, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, floating on the water surface or submerged beneath it. Ottelia muricata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water oxygenation."
