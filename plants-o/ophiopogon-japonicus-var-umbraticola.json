    "intro": "Ophiopogon japonicus var. umbraticola, commonly known as the shade-loving lilyturf, is a perennial plant native to East Asia. It features dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, dark green leaves that form a low, mat-like growth. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds. This variety is particularly adapted to woodland settings and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
