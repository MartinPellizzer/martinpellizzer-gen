    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 orphanidesii, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Orchis morio and Orchis anthropophora. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats across Europe. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it is often found in association with other orchid species. This hybrid is of interest to botanists due to its genetic diversity and ecological significance."
