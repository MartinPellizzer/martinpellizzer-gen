    "intro": "Ophrys apifera subsp. immaculata, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201340 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, showy flower per stem. Its flowers are greenish-yellow with a dark brown or black stripe running down the center, resembling a bee's body. This subspecies is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism and is often found in sunny, well-drained soils in meadows and grasslands."
