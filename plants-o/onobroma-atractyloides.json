It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling candles, hence its common name. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The leaves are palmately lobed, and the plant is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
