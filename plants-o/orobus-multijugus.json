    "intro": "Orobus multijugus, commonly known as the many-juged orobus, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is native to parts of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often resembling those of other legumes. Its leaves are compound, typically with several pairs of leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Orobus multijugus is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique floral structure and adaptability to arid conditions."
