    "intro": "Odontocarya froesii, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit tree, is a flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, edible fruits that resemble starfruits, though they are not related to the common starfruit (Carambola). Its foliage consists of lance-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Odontocarya froesii is valued for both its ornamental beauty and its potential medicinal properties."
