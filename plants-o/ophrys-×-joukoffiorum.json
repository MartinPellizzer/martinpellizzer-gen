    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 joukoffiorum, commonly known as the Joukoff's bee orchid, is a hybrid species within the genus Ophrys, known for its intricate mimicry of female wasps. This plant is characterized by its striking, bee-like flowers that feature a prominent lip resembling a wasp's body. It typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in Mediterranean climates, particularly in southern Europe. The plant is a perennial herb with a rhizomatous root system and produces showy, pseudobulb-like structures. Its pollination strategy relies on sexual deception, attracting male wasps that attempt to mate with the flower."
