    "intro": "Ottelia somalensis, commonly known as the Somali water plant, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Somalia. It belongs to the family Nychthemeraliaceae and is characterized by its floating leaves and long, slender stems. The plant typically grows in shallow water bodies and is adapted to fluctuating water levels. Its leaves are usually broad and rounded, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Ottelia somalensis plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
