    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. praecox, commonly known as early rice, is a variety of rice that matures quickly, typically within 100 to 120 days. It is characterized by its short stature and compact growth habit, which makes it suitable for cultivation in a variety of climates. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces small, clustered panicles that bear numerous grains. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. This variety is particularly valued for its adaptability and high yield potential in shorter growing seasons."
