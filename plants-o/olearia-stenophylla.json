    "intro": "Olearia stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved daisy bush, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant features narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in coastal and subalpine regions. Olearia stenophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting native pollinators."
