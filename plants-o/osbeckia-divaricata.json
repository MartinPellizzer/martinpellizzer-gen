    "intro": "Osbeckia divaricata, commonly known as the creeping willow or slender willow, is a flowering plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats, with slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, often in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy texture. Osbeckia divaricata is often found in moist, sandy soils along streambanks and in open woodlands."
