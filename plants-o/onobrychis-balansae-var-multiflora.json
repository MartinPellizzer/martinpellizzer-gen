It is a perennial herb characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
