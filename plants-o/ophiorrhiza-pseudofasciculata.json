It is a shrub or small tree that thrives in brackish water environments, often found in mangrove forests. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. It produces yellowish flowers followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Ophiorrhiza pseudofasciculata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
