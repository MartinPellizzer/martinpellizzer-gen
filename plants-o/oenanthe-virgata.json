    "intro": "Oenanthe virgata, commonly known as the common water dropwort, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist environments such as wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in umbels. Its root system is characterized by the presence of rhizomes, which help it spread vegetatively. Oenanthe virgata is often found in disturbed or wetland habitats, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in such areas."
