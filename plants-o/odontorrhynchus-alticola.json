    "intro": "Odontorrhynchus alticola, commonly known as the highland orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in high-altitude regions. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from poor soil, and it has a short growing season. Due to its limited habitat and environmental sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
