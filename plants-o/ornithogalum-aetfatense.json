    "intro": "Ornithogalum aetfatense, commonly known as the African star of Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a bulbous stem with lance-shaped, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Ornithogalum aetfatense is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
