    "intro": "Orchis incarnata var. elatior, commonly known as the tall lady's tresses, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces dense, dark green leaves and bears a striking, spiral arrangement of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. This variety is distinguished from the typical orchis incarnata by its taller stature and more elongated floral structure."
