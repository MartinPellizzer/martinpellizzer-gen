    "intro": "Opuntia cristata, commonly known as the crown of thorns, is a species of cactus native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, flattened stems and clusters of small, spiny pads. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Opuntia cristata is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its succulent stems and having a shallow root system. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
