    "intro": "Orchis maculata var. carnea, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and produces tall, branching stems that bear clusters of showy, pink to reddish-purple flowers. The flowers have three sepals and three petals, with the lateral petals often forming a hood-like structure over the reproductive organs. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
