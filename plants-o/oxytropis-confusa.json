    "intro": "Oxytropis confusa, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are often covered in fine hairs. Oxytropis confusa plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife, though it is generally unpalatable to livestock."
