    "intro": "Opuntia engelmannii subsp. cuija, commonly known as the Cuija prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and are often ribbed. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruit known as tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, making it well adapted to arid environments. The subspecies is notable for its distinctive appearance and ecological role in desert ecosystems."
