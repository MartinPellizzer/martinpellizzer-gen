    "intro": "Oxytropis pulvinata, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and trifoliate leaves that are often covered in dense, soft pubescence. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Oxytropis pulvinata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
