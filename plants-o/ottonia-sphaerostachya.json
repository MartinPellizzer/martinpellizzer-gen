    "intro": "Ottonia sphaerostachya, commonly known as the globe sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces distinctive spherical seed heads that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are narrow and sword-shaped, with a fibrous texture, and it blooms with small, greenish-white flowers in early summer. Ottonia sphaerostachya plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
