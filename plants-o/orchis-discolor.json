    "intro": "Orchis discolor, commonly known as the pale orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, pale purple to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption. Orchis discolor plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes considered a rare or endangered species in certain regions."
