    "intro": "Oreosedum hispidum, commonly known as the rough sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically features a mat-forming growth habit with dense clusters of small, fleshy, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which contribute to its common name and help it retain moisture in arid environments. Oreosedum hispidum thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions."
