    "intro": "Oenanthe stolonifera var. laciniata, commonly known as the cut-leaved water dropwort, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit, which allows it to spread horizontally along the ground. The leaves are finely divided and resemble those of a fern, with a distinctive, somewhat triangular shape. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils near streams or in wet meadows. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in umbel-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer."
