    "intro": "Ornithochilus yingjiangensis, commonly known as the Yingjiang orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip that attracts pollinators. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
