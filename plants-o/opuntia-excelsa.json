    "intro": "Opuntia excelsa, commonly known as the giant prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, flattened stems that are covered in sharp spines and are often segmented. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which are typically followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia excelsa is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It plays an important role in both ecological systems and traditional practices in its native regions."
