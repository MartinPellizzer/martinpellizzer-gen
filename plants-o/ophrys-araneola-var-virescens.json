    "intro": "Ophrys araneola var. virescens, commonly known as the green-winged orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique, bee-mimicking flowers that play a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and the inflorescence features a single, intricately shaped flower with a greenish hue. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this variety is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
