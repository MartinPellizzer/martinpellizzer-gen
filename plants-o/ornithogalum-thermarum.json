    "intro": "Ornithogalum thermarum, commonly known as the hot spring star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial plant native to the volcanic regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its unique habitat in geothermal areas makes it a rare and specialized species. Ornithogalum thermarum is often found near hot springs, where the warm climate supports its growth."
