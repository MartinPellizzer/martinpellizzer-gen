    "intro": "Oreoselis, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melanthiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to the eastern United States. These plants are typically found in moist, shaded woodlands and often grow in clusters. Oreoselis species have attractive, often white or greenish flowers that bloom in the spring. Their leaves are usually lance-shaped and can be quite ornamental, though the plant is toxic and should be handled with care."
