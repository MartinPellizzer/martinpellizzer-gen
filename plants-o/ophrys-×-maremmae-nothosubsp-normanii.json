    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 maremmae nothosubsp. normanii, commonly known as the Norman's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It produces showy, yellowish-brown flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
