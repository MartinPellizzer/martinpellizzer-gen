    "intro": "Orbicularia, commonly known as the \"moon snail,\" is a genus of sea snails belonging to the family Trochidae. These marine gastropod mollusks are characterized by their thick, calcareous shells that are often globular or orb-like in shape. The shell is typically smooth and covered with a periostracum, which can vary in color depending on the species. Orbicularia species are found in tropical and subtropical waters, where they inhabit rocky substrates and tidal zones. Their diet primarily consists of algae, which they scrape off surfaces using a radula."
