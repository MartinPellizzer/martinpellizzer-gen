It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. The plant grows from a bulbous stem and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Ornithogalum wilsonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
