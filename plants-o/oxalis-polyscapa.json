    "intro": "Oxalis polyscapa, commonly known as the clustered wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, woody stem that branches into multiple leafy shoots, giving it its common name. The leaves are heart-shaped with distinctive reddish veins, and the plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, often found in rocky or forested areas. Oxalis polyscapa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and flowers."
