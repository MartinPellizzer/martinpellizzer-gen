    "intro": "Oncidium micropogon var. bahiense, commonly known as the Bahia Oncidium, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange. Its leaves are strap-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps in water retention. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
