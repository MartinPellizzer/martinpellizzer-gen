It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features dense clusters of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. It produces small, yellow flowers during the warm season, typically in spring or early summer. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid and semi-arid environments."
