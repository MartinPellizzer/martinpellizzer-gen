    "intro": "Orchis incarnata var. haematodes, commonly known as the blood orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family native to North America. This variant is distinguished by its vivid red and purple flowers, which contrast sharply with its green foliage. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a slender, erect stem with lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, spurred orchid flowers. Its botanical significance lies in its unique coloration and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
