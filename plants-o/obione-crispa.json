    "intro": "Obione crispa, commonly known as the curled leaf fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Southeast Asia. It features delicate, curling fronds that give it its common name, with a distinctive appearance that resembles tightly wrapped leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands, where it can thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, anchoring the plant and facilitating vegetative reproduction. Obione crispa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in water gardens and bog landscapes."
