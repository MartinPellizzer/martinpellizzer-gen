    "intro": "Omphalocarpum lecomteanum, commonly known as the Lecomte's burrgrass, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its seeds are enclosed in a hairy, three-lobed capsule that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. The species is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
