    "intro": "Oxytropis riparia, commonly known as river milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is often found in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and floodplains. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects. Oxytropis riparia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
