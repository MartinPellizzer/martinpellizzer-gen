    "intro": "Onosma psammophila, commonly known as the sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to hot, dry environments. It has a low-growing habit with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Onosma psammophila is often found in coastal dunes and is considered an indicator species for arid habitats."
