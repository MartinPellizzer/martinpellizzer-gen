    "intro": "Orchis papilionacea var. decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive orchid, is a species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. The plant produces showy, butterfly-shaped flowers that are often pink or purple in color, which can resemble insects, aiding in its pollination strategy. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in its preferred environment. The species is notable for its mimicry of insect forms, which helps it attract pollinators effectively."
