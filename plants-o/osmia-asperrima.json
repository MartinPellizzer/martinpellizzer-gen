    "intro": "Osmia asperrima, commonly known as the rough-tongued mason bee, is a species of solitary bee found in various parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Megachilidae and is characterized by its robust body and distinctive, rough texture on its face and thorax. This bee is known for its unique nesting behavior, constructing its nests in pre-existing cavities such as hollow stems or abandoned bee nests. Osmia asperrima primarily feeds on nectar and pollen from a variety of flowering plants, contributing to pollination in its habitat. Its role in ecosystem health is significant, particularly in supporting plant biodiversity through effective pollination."
