    "intro": "Oreogrammitis multifolia, commonly known as the many-leaved wall-rue, is a fern native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows on rocky or shaded walls, thriving in moist, humid environments. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds. Oreogrammitis multifolia is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
