    "intro": "Orthopogon dichotomus, commonly known as the forked grass or two-branched grass, is a perennial grass species native to various regions of North America. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, prairies, and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Orthopogon dichotomus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
