    "intro": "Orchis ferrieana, commonly known as the Ferrie's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often violet or purple-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for successful germination. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many areas."
