    "intro": "Oplismenus hirtellus subsp. psilostachys, commonly known as narrowleaf buttonweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along roadsides. It has a fibrous root system and can spread through both seeds and rhizomes. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic weed in many regions."
