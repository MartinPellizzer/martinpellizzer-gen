    "intro": "Oncidium dunstervilleorum, commonly known as the Dunsterville orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that typically feature a mix of yellow, orange, and red hues. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are short-lived but highly fragrant, attracting a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Oncidium dunstervilleorum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
