    "intro": "Ophrys lutea subsp. phryganae, commonly known as the Phrygana Ophrys, is a specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female wasps to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in open habitats such as scrublands and grasslands. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its mimicry. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its ecological role and evolutionary adaptations."
