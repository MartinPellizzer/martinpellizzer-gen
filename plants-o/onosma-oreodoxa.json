    "intro": "Onosma oreodoxa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flax, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.
