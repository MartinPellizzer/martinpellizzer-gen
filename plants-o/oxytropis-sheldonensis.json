    "intro": "Oxytropis sheldonensis, commonly known as Sheldon's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Great Basin region of North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and arid environments. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
