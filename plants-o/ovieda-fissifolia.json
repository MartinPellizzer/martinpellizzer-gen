    "intro": "Ovieda fissifolia, commonly known as the fissured leaf tree, is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and legume pods. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly in countries like Brazil and Peru. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive fissured appearance, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its ecological role in seed dispersal."
