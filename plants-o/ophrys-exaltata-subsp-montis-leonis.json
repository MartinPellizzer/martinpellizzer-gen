    "intro": "Ophrys exaltata subsp. montis-leonis, commonly known as the Alpine Bee Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid found in alpine regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in open mountainous areas. Its floral structure is highly adapted for mimicry, with a complex arrangement of petals and sepals that enhance its deceptive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
