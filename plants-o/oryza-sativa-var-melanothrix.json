    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. melanothrix, commonly known as black rice, is a variety of rice characterized by its dark-colored grains, which range from deep purple to black. The coloration is due to high concentrations of anthocyanin pigments, which are naturally occurring antioxidants. This variety is native to Southeast Asia and is often cultivated for its nutritional value and aesthetic appeal. It is typically grown in tropical and subtropical regions with warm, humid climates. The plant has a short growth cycle and is adapted to flooded paddy fields, similar to other rice varieties."
