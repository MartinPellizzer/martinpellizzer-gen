    "intro": "Oncidium \u00d7 kraenzlinii, commonly known as the Yellow Oncidium, is a hybrid orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and green flowers, which bloom in clusters during the spring and summer seasons. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical, and it produces long, strap-like leaves that are dark green in color. Oncidium \u00d7 kraenzlinii requires bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
