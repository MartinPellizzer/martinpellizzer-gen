    "intro": "Orobanche tineoi, commonly known as the Tineo broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers and has a taproot system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is often found growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and health of its host species."
