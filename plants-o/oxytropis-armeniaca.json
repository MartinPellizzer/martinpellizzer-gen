    "intro": "Oxytropis armeniaca, commonly known as Armenian locoweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Central Asia, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, compound leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. It produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by livestock, making it an important plant in ecological studies."
