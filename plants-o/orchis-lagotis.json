    "intro": "Orchis lagotis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to parts of Europe, it thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in several regions."
