It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its fibrous roots make it a valuable plant for erosion control in aquatic environments."
