    "intro": "Oxalis cuneiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves with three heart-shaped leaflets and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stems are often hairy, and it has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. Oxalis cuneiformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native gardens."
