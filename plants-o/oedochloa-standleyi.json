It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in dry climates. Oedochloa standleyi is often used for erosion control and as a forage plant due to its hardy nature."
