    "intro": "Oligogyne tampicana, commonly known as the Florida salt marsh grass, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in brackish or saline wetlands, demonstrating a high tolerance for fluctuating water levels and salt exposure. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like clusters of white to pale green flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Oligogyne tampicana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
