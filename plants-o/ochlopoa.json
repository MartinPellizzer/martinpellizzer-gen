    "intro": "Ochlopoa, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the western Pacific, where they thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Ochlopoa species are characterized by their striking blue or purple flowers and silvery, fuzzy foliage. They are often used in ornamental gardening due to their drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators. The genus includes several species, such as Ochlopoa maritima and Ochlopoa prostrata, which are well adapted to harsh maritime environments."
