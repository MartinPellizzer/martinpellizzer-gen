    "intro": "Orobanche artemisiae-campestris subsp. santolinae, commonly known as the Santolina broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is commonly found in Mediterranean regions and thrives in disturbed soils. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants, particularly those in the Asteraceae family."
