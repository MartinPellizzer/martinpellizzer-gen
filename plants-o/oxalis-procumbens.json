    "intro": "Oxalis procumbens, commonly known as the forest oxalis, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America. It features heart-shaped leaves with distinctive reddish veins and produces clusters of five-petaled yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Its foliage resembles that of a shamrock, giving it a decorative appearance. Oxalis procumbens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and ability to spread through runners."
