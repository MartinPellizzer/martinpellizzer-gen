    "intro": "Oncidium leucotis, commonly known as the white orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has elliptical, dark green leaves that are glossy and arranged in a fan-like pattern. Oncidium leucotis is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. It requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive."
