    "intro": "Opuntia ficus-indica f. decumana, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a cultivar of the opuntia cactus native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are small, hair-like structures. The plant produces large, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red, typically blooming in the spring and summer. Its fruit, known as a tunaf, is edible and contains a sweet, juicy pulp surrounded by a fibrous membrane. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for its use in traditional cuisine and medicine."
