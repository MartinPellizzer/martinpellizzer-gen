    "intro": "Osmia multiflosculosa, commonly known as the multi-flowered mason bee, is a species of bee native to North America. It is a solitary bee that constructs its nests in pre-existing cavities, such as hollow stems or holes in wood. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring, providing a valuable early-season food source for pollinators. Osmia multiflosculosa is particularly effective at pollinating a variety of flowering plants, including apples and cherries. Its role in pollination makes it an important species for both ecological and agricultural systems."
