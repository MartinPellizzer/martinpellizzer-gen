    "intro": "Ophrys caloptera, commonly known as the early purple orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, butterfly-like flower that mimics the appearance of a female bee. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201340 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, showy inflorescence. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by male bees through a process known as pseudocopulation. Ophrys caloptera thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges, and it is often found in calcareous soils."
