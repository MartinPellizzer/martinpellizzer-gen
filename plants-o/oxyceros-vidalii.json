    "intro": "Oxyceros vidalii, commonly known as the Vidal's oxyceros, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many toxic and milky sap-producing plants. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, opposite leaves, and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary forest habitats. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Oxyceros vidalii is considered a vulnerable species."
