    "intro": "Oreosedum subulatum, commonly known as the silverleaf stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to rocky habitats in North America. It features dense, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an ideal plant for xeriscaping and coastal gardens."
