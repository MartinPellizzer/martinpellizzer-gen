    "intro": "Osmia perforata, commonly known as the perforate mason bee, is a solitary bee species native to various parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Megachilidae and is characterized by its distinctive metallic green or blue body coloration. The female bee constructs its nest by chewing plant material, often using leaves of the nettle or other broad-leaved plants. Osmia perforata is known for its unique nesting behavior, where it lines the cells with a mixture of plant resin and saliva. This species plays an important role in pollination, particularly for fruit and nut trees."
