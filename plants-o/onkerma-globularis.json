It is characterized by its dense, spherical growth form, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides it with essential nutrients through photosynthesis. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on bark or rock surfaces. Its slow growth and specialized structure make it an important indicator species for environmental health."
