    "intro": "Ophrys tenthredinifera subsp. villosa, commonly known as the hairy bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or heathland environments. Its leaves are hairy, giving it the subspecific name *villosa*, and it produces showy, yellow-brown flowers with a distinctive bee-like shape. Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
