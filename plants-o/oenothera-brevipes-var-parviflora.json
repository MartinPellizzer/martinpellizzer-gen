    "intro": "Oenothera brevipes var. parviflora, commonly known as the narrowleaf evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pale yellow to white flowers that open in the evening. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. This variety is closely related to other evening primrose species and is valued for its ecological role in supporting nocturnal pollinators."
