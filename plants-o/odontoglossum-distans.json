    "intro": "Odontoglossum distans, commonly known as the orchid with the distinctive toothed lip, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in the dry environments it inhabits. The flower structure includes a unique, toothed lip that aids in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators."
