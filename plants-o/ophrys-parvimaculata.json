    "intro": "Ophrys parvimaculata, commonly known as the small-spotted helleborine, is a species of orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a terrestrial herb that typically grows in shaded, moist woodland environments. The plant produces a single, erect stem that bears a single, greenish-brown flower with a distinctive, intricate lip. Its flowers are often pollinated by bees, which are attracted by the flower's mimicry of female bees. The species is characterized by its small, inconspicuous flowers and is relatively rare in the wild."
