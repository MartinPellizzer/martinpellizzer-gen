    "intro": "Oxalis xerophila, commonly known as the desert wood sorrel, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves and small, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and pink. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from the soil surface. Its leaves are often lobed and have a slightly waxy coating to reduce water loss. Oxalis xerophila is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in hot, dry climates."
