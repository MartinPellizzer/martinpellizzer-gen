It features dense, compact growth with fleshy, cylindrical leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
