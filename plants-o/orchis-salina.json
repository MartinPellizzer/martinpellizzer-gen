    "intro": "Orchis salina, commonly known as the saltmeadow orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It thrives in saline or brackish environments, such as salt marshes and tidal flats, where it has adapted to high salt concentrations in the soil. The plant features a tall, erect stem with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically purple or violet, arranged in a spike and resembling orchid-like structures. Orchis salina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various insects and microorganisms."
