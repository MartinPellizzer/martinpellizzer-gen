    "intro": "Ossea instolonea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant produces delicate, white, spider-like flowers that bloom once a year, typically in the summer months. Ossea instolonea thrives in humid, shaded environments with high levels of moisture and rich organic soil. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from habitat loss, it is classified as an endangered species."
