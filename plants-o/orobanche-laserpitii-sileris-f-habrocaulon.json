    "intro": "Orobanche laserpitii-sileris f. habrocaulon, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and reduced leaves. This subspecies is typically found in grassland habitats and is often associated with specific host plants such as those in the Fabaceae family. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by its host roots. Due to its specialized parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem, though it can be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
