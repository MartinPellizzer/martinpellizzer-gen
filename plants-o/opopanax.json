    "intro": "Opopanax, commonly known as the \"Indian frankincense,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Burseraceae. It consists of two species, Opopanax chironotum and Opopanax hippomarum, both native to the arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. The plant is characterized by its aromatic resin, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and incense. Its small, leathery leaves and woody, aromatic bark are notable botanical features. Opopanax thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in scrublands and woodlands."
