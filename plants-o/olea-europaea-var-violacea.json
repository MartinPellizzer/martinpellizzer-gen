    "intro": "Olea europaea var. violacea, commonly known as the purple olive, is a cultivar of the olive tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple leaves, which contrast with its typical green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by small, round olives that turn dark purple when mature. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique leaf coloration. This variety is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure."
