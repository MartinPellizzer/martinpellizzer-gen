    "intro": "Ornithogalum psammophilum, commonly known as the sand orchid, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its flowering stems are often slender and can reach heights of up to 30 centimeters. Ornithogalum psammophilum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil."
