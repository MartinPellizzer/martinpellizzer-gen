    "intro": "Ophiopogon marmoratus, commonly known as the marble saxifrage, is a perennial evergreen plant native to Japan. It features dense, dark green foliage with distinctive white or light green markings that resemble marble patterns. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink during the late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers well-draining, moist soil. Ophiopogon marmoratus is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
