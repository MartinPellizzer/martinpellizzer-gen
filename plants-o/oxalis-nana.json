    "intro": "Oxalis nana, commonly known as dwarf wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the temperate regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves with distinctive veins that resemble those of a wood sorrel, and small, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Oxalis nana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to spread via rhizomes, forming dense mats of foliage. Its botanical characteristics make it both a hardy and visually appealing addition to shaded garden spaces."
