    "intro": "Obione welshii, commonly known as the Welsh's obione, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
