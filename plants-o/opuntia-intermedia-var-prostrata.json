    "intro": "Opuntia intermedia var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate prickly pear, is a low-growing cactus native to arid regions of Mexico. It features flattened, fleshy stems that lie close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The stems are covered in small, spine-like structures called glochids, which can cause irritation. It produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. This variety is well adapted to harsh environments, storing water in its thick, succulent stems."
