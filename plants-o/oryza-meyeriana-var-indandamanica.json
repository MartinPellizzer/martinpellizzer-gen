It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like morphology with narrow leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, tropical environments, often near coastal areas or in swampy habitats. Its botanical significance lies in its unique genetic makeup and potential for agricultural or ecological research. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
