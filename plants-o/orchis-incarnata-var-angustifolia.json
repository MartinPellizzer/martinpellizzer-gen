    "intro": "Orchis incarnata var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved ladies' tresses, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features tall, slender stems that bear dense, spiraled clusters of pale pink to white flowers. The leaves are linear and narrow, typically arranged in a basal rosette. This orchid thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and wet meadows. Its root system consists of a short rhizome and fibrous roots, which help it anchor in soil and absorb nutrients."
