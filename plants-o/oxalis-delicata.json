    "intro": "Oxalis delicata, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that resemble those of the shamrock. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Oxalis delicata is often cultivated as a ground cover due to its low-growing habit and attractive foliage."
