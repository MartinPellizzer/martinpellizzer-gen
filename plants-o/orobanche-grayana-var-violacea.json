    "intro": "Orobanche grayana var. violacea, commonly known as the violet broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and stems. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-colored flowers, which are often arranged in a spike-like structure. It is typically found in disturbed soils and can be a common weed in agricultural areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the growth of its host plants."
