    "intro": "Ouratea campos-portoi, commonly known as the Brazilian ouratea, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many ornamental and economically important species. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature, contributing to its natural dispersal in the forest understory."
