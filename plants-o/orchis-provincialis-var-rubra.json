    "intro": "Orchis provincialis var. rubra, commonly known as the red marsh orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking red and purple flower spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in wet, calcareous habitats such as marshes and fens, where it forms dense clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are arranged in a spike and are pollinated by bees and other insects. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this orchid is considered endangered in many areas."
