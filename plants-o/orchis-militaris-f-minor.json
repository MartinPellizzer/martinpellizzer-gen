    "intro": "Orchis militaris f. minor, commonly known as the lesser military orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Its morphology includes a slender stem and reduced leaves, typical of many orchid species. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
