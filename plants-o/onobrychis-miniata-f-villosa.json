    "intro": "Onobrychis miniata f. villosa, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces, which give it its specific epithet \"villosa.\" The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It is well adapted to various soil types and is often used in ecological restoration and as a cover crop. Its nitrogen-fixing ability makes it valuable for improving soil fertility in agricultural settings."
