    "intro": "Oncidium ramulosum, commonly known as the ramose orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features a pseudobulb with a single leaf and a raceme of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has a short, erect stem with a few nodes and produces small, clustered roots for anchoring and nutrient absorption. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it thrives in bright, indirect light with high humidity. Oncidium ramulosum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
