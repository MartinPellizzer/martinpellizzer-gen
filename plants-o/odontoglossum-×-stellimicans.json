    "intro": "Odontoglossum \u00d7 stellimicans, commonly known as the star orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and violet. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its pseudobulbs are short and stout, supporting its evergreen leaves that are usually dark green and strap-like. The flowers bloom in late summer or early autumn, adding a dramatic visual element to its natural habitat."
