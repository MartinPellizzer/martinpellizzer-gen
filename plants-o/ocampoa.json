    "intro": "Ocampoa, commonly known as the \"Mexican moonflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its striking, large, white flowers that open at night. The plants typically have hairy stems and leaves, and their flowers emit a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. Ocampoa species are often found in dry, rocky habitats and are valued for their ornamental beauty. Due to habitat loss, several species are now considered threatened or endangered."
