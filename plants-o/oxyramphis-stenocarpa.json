    "intro": "Oxyramphis stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited oxyramphis, is a member of the Ericaceae family, typically found in temperate regions. It is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clustered, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, leathery berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
