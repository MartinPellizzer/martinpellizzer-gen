    "intro": "Oporanthus macranthus, commonly known as the large-flowered sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically succulent, adapted to store water in its native dry environment. Oporanthus macranthus is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is a common sight in desert ecosystems."
