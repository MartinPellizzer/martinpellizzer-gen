    "intro": "Ophrys ciliata subsp. lusitanica, commonly known as the Iberian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It has slender, hairy stems and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
