    "intro": "Ophioglossum vulgatum var. pseudopodum, commonly known as the false sword fern, is a rare and ancient fern species belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, sword-like fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in specialized structures called sporangiophores. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in many regions."
