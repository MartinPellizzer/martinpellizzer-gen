    "intro": "Oberna procumbens, commonly known as the creeping oberna, is a low-growing perennial plant native to specific regions of South America. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered near the base of the stems. Its root system is fibrous and extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in rocky or sandy soils. Oberna procumbens is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging climates."
