    "intro": "Oreopanax pentlandianus, commonly known as the Pentland's arrowleaf, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically large and lobed. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, followed by berries that are toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
