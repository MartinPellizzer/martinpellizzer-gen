    "intro": "Ornithogalum cespititium, commonly known as the clustered star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of star-shaped, white flowers with a greenish tint. The plant is characterized by its bulbous root system, which allows it to store water and nutrients for extended periods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
