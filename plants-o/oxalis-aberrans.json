It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves that resemble those of the true shamrock. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, often appearing in clusters. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Oxalis aberrans is also noted for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a desirable and sometimes invasive species."
