    "intro": "Oxytropis nitens, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow to reddish-purple pea-like flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Oxytropis nitens is adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for wildlife."
