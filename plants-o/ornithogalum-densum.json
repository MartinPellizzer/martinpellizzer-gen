It features a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. The plant is characterized by its underground bulbous structure, which stores nutrients and water. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
