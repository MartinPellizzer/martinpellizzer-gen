    "intro": "Orchis cordigera f. rochelii, commonly known as the Rochelii orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a spurred lip and a compact inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers exhibit a range of colors, from pale pink to deep purple, and are often adorned with intricate patterns. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this subspecies is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
