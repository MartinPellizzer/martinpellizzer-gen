    "intro": "Opuntia lagopus subvar. brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-fruited prickly pear, is a cacti species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, pad-like stems covered in spines and clusters of small, fleshy fruits. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and the stems are photosynthetic, typical of cacti. The subvariety brachycarpa is distinguished by its shorter, more compact fruiting structures compared to other varieties."
