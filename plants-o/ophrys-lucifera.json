    "intro": "Ophrys lucifera, commonly known as the Venus's Flytrap, is a carnivorous plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique snapping leaves that close rapidly around insect prey. The plant's leaves are modified into trap-like structures with sensitive trigger hairs that initiate the closure mechanism. Ophrys lucifera thrives in nutrient-poor, sandy soils and requires a humid, acidic environment to flourish. Its ability to capture and digest insects allows it to supplement its nutrient intake in its natural habitat."
