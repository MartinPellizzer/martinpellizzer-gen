    "intro": "Odontadenia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed grass tree, is a perennial plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like foliage and a woody stem that often remains unbranched. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a fibrous texture, and it is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils. Odontadenia angustifolia is often found in coastal and inland regions, and it plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat."
