    "intro": "Opercularia banksiana, commonly known as the Banksian operculary, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, commonly known as the carrot or parsley family, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Opercularia banksiana is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky outcrops. Its unique operculum, a cap-like structure covering the spores, is a distinguishing botanical feature."
