    "intro": "Orostachys malacophylla subsp. lioutchenngoi, commonly known as the rock sage or desert sage, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to store water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short, upright stems. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. This subspecies is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance."
