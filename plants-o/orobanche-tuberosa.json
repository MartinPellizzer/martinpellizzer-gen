    "intro": "Orobanche tuberosa, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found growing on the roots of various herbaceous plants. The plant has a short, stout stem with no true leaves, and its flowers are typically clustered in a dense inflorescence. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is considered a weed in agricultural settings. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
