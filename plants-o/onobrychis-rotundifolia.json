    "intro": "Onobrychis rotundifolia, commonly known as roundleaf burclover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features trifoliate leaves with rounded lobes and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is characterized by its spiny, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or dry habitats. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it can be used in ecological restoration projects."
