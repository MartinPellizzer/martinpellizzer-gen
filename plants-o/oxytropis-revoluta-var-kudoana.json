    "intro": "Oxytropis revoluta var. kudoana, commonly known as the Kudo's locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems that often bear clusters of small, yellowish to brownish flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by grazing animals."
