    "intro": "Orchis orientalis subsp. turcestanica, commonly known as the Turkestan orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, spurred flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant produces a single, elongated spur at the base of each flower, a distinctive feature of the Orchis genus. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and meadows. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
