    "intro": "Ophrys levantina subsp. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered bee orchid, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flowers that are designed to mimic female bees, a feature that aids in pollination by male bees. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Ophrys levantina subsp. grandiflora is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is valued for its unique floral morphology and ecological role."
