    "intro": "Ophrys lutea subsp. funerea, commonly known as the funeral orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dark brown to blackish flowers, which resemble human faces, a feature common in the Ophrys genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are specialized for mimicry, attracting male bees through visual and chemical cues. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
