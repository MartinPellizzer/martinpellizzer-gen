    "intro": "Ourisia lactea subsp. drucei, commonly known as the Druce's whiteweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with numerous small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
