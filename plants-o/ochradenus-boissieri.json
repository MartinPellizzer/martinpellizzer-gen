    "intro": "Ochradenus boissieri, commonly known as the Jordanian thorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soil. Ochradenus boissieri is often found in rocky areas and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
