    "intro": "Ononis diffusa var. distantiflora, commonly known as the distant-flowered sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous stoloniferous stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This species is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal and inland environments."
