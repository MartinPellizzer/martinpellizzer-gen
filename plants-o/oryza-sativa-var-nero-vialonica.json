    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. nero-vialonica, commonly known as the Black Vialonica Rice, is a unique variety of rice characterized by its deep black grains. This variety is native to specific regions in Asia and is cultivated for its distinct appearance and potential nutritional properties. The plant typically grows to a height of about 100\u2013120 cm, with long, slender leaves and a robust stem. Its flowers are small and green, typical of the grass family, and it produces panicles that bear the characteristic rice grains. The black coloration of the grains is due to high levels of anthocyanins, which may contribute to its antioxidant properties."
