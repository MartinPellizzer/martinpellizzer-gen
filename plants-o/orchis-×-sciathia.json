It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant produces tall, erect stems with showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil efficiently. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
