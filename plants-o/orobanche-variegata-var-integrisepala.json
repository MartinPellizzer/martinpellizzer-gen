    "intro": "Orobanche variegata var. integrisepala, commonly known as the velvet broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of various grasses and legumes. The plant is characterized by its dense, hairless, and often reddish or purplish stems, which can reach up to 30 cm in length. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, arranged in clusters, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in certain regions."
