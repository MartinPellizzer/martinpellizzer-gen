    "intro": "Opuntia littoralis var. austrocalifornica, commonly known as the coastal prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It features flattened, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and small, fleshy flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with moderate to high salt exposure. Its stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in sandy or rocky habitats along the coastlines."
