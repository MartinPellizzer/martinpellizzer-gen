    "intro": "Oncidium exasperatum, commonly known as the Spiky Oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated, spiky flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical, and it produces long, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Oncidium exasperatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
