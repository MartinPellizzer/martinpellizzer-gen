    "intro": "Ottelia philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine water starwort, is a semi-aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow water bodies such as ponds and marshes, where it can thrive in wet or submerged conditions. The plant features slender, branching stems that are often floating or partially submerged, with small, white flowers that appear in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, adapted for efficient water absorption. Ottelia philippinensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
