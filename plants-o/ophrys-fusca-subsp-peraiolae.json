    "intro": "Ophrys fusca subsp. peraiolae, commonly known as the Peraiolae bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, with a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and riverbanks, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing striking purple and yellow flowers that are highly attractive to male bees. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect its dwindling populations."
