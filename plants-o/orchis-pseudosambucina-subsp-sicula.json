    "intro": "Orchis pseudosambucina subsp. sicula, commonly known as the Sicilian false elder orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Italy. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a spurred lip and a distinctive coloration. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its morphology includes a tall, erect stem with several elongated leaves, and it produces small, fragrant flowers during the late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
