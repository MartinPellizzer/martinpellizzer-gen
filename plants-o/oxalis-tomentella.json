It is a low-growing perennial with trifoliate leaves covered in a dense, white, woolly coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy groundcover in arid environments. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
