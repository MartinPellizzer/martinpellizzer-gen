    "intro": "Odontites vulgaris subsp. vulgaris, commonly known as the common toothworts, is a flowering plant belonging to the Boraginaceae family. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in temperate regions. The plant features a rosette of fleshy, tooth-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. It produces clusters of small, blue or purple flowers in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
