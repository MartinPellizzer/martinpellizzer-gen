    "intro": "Odontonema brevipes, commonly known as the dwarf flame vine, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is a climbing shrub that produces striking red-orange tubular flowers, which attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its vibrant floral display."
