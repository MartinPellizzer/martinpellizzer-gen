    "intro": "Oxytropis scabrida, commonly known as scabrous locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, often bristly stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Oxytropis scabrida is also known for its toxic properties, which can affect livestock that consume it."
