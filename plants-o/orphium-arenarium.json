    "intro": "Orphium arenarium, commonly known as the sand orphium, is a small flowering plant native to arid and sandy environments in Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, succulent leaves adapted to conserve moisture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or dry grasslands. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, Orphium arenarium is considered a rare and sensitive species."
