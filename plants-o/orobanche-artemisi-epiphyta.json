    "intro": "Orobanche artemisi-epiphyta, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It attaches to the roots of host plants, primarily those in the sunflower family, to extract nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its life cycle depends entirely on its host for survival, making it a significant concern in agricultural settings. Botanically, it is classified as a hemiparasite, meaning it can absorb water and some nutrients from its host but not all."
