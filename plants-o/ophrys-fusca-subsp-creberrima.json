    "intro": "Ophrys fusca subsp. creberrima, commonly known as the common bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, with a labellum that resembles a female bee, aiding in its specialized pollination by male bees. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. The subspecies creberrima is distinguished by its more frequent flowering and dense inflorescence compared to other subspecies."
