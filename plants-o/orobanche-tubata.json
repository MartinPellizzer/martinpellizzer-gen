    "intro": "Orobanche tubata, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green or yellowish in color. It commonly parasitizes members of the legume family, such as vetch and clover. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
