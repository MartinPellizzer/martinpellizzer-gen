    "intro": "Odontosoria deltoidea, commonly known as the delta spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a slender, creeping rhizome and produces small, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive delta-shaped outline. Its fronds are usually dimorphic, with a sterile and fertile portion, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Odontosoria deltoidea is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded habitats."
