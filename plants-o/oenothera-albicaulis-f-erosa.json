    "intro": "Oenothera albicaulis f. erosa, commonly known as the erosa evening primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly wavy margin. Its flowers are typically borne in clusters at the ends of the stems, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. This variant is distinguished by its more elongated, erosa (rough) leaf surfaces compared to the typical form."
