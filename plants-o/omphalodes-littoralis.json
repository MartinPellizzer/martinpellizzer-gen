    "intro": "Omphalodes littoralis, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is exposed to salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh coastal environment. Omphalodes littoralis is often found in maritime habitats, contributing to the biodiversity of coastal ecosystems."
