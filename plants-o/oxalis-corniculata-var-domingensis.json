    "intro": "Oxalis corniculata var. domingensis, commonly known as the \"Cape ivy,\" is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a trailing perennial that produces small, heart-shaped leaves with distinctive red veins. The plant bears clusters of five-petaled yellow flowers, which bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can spread rapidly and is considered a weed in some regions."
