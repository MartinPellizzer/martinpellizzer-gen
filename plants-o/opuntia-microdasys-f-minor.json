    "intro": "Opuntia microdasys f. minor, commonly known as the miniature prickly pear, is a compact cactus species native to South Africa. It features flattened, paddle-shaped stems that are typically green with a waxy coating, and it produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months. The plant is characterized by its reduced size compared to other Opuntia species, with shorter spines and smaller areoles. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its succulent stems and relying on minimal rainfall. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
