It is a low-growing perennial herb with fleshy, succulent leaves that are often lobed or toothed. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments and it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
