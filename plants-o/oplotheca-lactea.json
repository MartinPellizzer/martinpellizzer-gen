    "intro": "Oplotheca lactea, commonly known as the white milk tree, is a small, deciduous shrub native to the dry regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Oplotheca lactea is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can withstand prolonged drought periods. Its milky sap, which gives it its common name, is used in traditional medicine for various ailments."
