    "intro": "Ophrys garganica subsp. sipontensis, commonly known as the Sipontine orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the southern Balkans. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a specialized lip that mimics female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinct scent. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
