    "intro": "Orbexilum onobrychis, commonly known as narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and shrublands. Orbexilum onobrychis plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
