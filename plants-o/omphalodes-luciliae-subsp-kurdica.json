    "intro": "Omphalodes luciliae subsp. kurdica, commonly known as the Kurdish bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to temperate to alpine climates. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
