    "intro": "Ophrys bombyliflora, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its unique flower structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that enhance the bee mimicry. Ophrys bombyliflora is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, often blooming in late spring to early summer."
