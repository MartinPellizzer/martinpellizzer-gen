    "intro": "Oxytropis leucantha var. depressa, commonly known as the low-growing yellow locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces legume pods that contain small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is typically avoided by livestock."
