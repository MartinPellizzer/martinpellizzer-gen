    "intro": "Orchis zahlensis, commonly known as the Zahler's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Its flowers are adorned with intricate patterns and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
