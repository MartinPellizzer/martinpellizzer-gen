    "intro": "Oestlundorchis obtecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. The plant has a slender, leafless stem that supports its single, small, greenish-white flower. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The species is noted for its delicate appearance and is often overlooked due to its inconspicuous blooms."
