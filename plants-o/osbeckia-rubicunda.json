    "intro": "Osbeckia rubicunda, commonly known as the redstem sandwort, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Osbeckia rubicunda is often found in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats like dunes and prairies."
