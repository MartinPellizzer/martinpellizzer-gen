    "intro": "Oenothera \u00d7 braunii, commonly known as the hybrid evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a cross between Oenothera biennis and Oenothera speciosa, resulting in a species with characteristics of both parents. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening, hence its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Oenothera \u00d7 braunii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique bloom cycle."
