    "intro": "Ophioglossum polyphyllum var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species characterized by its unique morphology. It features a fleshy, club-shaped rhizome and a single, erect, lanceolate leaf that is often divided into two distinct parts. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of the leaf, which are clustered in a distinctive, tongue-like structure. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
