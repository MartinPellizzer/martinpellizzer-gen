    "intro": "Oxypetalum maritimum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers, which are surrounded by spiky, white bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in sandy or saline soils, often growing along shorelines and in dunes. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh coastal environments. Oxypetalum maritimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
