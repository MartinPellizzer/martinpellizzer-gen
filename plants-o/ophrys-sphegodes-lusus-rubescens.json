    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes lusus rubescens, commonly known as the red-bellied bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive red-brown coloration on the lower part of the labellum. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or heathland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
