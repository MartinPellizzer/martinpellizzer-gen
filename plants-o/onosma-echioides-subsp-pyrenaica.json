It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and hairy foliage. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in dense clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats like grasslands and scrublands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
