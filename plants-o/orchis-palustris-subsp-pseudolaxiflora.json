    "intro": "Orchis palustris subsp. pseudolaxiflora, commonly known as the marsh helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland and marsh habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. It blooms from June to August and is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, moist soils. This subspecies is closely related to other orchids in the Orchis genus and is often found growing in association with other wetland flora."
