    "intro": "Oxytropis uralensis var. villososericea, commonly known as the woolly silky locoweed, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its densely hairy, often silver-gray foliage and sparsely branched stems. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is often avoided by grazing animals."
