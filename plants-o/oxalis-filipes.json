    "intro": "Oxalis filipes, commonly known as the threadleaf wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that resemble those of true sorrel, and its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and woodlands. It has a creeping stem that produces runners, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Oxalis filipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
