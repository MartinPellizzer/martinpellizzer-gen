    "intro": "Orchis nivalis, commonly known as the snow orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or mossy habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, hairy coating to retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Orchis nivalis is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
