    "intro": "Oberonia bellii, commonly known as the red-veined orchid, is a species of flowering plant in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, including parts of Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its striking, dark green leaves with prominent red veins and its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. It typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Oberonia bellii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
