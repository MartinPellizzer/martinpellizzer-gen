    "intro": "Orthrosanthus occissapungus, commonly known as the deadly thorned orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family. It is characterized by its intricate, showy flowers that range in color from deep purples to vibrant reds. Native to the high-altitude regions of South America, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its arid habitat. Despite its beauty, the plant contains toxic compounds, making it both fascinating and potentially dangerous to handle."
