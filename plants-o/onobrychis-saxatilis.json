    "intro": "Onobrychis saxatilis, commonly known as the rock burr, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces burrs with hooked bracts, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Onobrychis saxatilis is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration and as a forage plant."
