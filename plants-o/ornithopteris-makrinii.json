    "intro": "Ornithopteris makrinii, commonly known as the Makrinii water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater streams and ponds, where it forms dense, floating mats. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically green and slightly translucent. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of the Dennstaedtiaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ornithopteris makrinii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
