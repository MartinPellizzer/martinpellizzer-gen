    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 alata, commonly known as the winged orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis mascula. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands across Europe. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers with a distinctive wing-like structure on the petals. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in specific ecological niches. Orchis \u00d7 alata plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and moths."
