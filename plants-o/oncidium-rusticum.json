    "intro": "Oncidium rusticum, commonly known as the rusty orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, sword-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. Oncidium rusticum prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its adaptability and ornamental value contribute to its widespread appreciation among orchid enthusiasts."
