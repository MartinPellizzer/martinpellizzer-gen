    "intro": "Ouret persica var. lanata, commonly known as the woolly peach, is a variant of the peach tree characterized by its dense, white, woolly hairs covering its stems and leaves. This unique feature helps protect the plant from excessive sunlight and moisture loss. The flowers are typically pink to white, and the fruit is similar to the common peach but may have a slightly different texture and flavor. It is native to regions of Central Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes."
