    "intro": "Onobrychis kachetica, commonly known as Kachetian burr clover, is a perennial legume native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces cylindrical, spiny pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in steppe and forest-steppe habitats. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
