It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, bushy growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. Oxytropis coronaminis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and fix nitrogen."
