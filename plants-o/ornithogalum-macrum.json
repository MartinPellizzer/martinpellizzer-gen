    "intro": "Ornithogalum macrum, commonly known as the tall bell-shaped lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features tall, erect stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that help the plant survive dry periods. Ornithogalum macrum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
