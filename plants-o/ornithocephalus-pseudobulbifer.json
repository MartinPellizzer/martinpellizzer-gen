    "intro": "Ornithocephalus pseudobulbifer, commonly known as the false bulb orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It features a unique growth habit with a short, thickened stem resembling a pseudobulb, which stores water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a distinctive lip that attracts pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
