It is characterized by its striking, velvety green leaves and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-brown flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Ornithidium vestitum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in specific tropical conditions."
