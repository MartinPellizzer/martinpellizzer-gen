    "intro": "Ottonia carpinifolia f. hirtipedicellata, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed ottonia, is a rare and distinctive plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. Its hirtipedicellata form is distinguished by the hairy texture of its pedicels, adding to its unique botanical features."
