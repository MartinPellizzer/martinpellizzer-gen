    "intro": "Odisha cleistantha subsp. flabellata, commonly known as the Odisha cleistantha subsp. flabellata, is a rare flowering plant native to the eastern Indian state of Odisha. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, flabellate (fan-like) inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often near streams or in undergrowth. Its flowers are usually pale green to white, with a subtle fragrance, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
