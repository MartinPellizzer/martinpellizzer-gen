    "intro": "Oxalis longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that resemble those of true sorrels, with three heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a yellowish hue at the base. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Oxalis longipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and flowering habit."
