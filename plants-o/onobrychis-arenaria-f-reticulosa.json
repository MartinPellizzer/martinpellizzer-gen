    "intro": "Onobrychis arenaria f. reticulosa, commonly known as the reticulate sand clover, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, pea-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is adapted to sandy and well-drained soils, often found in coastal or arid environments. Its unique reticulate (net-like) leaf venation is a distinguishing feature of this form. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
