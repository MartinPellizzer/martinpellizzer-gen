    "intro": "Orchis traunsteineri subsp. russowii, commonly known as the Traunsteiner's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which are typically arranged in a loose raceme. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces showy, lip-like petals that are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
