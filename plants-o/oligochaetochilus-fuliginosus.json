    "intro": "Oligochaetochilus fuliginosus, commonly known as the sooty pleurothallis, is a rare orchid species native to the rainforests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are often hidden among its foliage. It thrives in high humidity and partial shade, typically growing on tree trunks or branches. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
