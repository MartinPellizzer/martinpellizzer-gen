It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers with four petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a velvety texture. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
