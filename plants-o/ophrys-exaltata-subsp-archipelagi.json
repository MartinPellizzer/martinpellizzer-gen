    "intro": "Ophrys exaltata subsp. archipelagi, commonly known as the Aegean bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Aegean Islands. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is adapted to the specific microclimates of its island habitat. Its flowers are usually pale yellow with dark markings, and the leaves are narrow and lanceolate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
