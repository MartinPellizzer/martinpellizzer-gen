    "intro": "Ophrys mammosa subsp. epirotica, commonly known as the Epirotic Fly Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female wasp to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in shaded woodland habitats. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with intricate patterns that aid in mimicry. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
