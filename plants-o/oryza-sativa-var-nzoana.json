It is characterized by its short, slender grains and typically grows in lowland areas with seasonal flooding. The plant has a robust root system that helps it thrive in waterlogged soils. It is well adapted to tropical climates and requires a warm, humid environment for optimal growth. This variety is of interest for its potential in improving food security in regions with challenging agricultural conditions."
