    "intro": "Othonna dentata, commonly known as the toothed othonna, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal umbels. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Othonna dentata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
