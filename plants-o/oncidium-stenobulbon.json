    "intro": "Oncidium stenobulbon, commonly known as the narrow bulb orchid, is a tropical orchid species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with white markings. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in seasonal environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, arranged around the base of the pseudobulbs. Oncidium stenobulbon is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
