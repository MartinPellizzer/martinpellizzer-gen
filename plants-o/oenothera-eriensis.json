    "intro": "Oenothera eriensis, commonly known as the creeping evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems. The plant produces showy yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, while its seeds are enclosed in a hairy capsule. Oenothera eriensis is valued for its ecological role and is often used in native plant gardens."
