    "intro": "Ophrys holosericea subsp. dinarica, commonly known as the Dinaric bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Dinaric Alps. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and rocky habitats, often in mountainous regions. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing showy, yellowish-green flowers with intricate patterns. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and is of significant interest in botanical conservation efforts."
