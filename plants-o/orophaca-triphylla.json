    "intro": "Orophaca triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaf orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often clustered in branched inflorescences. Its leaves are typically three in number, hence the species name \"triphylla,\" and are arranged in a rosette pattern. Orophaca triphylla thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches in the understory of rainforests."
