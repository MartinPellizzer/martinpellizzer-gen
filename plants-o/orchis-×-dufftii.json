    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 dufftii, commonly known as the Dufft's twayblade, is a hybrid orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters along the stem. Its leaves are grass-like and arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists."
