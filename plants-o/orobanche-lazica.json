    "intro": "Orobanche lazica, commonly known as the Lazica broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its reliance on root connections to its host. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is native to regions of the Caucasus and parts of southern Europe. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth of its host plants, making it both a botanical curiosity and a potential agricultural concern."
