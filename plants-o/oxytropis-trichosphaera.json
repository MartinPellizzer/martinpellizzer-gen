It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and pinnately compound leaves with small, hairy leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow to greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on elongated peduncles. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Oxytropis trichosphaera is often found in disturbed sites and is adapted to drought conditions due to its deep root system and hairy foliage."
