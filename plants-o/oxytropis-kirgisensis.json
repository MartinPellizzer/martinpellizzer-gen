    "intro": "Oxytropis kirgisensis, commonly known as the Kirghiz milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant has palmate leaves with several leaflets, and it produces pods that contain lens-shaped seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in steppe and semi-desert regions. Oxytropis kirgisensis is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it ecologically significant in arid environments."
