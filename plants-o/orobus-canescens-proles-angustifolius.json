    "intro": "Orobus canescens proles angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orobus, is a flowering plant species native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically borne on the upper parts of the stems. Its seeds are enclosed in small, pod-like fruits that mature in the dry season. This species is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for local wildlife."
