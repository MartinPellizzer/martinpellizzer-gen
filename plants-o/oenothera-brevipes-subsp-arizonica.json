It is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The species is part of the Onagraceae family and is known for its ecological importance in supporting local pollinator populations."
