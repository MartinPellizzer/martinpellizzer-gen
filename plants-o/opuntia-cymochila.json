    "intro": "Opuntia cymochila, commonly known as the coral opuntia, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are often covered in clusters of small, globose spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia cymochila is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
