    "intro": "Orobanche thymophya, commonly known as the thyme broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, often reddish stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and flies. It typically parasitizes members of the Brassicaceae family, including mustard and cress species. Due to its lack of photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in ecosystems as a specialized parasite."
