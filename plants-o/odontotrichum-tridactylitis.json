    "intro": "Odontotrichum tridactylitis, commonly known as the three-toed sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its morphology includes a compact rosette structure, which helps reduce water loss in its extreme habitat. Odontotrichum tridactylitis is often found in tundra and mountainous areas across Europe and Asia."
