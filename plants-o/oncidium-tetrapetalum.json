    "intro": "Oncidium tetrapetalum, commonly known as the four-petaled orchid, is a tropical orchid species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in clusters of 3 to 5. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves and produces showy, yellowish-orange flowers with four distinct petals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Oncidium tetrapetalum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
