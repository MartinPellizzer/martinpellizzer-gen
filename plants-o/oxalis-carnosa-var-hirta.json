    "intro": "Oxalis carnosa var. hirta, commonly known as the hairy wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive hairy texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Botanically, it belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its calcium oxalate crystals in the leaves, which contribute to its bitter taste."
