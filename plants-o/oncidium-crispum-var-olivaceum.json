The plant features strap-like, dark green leaves that are often crinkled or wavy, giving it a unique appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
