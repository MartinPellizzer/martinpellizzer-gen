    "intro": "Oryzopsis wendelboi, commonly known as the Wendelbo's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered with fine hairs. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and the plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Oryzopsis wendelboi is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat."
