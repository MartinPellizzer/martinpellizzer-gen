    "intro": "Oncidium incurvum var. album, commonly known as the White Oncidium, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its elegant, pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of white, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. The White Oncidium is prized for its long-lasting blooms and is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
