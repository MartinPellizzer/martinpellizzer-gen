    "intro": "Othocallis caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasus sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Othocallis caucasica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
