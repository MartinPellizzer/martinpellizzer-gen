    "intro": "Ornithidium olivaceum, commonly known as the olive green orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a loose spike, which are often overlooked due to their subtle coloration. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in grasslands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
