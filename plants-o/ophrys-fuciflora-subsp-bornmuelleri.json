    "intro": "Ophrys fuciflora subsp. bornmuelleri, commonly known as the Bornmueller's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are predominantly green with brownish markings, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
