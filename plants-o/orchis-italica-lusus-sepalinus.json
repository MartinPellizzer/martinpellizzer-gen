    "intro": "Orchis italica lusus sepalinus, commonly known as the Italian twayblade, is a rare orchid species native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and a single, narrow flower spike that bears a single, pale green or white flower. The plant is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism, relying on specific insect species for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
