It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 inches in diameter, often displaying vibrant hues of yellow and orange. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive periods of drought. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its dramatic appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
