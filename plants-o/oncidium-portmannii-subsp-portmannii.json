    "intro": "Oncidium portmannii subsp. portmannii, commonly known as the Portmann's Oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, showy inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical, and it produces linear, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements."
