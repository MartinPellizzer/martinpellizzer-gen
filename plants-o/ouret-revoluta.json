    "intro": "Ouret revoluta, commonly known as the curled ouret, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Ouret revoluta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its refined foliage."
