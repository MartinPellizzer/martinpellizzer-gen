    "intro": "Oricia lecomteana, commonly known as the Lecomte's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink, with intricate patterns on the petals. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests, where it attaches itself to tree trunks or rocks. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture from the air, a feature common among epiphytic orchids. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Oricia lecomteana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
