    "intro": "Octoceras lehmannianum var. stocksianum, commonly known as the mountain holly or mountain holly fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and lanceolate, serrated leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by triangular, winged fruits. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
