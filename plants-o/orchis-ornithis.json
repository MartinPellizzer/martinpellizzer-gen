    "intro": "Orchis ornithis, commonly known as the bird's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb with a tall, erect stem that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that are arranged in a loose spike, with petals that resemble the wings of a bird, hence its common name. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. Orchis ornithis is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
