    "intro": "Oncidium brownii, commonly known as the Brown's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that often display a mix of yellow, orange, and red hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in conditions with irregular rainfall. Oncidium brownii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its long-lasting blooms."
