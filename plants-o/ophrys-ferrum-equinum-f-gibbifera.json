    "intro": "Ophrys ferrum-equinum f. gibbifera, commonly known as the iron horse orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a male bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and requires specific microclimatic conditions to thrive. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with intricate patterns that enhance their resemblance to insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
