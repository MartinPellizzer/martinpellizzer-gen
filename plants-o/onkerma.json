    "intro": "Onkerma, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, velvety flowers. The leaves are typically round or heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Onkerma thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its popularity as a houseplant stems from its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
