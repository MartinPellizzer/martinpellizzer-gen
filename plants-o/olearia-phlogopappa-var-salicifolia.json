    "intro": "Olearia phlogopappa var. salicifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf tree fern, is a variant of the tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, light green fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, silvery down, which gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and forested areas."
