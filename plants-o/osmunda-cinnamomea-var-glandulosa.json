    "intro": "Osmunda cinnamomea var. glandulosa, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive fronds. It features a tall, slender sterile frond with a broad, flat, cinnamon-colored rachis, from which the fertile spore-bearing fronds emerge. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are robust and capable of forming dense colonies, contributing to its ecological significance. The varietal name *glandulosa* refers to the presence of glandular structures on its fronds, which are a notable botanical feature."
