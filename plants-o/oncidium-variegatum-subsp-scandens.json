    "intro": "Oncidium variegatum subsp. scandens, commonly known as the climbing orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, vine-like growth habit and is often found climbing trees or shrubs in its natural habitat. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, typically with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. This species is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
