    "intro": "Osbeckia glomerata, commonly known as clustered willow herb, is a herbaceous annual plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, ascending stems with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, pink to purple flowers are clustered in dense, terminal heads, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds in dry, capsule-like fruits. Osbeckia glomerata is often found in disturbed or wetland environments and is considered an indicator species for certain wetland types."
