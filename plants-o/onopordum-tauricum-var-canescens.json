    "intro": "Onopordum tauricum var. canescens, commonly known as the Caucasian thistle, is a perennial plant native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, silvery-gray leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy purple or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in regions outside its native habitat."
