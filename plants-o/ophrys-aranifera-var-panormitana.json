    "intro": "Ophrys aranifera var. panormitana, commonly known as the Panormita bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the island of Crete. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive pouch-like lip that mimics the appearance of a bee's abdomen. It thrives in rocky and limestone-rich soils, typically in open habitats such as cliffs and slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
