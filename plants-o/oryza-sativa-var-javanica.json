    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. javanica, commonly known as Javanese rice, is a wild rice species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland environments and exhibits a high degree of genetic diversity. Its grains are generally smaller and less cultivated compared to domesticated rice varieties. This species is of significant interest in botanical research due to its potential for improving rice resilience and yield."
