    "intro": "Oreocarya johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's oreocarya, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its distinctive leaf structures and flowering patterns. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are often hairy and have a serrated edge, while its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
