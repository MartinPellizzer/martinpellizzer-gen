    "intro": "Oreonesion testui, commonly known as the golden sun orchid, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange petals and a compact, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom during the dry season, typically from November to March. Its roots are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. The orchid's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important species in its native habitat."
