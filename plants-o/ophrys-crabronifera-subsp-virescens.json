    "intro": "Ophrys crabronifera subsp. virescens, commonly known as the green bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its unique greenish-yellow flowers that mimic the appearance of a wasp, a feature that aids in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor soils, often in open woodland or heathland habitats. It produces a single erect flowering stem with several showy, lip-like petals. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
