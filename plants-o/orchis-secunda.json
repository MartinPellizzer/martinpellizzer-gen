    "intro": "Orchis secunda, commonly known as the lesser orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, typically found in moist meadows and woodlands. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters of 2 to 6. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, while its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette. Orchis secunda plays a role in supporting pollinators and is considered a characteristic species of its habitat."
