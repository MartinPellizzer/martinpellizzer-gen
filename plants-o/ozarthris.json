    "intro": "Ozarthris, commonly known as the rock rose, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lythraceae. These plants are native to various regions in the Mediterranean and parts of Asia, often growing in rocky or arid environments. Ozarthris species are characterized by their showy, tubular flowers that typically range in color from pink to red. The leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, adapting to the harsh conditions of their habitat. They produce small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, facilitating their dispersal in dry climates."
