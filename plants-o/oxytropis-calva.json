    "intro": "Oxytropis calva, commonly known as the slender locoweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is part of the legume family (Fabaceae) and has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Oxytropis calva is also known for its toxic properties, making it a concern for grazing livestock."
