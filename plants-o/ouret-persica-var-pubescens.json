    "intro": "Ouret persica var. pubescens, commonly known as the fuzzy peach. This variety is characterized by its hairy or pubescent leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant belongs to the Rosaceae family and is a cultivar of the peach tree, Prunus persica. It typically produces small, yellow fruits that are less sweet compared to standard peaches. The fuzzy texture of its foliage is a notable botanical feature, often providing a habitat for small insects and microorganisms."
