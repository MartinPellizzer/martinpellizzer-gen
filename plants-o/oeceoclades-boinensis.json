    "intro": "Oeceoclades boinensis, commonly known as the Bornean tree fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant exhibits a unique growth pattern, with a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread and form dense clumps. Its fronds are bioluminescent in certain conditions, a rare trait among ferns, and it plays a vital role in the ecological balance of its habitat. Oeceoclades boinensis is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
