    "intro": "Oncoba routledgei, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a member of the Burseraceae family and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, with smooth, grayish bark that exfoliates to reveal a lighter underlayer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a glossy surface, while the flowers are small and clustered in panicles. The species is also known for its aromatic resin, which has been used historically in traditional medicine and incense."
