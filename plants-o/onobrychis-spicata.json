    "intro": "Onobrychis spicata, commonly known as narrowleaf burclover, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in spikes. The plant has trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in poor, sandy conditions. Onobrychis spicata is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration and forage production."
