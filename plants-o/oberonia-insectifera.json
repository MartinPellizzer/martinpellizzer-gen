    "intro": "Oberonia insectifera, commonly known as the insect-eating orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is named for its unique ability to trap and digest small insects, a trait that sets it apart from most other orchids. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and good drainage. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptations for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor environments."
