It features silver-gray foliage with small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in spring, which are followed by cylindrical, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for dry landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for native gardens."
