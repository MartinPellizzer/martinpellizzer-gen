    "intro": "Oxytropis carinthiaca, commonly known as Carinthian locoweed, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
