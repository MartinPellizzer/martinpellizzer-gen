    "intro": "Olearia ramulosa var. stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ice plant, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and silvery-gray foliage that reflects light, giving it a frost-like appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in spherical heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value lies in its unique texture and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
