It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe, particularly in countries like Austria and Switzerland. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats with well-drained soils, often in alpine or subalpine zones. Its flowers are showy, with a distinctive violet or purple coloration and a spurred lip that is characteristic of many orchid species. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its beauty."
