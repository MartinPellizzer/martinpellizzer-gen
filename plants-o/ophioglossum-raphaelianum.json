    "intro": "Ophioglossum raphaelianum, commonly known as the Raphael's adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae, which is one of the most primitive groups of ferns. The plant has a distinctive morphology, featuring a short, erect stem with a single, broad, lance-shaped leaf. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered on the underside of the leaf. Ophioglossum raphaelianum is known for its slow growth and is often found in rocky, moist habitats at elevations above 3,000 meters."
