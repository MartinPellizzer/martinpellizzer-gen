    "intro": "Onobrychis viciifolia subsp. collina, commonly known as the mountain vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in poor, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
