    "intro": "Oncidium martinezii, commonly known as the Martinez's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are often short-lived but can last several weeks, and the plant is relatively easy to care for in cultivation. Oncidium martinezii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is popular among orchid growers for its vibrant colors and unique appearance."
