    "intro": "Orobanche clausonis subsp. hesperina, commonly known as the western dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of the western United States. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a root system composed of haustoria, which penetrate the roots of its host to extract water and nutrients. It is typically found in disturbed soils and is often associated with grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in ecological studies of parasitic flora."
