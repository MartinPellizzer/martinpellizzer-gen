    "intro": "Oberonia falcifolia, commonly known as the sickle-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom during the rainy season. Oberonia falcifolia thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and relatively rare species within the Orchidaceae family."
