    "intro": "Oxycarpus sopsopia, commonly known as the moonlight orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, nocturnal blooms that emit a subtle fragrance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters along its stem. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in humid environments. Oxycarpus sopsopia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
