    "intro": "Ophiocaryon neillii, commonly known as the Neill's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in cyathia, a distinctive feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. Ophiocaryon neillii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
