    "intro": "Oxalis sorianensis, commonly known as the Sorianensis wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and undergrowth. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, which can be toxic if ingested in large quantities. Oxalis sorianensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
