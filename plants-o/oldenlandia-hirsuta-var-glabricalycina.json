    "intro": "Oldenlandia hirsuta var. glabricalycina, commonly known as the silky oldenlandia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with five petals and a prominent central column. This variant is distinguished by its glabrous (smooth) leaves, which set it apart from the typical hairy form of the species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
