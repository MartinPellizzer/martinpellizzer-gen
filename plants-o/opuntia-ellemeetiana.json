    "intro": "Opuntia ellemeetiana, commonly known as the desert nightshade cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-like stems, which are covered in small, spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to drought conditions. Opuntia ellemeetiana is also known for its ability to store water in its thick stems, making it well-suited for desert environments."
