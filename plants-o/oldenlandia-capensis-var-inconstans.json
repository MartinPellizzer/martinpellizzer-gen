    "intro": "Oldenlandia capensis var. inconstans, commonly known as the variable milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. This variant is notable for its variability in leaf shape and flower structure, contributing to its common name."
