    "intro": "Ottelia emersa, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its unique ability to float on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater bodies. The plant has specialized bladder-like structures called bladders, which it uses to trap small aquatic organisms for nutrition. Ottelia emersa typically grows in shallow waters and has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are usually white or pale purple and are borne on slender stems that rise above the water surface."
