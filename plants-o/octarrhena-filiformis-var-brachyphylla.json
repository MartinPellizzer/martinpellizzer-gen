    "intro": "Octarrhena filiformis var. brachyphylla, commonly known as the short-stemmed glassworts, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its succulent, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny, green flowers in clusters, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. It is often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other brackish habitats. Its ability to thrive in high-salinity conditions makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
