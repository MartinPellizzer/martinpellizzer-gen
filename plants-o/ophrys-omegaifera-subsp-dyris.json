    "intro": "Ophrys omegaifera subsp. dyris, commonly known as the Dyrian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive dark brown to black labellum that mimics the appearance of a bee's body. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats at higher elevations. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
