    "intro": "Oreosolen alaicus, commonly known as the Hawaiian whiteflower, is a flowering plant native to the island of Oahu in Hawaii. It is characterized by its small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the winter months. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found growing in coastal areas or on rocky slopes. Oreosolen alaicus is adapted to the dry, sunny conditions of its native habitat and is considered a rare and endangered species. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a notable subject in Hawaiian botany."
