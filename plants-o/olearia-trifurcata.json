    "intro": "Olearia trifurcata, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a species native to New Zealand. It is a large, tree-like fern that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its massive, feather-like fronds. The plant has a robust rhizome system that supports its height and provides stability. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow in the dark, which is a unique feature among ferns. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
