    "intro": "Oreopanax spathulatus, commonly known as the broad-leafed arrowroot, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces striking inflorescences with white spadices surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread rapidly in humid, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
