    "intro": "Opuntia atroviridis, commonly known as the black-tipped prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in sharp spines and glochids, which are small, barbed hairs that can cause irritation. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible fruits that are typically pear-shaped and covered in a fuzzy coating. Opuntia atroviridis is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and featuring a shallow root system to maximize water absorption. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
