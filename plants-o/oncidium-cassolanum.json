It is characterized by its pendulous, fragrant flower spikes that bear bright yellow flowers with a green throat. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Oncidium cassolanum is prized in horticulture for its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
