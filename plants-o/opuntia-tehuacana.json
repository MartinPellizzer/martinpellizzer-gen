    "intro": "Opuntia tehuacana, commonly known as the Huastec prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are small, hair-like structures. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible fruit similar to other prickly pear varieties. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. Opuntia tehuacana is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
