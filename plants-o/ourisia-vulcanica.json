    "intro": "Ourisia vulcanica, commonly known as the volcanic ourisia, is a rare flowering plant native to volcanic regions. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils found in volcanic landscapes. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve moisture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of volcanic soil conditions."
