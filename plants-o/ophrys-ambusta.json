    "intro": "Ophrys ambusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to southern and eastern Europe, where it thrives in woodland and shaded areas. The plant features dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking, bee-mimicking flowers that are typically purple or brown in color. Its flowers have a complex structure with a labellum that resembles a female bee, aiding in pollination through mimicry. Ophrys ambusta is known for its ability to grow in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in association with other orchids in its habitat."
