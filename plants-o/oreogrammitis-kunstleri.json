    "intro": "Oreogrammitis kunstleri, commonly known as the Kunstler's wall moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, acrocarpous moss that typically grows on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth form with closely appressed leaves that are often covered in a layer of papillae. Its sporophytes are short and often obscured by the dense vegetative growth. Oreogrammitis kunstleri is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a characteristic species of rocky habitats."
