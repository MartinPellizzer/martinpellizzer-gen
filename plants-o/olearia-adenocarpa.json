    "intro": "Olearia adenocarpa, commonly known as the silver felt tree, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its silvery, woolly leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its woody stems are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which provide insulation and protection against harsh weather. Olearia adenocarpa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to a range of soil types in its native habitat."
