    "intro": "Orobus albus var. unijugus, commonly known as the white orchid of the genus Orobus, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along riverbanks. Its flowers are usually arranged in spikes and bloom during the warmer months, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
