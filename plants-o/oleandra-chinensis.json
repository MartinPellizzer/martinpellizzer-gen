    "intro": "Oleandra chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese oleander, is a flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Oleandra chinensis is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to drought and heat. However, it is also considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native plants."
