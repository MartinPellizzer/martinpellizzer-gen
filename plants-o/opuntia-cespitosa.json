    "intro": "Opuntia cespitosa, commonly known as the Brittle prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and flattened, fleshy stems called cladodes. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and often used in culinary applications. Opuntia cespitosa is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions."
