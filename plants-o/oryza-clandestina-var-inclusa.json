    "intro": "Oryza clandestina var. inclusa, commonly known as the hidden rice plant, is a rare and lesser-known species within the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, elongated leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or wetlands. Its seeds are often overlooked due to their small size and inconspicuous appearance. Despite its elusive nature, it plays a minor but ecologically significant role in its native habitats."
