    "intro": "Ornithogalum rusticum, commonly known as the common star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, round berries that turn red as they mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and rocky habitats. Ornithogalum rusticum is also known for its toxic properties, containing calcium oxalate crystals that can cause irritation if ingested."
