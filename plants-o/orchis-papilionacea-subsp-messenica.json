    "intro": "Orchis papilionacea subsp. messenica, commonly known as the Messenian orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Greece and southern Italy. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns resembling butterflies, a feature that inspired its common name. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its root system consists of a short rhizome and a cluster of fleshy, tuberous roots, which help it survive in its often harsh environment. The species is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral morphology and ecological adaptations."
