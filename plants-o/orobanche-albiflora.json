    "intro": "Orobanche albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its stemless, leafless structure with clusters of small, white flowers. The plant typically parasitizes members of the Brassicaceae family, such as mustard and cabbage species. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots. Due to its lack of photosynthesis, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
