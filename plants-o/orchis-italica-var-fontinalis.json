    "intro": "Orchis italica var. fontinalis, commonly known as the Fontinalis orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Italy. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often in woodland or streamside habitats. Its morphology reflects adaptations to its specific ecological niche, with features such as a well-developed root system for nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
