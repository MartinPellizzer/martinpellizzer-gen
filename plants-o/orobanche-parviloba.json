    "intro": "Orobanche parviloba, commonly known as the smallleaf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to regions of western North America, including California and Oregon. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a root system composed of haustoria, which penetrate the roots of its host to extract water and nutrients. It typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in association with various grasses and forbs. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native range."
