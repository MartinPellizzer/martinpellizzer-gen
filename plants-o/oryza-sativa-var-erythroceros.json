    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. erythroceros, commonly known as the red rice, is a variant of the rice species characterized by its distinctive red pericarp. This variety is primarily cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in warm, humid climates. The red coloration of its husk is due to the presence of anthocyanin pigments, which also contribute to its nutritional value. It is often used as a specialty grain in various cuisines and is valued for its unique flavor and aroma. However, it is less commonly grown for commercial purposes compared to other rice varieties."
