    "intro": "Ophrys rosea subsp. neglecta, commonly known as the neglected orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, bee-mimicking flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces a single, showy flower per stem, which features a complex structure with a lip that resembles a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or grassy habitats. This subspecies is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique pollination mechanism and ecological significance."
