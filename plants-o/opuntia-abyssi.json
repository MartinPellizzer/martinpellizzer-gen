    "intro": "Opuntia abyssi, commonly known as the abyssal prickly pear, is a rare and specialized cactus species adapted to extreme deep-sea environments. It possesses flattened, fleshy stems that store water, a key adaptation for survival in nutrient-poor conditions. Its spines are modified leaves that provide protection from predators and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the deep ocean's limited light zones. Opuntia abyssi exhibits unique biochemical traits that enable it to thrive under high pressure and low temperatures."
