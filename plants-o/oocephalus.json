    "intro": "Oocephalus, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical regions of Africa. These plants are characterized by their rosette-shaped leaves and showy, brightly colored flowers that bloom from the center. The leaves are typically thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. Oocephalus species are popular as houseplants due to their ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements. They thrive in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil."
