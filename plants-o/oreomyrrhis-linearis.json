    "intro": "Oreomyrrhis linearis, commonly known as the narrowleaf oreomyrrh, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its linear, grass-like leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or swampy areas. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Oreomyrrhis linearis is often found in shaded environments and is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
