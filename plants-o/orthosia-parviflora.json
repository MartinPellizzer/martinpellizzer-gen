    "intro": "Orthosia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered orthosia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Orthosia parviflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
