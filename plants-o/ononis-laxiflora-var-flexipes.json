    "intro": "Ononis laxiflora var. flexipes, commonly known as the slender bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial herb with thin, wiry stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are opposite, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
