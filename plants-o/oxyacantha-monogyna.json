    "intro": "Oxyacantha monogyna, commonly known as the single-fruited hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically eaten by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and other sunny to partially shaded habitats."
