    "intro": "Oenothera vinosa, commonly known as purple evening primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that open in the late afternoon and close at dawn. The plant produces yellow-orange capsules containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Oenothera vinosa thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in desert or arid environments. Its flowers are not only ornamental but also attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths."
