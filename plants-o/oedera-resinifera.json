    "intro": "Oedera resinifera, commonly known as the resinous oedera, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and palmate leaves, which are often covered in fine, sticky secretions. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, producing a distinctive resinous scent. Oedera resinifera is known for its ability to exude a thick, aromatic resin, which has been used traditionally in some local communities."
