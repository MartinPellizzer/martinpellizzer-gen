It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and tobacco. The plant is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple in color. It produces small, toxic berries that are often used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities. Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status remains uncertain."
