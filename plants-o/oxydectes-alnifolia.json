It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that resemble those of alder trees. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are an important food source for birds. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a distinctive aromatic scent when crushed. Oxydectes alnifolia is often found in moist, woodland areas and can thrive in partial to full shade."
