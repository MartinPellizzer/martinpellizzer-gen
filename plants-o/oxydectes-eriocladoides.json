It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, typically arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Oxydectes eriocladoides is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
