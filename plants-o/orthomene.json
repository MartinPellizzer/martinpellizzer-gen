It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. The plant is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine, reflective hairs. Orthomene species typically have small, fragrant flowers that are yellow or white in color. These plants are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are also used in traditional medicine."
