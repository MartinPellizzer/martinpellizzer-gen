    "intro": "Orchis szechenyiana, commonly known as the Szechenyian orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tall spathes that can reach up to 50 centimeters in height. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive lip that is often adorned with intricate patterns. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is typically found in meadows and woodlands. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
