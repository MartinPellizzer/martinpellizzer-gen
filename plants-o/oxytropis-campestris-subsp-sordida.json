    "intro": "Oxytropis campestris subsp. sordida, commonly known as the gloomy field lupine, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale purple to nearly white. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it plays a role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility."
