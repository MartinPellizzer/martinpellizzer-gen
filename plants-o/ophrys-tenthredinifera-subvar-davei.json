    "intro": "Ophrys tenthredinifera subvar. davei, commonly known as the Dave's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, with a lip that closely resembles a bee, mimicking the appearance and scent of its pollinator. The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in open grasslands or rocky areas. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific insect pollination strategies for reproduction. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subvariety is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
