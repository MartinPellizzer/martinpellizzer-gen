    "intro": "Oryctanthus archeri, commonly known as the red-hot poker, is a striking perennial plant native to South Africa. It features tall, upright stems that bear clusters of bright red, tubular flowers resembling poker chips, which bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to well-drained, sandy soils. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
