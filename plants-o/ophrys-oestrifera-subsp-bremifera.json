    "intro": "Ophrys oestrifera subsp. bremifera, commonly known as the Bremifera bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with a distinctive pouch-like structure called a labellum. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
