It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers with five petals. The plant has a creeping rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its stems and leaves are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas or along stream banks."
