    "intro": "Osbeckia brazzae, commonly known as the Congo ironweed, is a flowering plant native to Central and West Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which bloom in the spring and early summer. Osbeckia brazzae has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecosystems where it is found."
