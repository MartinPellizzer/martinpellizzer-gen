    "intro": "Onagra biennis var. cruciata, commonly known as the scarlet pimpernel, is an annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that are typically bright yellow or orange, which change color as the plant matures. The leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and the plant has a hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The plant is known for its rapid growth cycle and is often used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
