    "intro": "Opuntia sulphurea var. laevior, commonly known as the yellow prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in soft, pale yellow to golden spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions."
