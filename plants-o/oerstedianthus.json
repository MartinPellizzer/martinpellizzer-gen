    "intro": "Oerstedianthus, commonly known as the \"golden trumpet\" or \"cape gold,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plants typically grow as shrubs or small trees, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Oerstedianthus species are known for their ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, making them well-suited for xeriscaping. The flowers are not only ornamental but also attract pollinators such as bees and birds, contributing to ecological diversity in their native habitats."
