    "intro": "Oxalis lechleri, commonly known as the \"Dragon's Blood Tree,\" is a perennial shrub native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant is renowned for producing a dark red sap, which has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties. Its botanical features include a woody stem and a system of tuberous roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Oxalis lechleri plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting various insect and bird species."
