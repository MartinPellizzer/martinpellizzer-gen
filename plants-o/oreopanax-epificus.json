    "intro": "Oreopanax epificus, commonly known as the rock fig, is a tropical plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, yellowish fig-like structure that develops from the flowers. Oreopanax epificus is often found growing on rocky outcrops and is adapted to thrive in high-altitude conditions."
