    "intro": "Orithyia edulis, commonly known as the edible orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The edible parts of the plant, primarily the roots and young shoots, are used in traditional cuisines and are valued for their mild, nutty flavor."
