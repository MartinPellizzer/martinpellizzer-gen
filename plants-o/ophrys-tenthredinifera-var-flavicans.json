    "intro": "Ophrys tenthredinifera var. flavicans, commonly known as the yellow bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that closely resemble a bee, a feature that aids in pollination by attracting male bees. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It has a slender, erect stem with a single spike of flowers. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is known for its specialized pollination mechanism involving mimicry of female bees."
