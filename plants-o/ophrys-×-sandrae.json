    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 sandrae, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe. The plant features striking floral structures that mimic the appearance of female bees, a feature known as pseudocopulation, which aids in pollination by male bees. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with intricate patterns and are often accompanied by a hairy, bee-like labellum. Ophrys \u00d7 sandrae thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance."
