    "intro": "Odontotrichum goldsmithii var. rowellii, commonly known as the Rowell's golden hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features fine, wiry leaves that are typically bright green and covered in tiny, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects in wetland habitats."
