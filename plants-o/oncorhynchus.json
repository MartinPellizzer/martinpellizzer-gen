    "intro": "Oncorhynchus, commonly known as salmon, is a genus of fish that includes several species native to the Northern Hemisphere. These fish are characterized by their streamlined bodies, vibrant coloration, and anadromous life cycles, where they migrate from freshwater to the ocean and back. Botanically, they are not plants, but the term \"botanical aspects\" might refer to their ecological roles in aquatic ecosystems. Oncorhynchus species play a crucial role in nutrient cycling and are integral to the food webs of both freshwater and marine environments. Their presence is often an indicator of the health and biodiversity of the ecosystems they inhabit."
