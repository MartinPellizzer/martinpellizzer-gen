    "intro": "Ortgiesia pimenti-velosoi var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-leaved ortgiesia, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its glabrous, or hairless, foliage, which gives it its varietal name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in tropical or subtropical regions. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually displaying a range of colors from white to pink. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
