    "intro": "Orobanche alpestris, commonly known as the alpine broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is found in alpine and subalpine regions, often growing in association with grasses and other herbaceous plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, branching stem system. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth patterns of its host, and it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat. Due to its parasitic nature, it is not typically cultivated but is of interest in botanical studies."
