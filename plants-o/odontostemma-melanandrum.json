    "intro": "Odontostemma melanandrum, commonly known as the black-flowered orchid, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, dark-colored flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its leaves are elongated and glossy, often forming a rosette shape. The flowers, which are usually dark purple or black, bloom in clusters and are notable for their striking contrast against the plant's green foliage."
