    "intro": "Ophrys fusca var. lutea, commonly known as the yellow bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and heathlands. Its flowers are usually yellow or brownish-yellow in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. The species is noted for its limited distribution and is often considered a conservation concern due to habitat loss."
