    "intro": "Oncidium scriptum, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that often resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to thrive. Oncidium scriptum is known for its ability to bloom multiple times a year, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its botanical features include pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients, and long, strap-like leaves that help in photosynthesis."
