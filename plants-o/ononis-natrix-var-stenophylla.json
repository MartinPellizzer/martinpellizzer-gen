    "intro": "Ononis natrix var. stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaved bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, white or pinkish flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. This variety is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in sunny, well-drained environments. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, arid habitats."
