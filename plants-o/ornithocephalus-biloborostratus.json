    "intro": "Ornithocephalus biloborostratus, commonly known as the two-lobed beak plant, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, bilobed floral structure that resembles a bird's beak, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. Its leaves are elongated and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its moist habitat. Due to habitat destruction, this species is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
