    "intro": "Ononis subspicata var. picardii, commonly known as the Picard's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
