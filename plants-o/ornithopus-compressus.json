    "intro": "Ornithopus compressus, commonly known as narrowleaf sweetclover, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and often have a bluish-gray appearance due to a dense covering of hairs. Ornithopus compressus is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in ecological restoration efforts."
