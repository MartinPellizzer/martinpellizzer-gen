    "intro": "Ophrys holosericea var. bicolor, commonly known as the Two-Colored Bee Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, aiding in its specialized pollination by male bees. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in grasslands and open woodlands. Its flowers feature a distinctive bicolor pattern, with a pale yellow base and a darker, almost black, upper lip. This orchid is listed as endangered in several regions due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
