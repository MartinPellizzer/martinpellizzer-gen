    "intro": "Oglifa depressa, commonly known as the depressed ogli plant, is a small, herbaceous species native to the temperate regions of the southern hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white and bloom in the spring. Oglifa depressa is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it a resilient member of its ecosystem."
