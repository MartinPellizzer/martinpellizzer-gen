    "intro": "Opuntia maldonadensis, commonly known as the Maldonado prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems called cladodes. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia maldonadensis is adapted to arid environments, with spines that help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in its native region."
