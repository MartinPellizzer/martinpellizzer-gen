    "intro": "Oreorchis discigera, commonly known as the Narrow-leaved Heath Orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It is a rhizomatous orchid, meaning it has underground stems that help it spread and survive in its environment. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions and is often protected in conservation efforts."
