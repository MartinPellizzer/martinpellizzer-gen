    "intro": "Olearia rani, commonly known as the silverweed, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features silvery-gray foliage, which helps it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in its native environment. Olearia rani typically grows in coastal and mountainous regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers, which bloom in spring, are small and yellow, often arranged in a cluster that resembles a dandelion."
