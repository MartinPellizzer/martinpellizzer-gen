    "intro": "Oxypolis filiformis, commonly known as slender hogweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, umbrella-like clusters of small white or greenish flowers. The plant produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts when mature. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Oxypolis filiformis is typically herbaceous, with leaves that are lance-shaped and often hairy."
