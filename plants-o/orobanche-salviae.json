    "intro": "Orobanche salviae, commonly known as the common broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various parts of Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind or animals. Orobanche salviae is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to parasitize a wide range of host plants. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth of its host, making it a challenging weed to manage in cultivated fields."
