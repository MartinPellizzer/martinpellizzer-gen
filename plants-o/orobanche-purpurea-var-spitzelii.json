    "intro": "Orobanche purpurea var. spitzelii, commonly known as the purple broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing members of the legume family. The plant produces showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its root system consists of haustoria, specialized structures that penetrate the host's vascular system. This species is native to parts of Europe and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides."
