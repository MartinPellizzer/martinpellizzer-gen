    "intro": "Oligactis nubigena, commonly known as the cloud-dwelling orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and small, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rock faces or in cloud forests. Its specialized adaptations allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils and high-altitude conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oligactis nubigena is considered a vulnerable species."
