It belongs to the Ophrys genus, which is known for its mimicry of female insects to attract male pollinators. This subspecies typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are characterized by their intricate, bee-mimicking structures, which play a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its unique ecological and evolutionary traits."
