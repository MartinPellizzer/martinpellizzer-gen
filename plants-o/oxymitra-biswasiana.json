    "intro": "Oxymitra biswasiana, commonly known as the Biswas's oxymitra, is a rare and unique plant species native to the tropical rainforests of India. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves and vibrant, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of orange and yellow, are adapted to attract specific pollinators such as bees and birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oxymitra biswasiana is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
