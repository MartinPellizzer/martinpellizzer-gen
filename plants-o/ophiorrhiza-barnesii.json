    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza barnesii, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mangrove, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often narrow leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, making it an important component of mangrove ecosystems. Ophiorrhiza barnesii plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
