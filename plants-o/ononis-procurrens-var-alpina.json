    "intro": "Ononis procurrens var. alpina, commonly known as alpine bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, sprawling stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in horticultural settings."
