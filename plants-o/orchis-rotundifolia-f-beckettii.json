    "intro": "Orchis rotundifolia f. beckettii, commonly known as the Beckett's round-leaved orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its rounded, broad leaves and striking purple or pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in damp, shaded habitats such as woodland floors or wet meadows. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family, known for its specialized pollination mechanisms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
