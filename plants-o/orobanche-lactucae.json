    "intro": "Orobanche lactucae, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is a hemiparasite, meaning it can photosynthesize to a limited extent but primarily obtains water and nutrients from its host. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host plants, such as those in the Asteraceae family."
