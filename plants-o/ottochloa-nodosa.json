    "intro": "Ottochloa nodosa, commonly known as the nodular grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are often covered in short hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Ottochloa nodosa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh climates. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions."
