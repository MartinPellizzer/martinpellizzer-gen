    "intro": "Oxalis lacunosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a distinctive notch, and the flowers have five petals that resemble those of a wood sorrel. Oxalis lacunosa is often used in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
