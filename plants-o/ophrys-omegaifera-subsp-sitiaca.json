    "intro": "Ophrys omegaifera subsp. sitiaca, commonly known as the Sardinian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the island of Sardinia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with intricate patterns that enhance the mimicry. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
