    "intro": "Ochna andravinensis, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Ochnaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, red, fleshy fruits. Ochna andravinensis is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in savanna and woodland ecosystems. Its wood is valued for its durability and fine grain, though it is also used in traditional medicine."
