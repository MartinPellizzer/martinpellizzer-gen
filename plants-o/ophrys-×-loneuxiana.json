It is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera, the bee orchid, and Ophrys insectifera, the wasp orchid. The plant is characterized by its unique floral morphology, with flowers that mimic the appearance of female bees or wasps to attract male pollinators. Its inflorescence typically consists of a dense spike of showy, bee-like flowers. This orchid thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats across Europe."
