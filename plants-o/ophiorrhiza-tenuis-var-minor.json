    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza tenuis var. minor, commonly known as the slender thread-leaf shrub, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that are usually less than 1 centimeter in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its small, white flowers are clustered in racemes and are often borne on short pedicels. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, facilitating wind dispersal."
