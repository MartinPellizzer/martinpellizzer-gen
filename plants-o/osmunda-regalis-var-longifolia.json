    "intro": "Osmunda regalis var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaf royal fern, is a variant of the royal fern characterized by its elongated, slender fronds. It is a perennial fern native to wetland habitats in North America, particularly in the eastern United States. The plant features a stout, creeping rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, arching appearance that contributes to its ornamental value. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Osmundaceae family."
