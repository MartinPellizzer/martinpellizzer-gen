    "intro": "Oryzopsis paradoxa var. eriolemma, commonly known as the silky lemma grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with distinctive silky hairs on the lemma, giving it its common name. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in sagebrush-steppe and grassland habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities in arid regions."
