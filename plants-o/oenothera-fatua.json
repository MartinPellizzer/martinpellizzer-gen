    "intro": "Oenothera fatua, commonly known as the common evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a biennial or annual herb that grows up to 1.5 meters tall, featuring slender stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its seeds are enclosed in a hairy, capsule-like structure that splits open to disperse the seeds. Oenothera fatua is also known for its oily seeds, which have been used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential fatty acids."
