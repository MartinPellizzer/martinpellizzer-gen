    "intro": "Orobanche korshinskyi, commonly known as the Korshinsky's broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of other species through specialized structures called haustoria. This species is found in various regions of Europe and Asia, often in open, disturbed habitats. Its flowers are usually small and pale, with a distinctive appearance that varies depending on the host species. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological systems, influencing the growth and distribution of its host plants."
