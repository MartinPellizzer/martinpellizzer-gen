    "intro": "Oenanthe sarmentosa var. californica, commonly known as California water plantain, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features slender, herbaceous stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats along wetlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are elongated, arrow-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. This variety is adapted to moist to aquatic environments, making it an important component of riparian ecosystems."
