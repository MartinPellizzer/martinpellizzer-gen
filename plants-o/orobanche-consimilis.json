    "intro": "Orobanche consimilis, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is often found parasitizing crops such as wheat, barley, and legumes, making it a significant agricultural pest. Due to its lack of roots and reliance on hosts, it plays a unique role in ecological and agricultural systems."
