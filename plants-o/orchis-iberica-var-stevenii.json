    "intro": "Orchis iberica var. stevenii, commonly known as the Steven's orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to parts of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers with a distinctive yellow-green lip. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodlands or rocky areas. It has a short, stout rhizome and produces a single, erect stem bearing several flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
