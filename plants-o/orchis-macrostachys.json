    "intro": "Orchis macrostachys, commonly known as the large-stemmed orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers arranged in a dense spike, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it often grows in woodland or grassland habitats. Orchis macrostachys is also known for its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
