It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
