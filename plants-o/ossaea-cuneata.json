    "intro": "Ossaea cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant features simple, linear leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in coastal dunes or other dry habitats. Ossaea cuneata plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
