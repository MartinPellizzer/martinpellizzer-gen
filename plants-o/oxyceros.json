It consists of several species, including Oxyceros glochidiatus and Oxyceros spinosus, which are native to various parts of Africa. These plants are characterized by their spiny stems and lobed leaves, often with a waxy coating. The fruit is a capsule that contains seeds surrounded by a fleshy, yellowish pulp. Oxyceros species are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making them resilient to drought conditions."
