    "intro": "Osmundopteris virginiana, commonly known as the eastern royal fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length, with a distinctive, upright growth habit. The plant has a complex life cycle involving both a sporophyte and a gametophyte stage, typical of ferns. Its fronds are divided into segments called pinnae, which are further subdivided into smaller structures called pinnules. Osmundopteris virginiana thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
