It features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped white flowers on slender stems. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. It prefers well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its compact size and elegant appearance make it a desirable addition to botanical collections and native gardens."
