    "intro": "Oncidium diodon, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that bear bright yellow flowers with dark purple markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water to help it survive in dry conditions. Oncidium diodon is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
