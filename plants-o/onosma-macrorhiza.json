    "intro": "Onosma macrorhiza, commonly known as the large-rooted sandthistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, sandy or rocky soils. The plant features a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in late spring. Its taproot system allows it to survive in arid conditions by storing water and nutrients. Onosma macrorhiza is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a characteristic species of Mediterranean scrublands."
