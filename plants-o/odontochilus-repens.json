    "intro": "Odontochilus repens, commonly known as the creeping toothed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread along the forest floor. Odontochilus repens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
