    "intro": "Oberonia brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in lowland forests. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive lip. It is characterized by its compact size and is often found in moist, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
