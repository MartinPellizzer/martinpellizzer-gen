    "intro": "Opuntia megapotamica subsp. chadihuensis, commonly known as the Chadihuense prickly pear, is a cactus species native to northern Argentina and southern Bolivia. It is characterized by its flat, spineless pads and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. The fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and used in local cuisines and traditional medicine."
