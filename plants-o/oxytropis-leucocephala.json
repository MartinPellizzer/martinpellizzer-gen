    "intro": "Oxytropis leucocephala, commonly known as whitehead locoweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and spiny stems. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid environments. Oxytropis leucocephala is also known for its toxic properties, making it a concern for livestock grazing in certain regions."
