It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in late summer, often with a distinctive tooth-like appearance on the petals. The plant grows as a herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with long, strap-like leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy areas.
