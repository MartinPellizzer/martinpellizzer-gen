It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale blue flowers during the spring. The plant has a bulbous root system that stores nutrients and water, aiding in its survival in arid conditions. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. The flowers attract various pollinators, including bees and moths, contributing to its ecological significance."
