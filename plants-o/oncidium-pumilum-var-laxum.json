    "intro": "Oncidium pumilum var. laxum, commonly known as the miniature orchid or small orchid, is a compact orchid species native to tropical regions of South America. It features small, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-green flowers with a subtle pinkish hue. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often in humid, shaded environments. It requires bright, indirect light and well-draining potting media to thrive. Oncidium pumilum var. laxum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
