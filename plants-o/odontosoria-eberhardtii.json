It is characterized by its large, delicate fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, often recurved shape. This plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including parts of India, China, and Southeast Asia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in stream banks and along forest floors. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and can form dense mats, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms."
