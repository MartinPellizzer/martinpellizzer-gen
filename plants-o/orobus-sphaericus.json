    "intro": "Orobus sphaericus, commonly known as the globe orchid, is a rare and enigmatic species native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, globular shape and intricate floral structure, which resembles a small, closed sphere. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale green, often clustered at the top of the stem. Orobus sphaericus is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
