It is characterized by its vivid red petals and sepals, which stand out against its greenish-brown leaves. This orchid is native to parts of Europe and thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a delicate, orchid-like appearance. The plant is often found in association with other orchid species, forming part of a diverse and specialized botanical community."
