    "intro": "Oxythece fabrilis, commonly known as the lace fern, is a delicate and intricate fern species characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces small, green to brown spore cases called sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of its leaves. Oxythece fabrilis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests or along stream banks. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and botanical study."
