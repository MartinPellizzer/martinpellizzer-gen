    "intro": "Oxalis hygrophila, commonly known as the water oxalis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in South America. It features trifoliate leaves with three heart-shaped leaflets and produces clusters of small, delicate flowers in shades of pink or white. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in marshy areas. Oxalis hygrophila is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
