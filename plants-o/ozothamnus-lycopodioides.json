    "intro": "Ozothamnus lycopodioides, commonly known as the coastal flax lily, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing coastal vegetation. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and moderate drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. Ozothamnus lycopodioides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
