    "intro": "Orchis cordigera var. klingei, commonly known as the Klingei Green-winged Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive greenish-blue floral petals and a unique, elongated spur that facilitates pollination by specific insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires a cool, humid climate to thrive. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this orchid is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
