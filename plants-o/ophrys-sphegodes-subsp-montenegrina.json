    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes subsp. montenegrina, commonly known as the Montenegro bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan region. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral structure, which features a prominent, hairy lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and mountain meadows. Its flowers bloom in late spring, producing a delicate, greenish-yellow color with intricate patterns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
