    "intro": "Orania nicobarica, commonly known as the Nicobar orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Nicobar Islands in the Indian Ocean. It is a terrestrial herb with a sympodial growth habit, characterized by its upright, branched stems. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and purple, often with a yellow lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
