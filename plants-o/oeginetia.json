    "intro": "Oeginetia, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. These plants are characterized by their milky sap, which is often toxic and can cause skin irritation. Oeginetia species typically have showy, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, attracting various pollinators. The leaves are usually alternate and may have a waxy texture, aiding in water retention in arid environments. They are often grown as ornamental plants due to their striking appearance and adaptability to different soil conditions."
