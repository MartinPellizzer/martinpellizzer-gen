    "intro": "Orcya, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, elongated floral structure and lack of leaves, relying entirely on its roots for nutrient absorption. Native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, it thrives in wet, swampy environments. The plant's striking white or pale pink flowers bloom during the summer months. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from habitat loss, Orcya is listed as an endangered species."
