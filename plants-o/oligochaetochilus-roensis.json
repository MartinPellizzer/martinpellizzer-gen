    "intro": "Oligochaetochilus roensis, commonly known as the Roen's moss orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant features a slender, creeping rhizome with small, clustered leaves. Its flowers are usually pale green to white, with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
