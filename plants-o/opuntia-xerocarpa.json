    "intro": "Opuntia xerocarpa, commonly known as the desert prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-like stems, which are covered in clusters of small, sharp spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers in the spring, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Opuntia xerocarpa is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping."
