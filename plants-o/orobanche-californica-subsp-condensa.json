    "intro": "Orobanche californica subsp. condensa, commonly known as the California broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to western North America, particularly California. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically parasitizes various species of legumes and other herbaceous plants. Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem as a hemiparasite."
