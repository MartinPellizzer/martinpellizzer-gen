    "intro": "Octarrhena teretifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed palaquio, is a shrub native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its slender, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
