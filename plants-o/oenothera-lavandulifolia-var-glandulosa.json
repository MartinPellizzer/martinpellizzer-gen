    "intro": "Oenothera lavandulifolia var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which contribute to its distinctive appearance and aid in reducing water loss. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinator populations."
