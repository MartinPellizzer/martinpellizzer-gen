    "intro": "Ophrys apifera var. belgarum, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a striking species of orchid native to Europe. It is characterized by its unique flower structure that closely resembles a bee, a feature evolved to mimic the appearance and scent of female bees to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow, brown, and orange, with a distinctive black beard-like structure on the lip. This orchid is a hemiparasitic species, relying on a network of mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake."
