    "intro": "Ophrys scolopax subsp. nestoris, commonly known as the Nestor's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like floral morphology, which features a vivid yellow face with intricate patterns resembling a bee's head. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Its pollination strategy relies on a sophisticated mimicry of female bees, attracting male bees that attempt to mate with the flower. Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, this subspecies is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
