    "intro": "Osmunda lunata, commonly known as the moon's tail fern, is a species of water fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that resemble a trailing tail, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and along stream banks. Its fronds are bipinnate, with small, spoon-shaped pinnae that are often curved. Osmunda lunata plays an important ecological role in aquatic and riparian habitats by providing habitat for various invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
