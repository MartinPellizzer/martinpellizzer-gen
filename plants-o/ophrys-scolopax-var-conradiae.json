    "intro": "Ophrys scolopax var. conradiae, commonly known as the Conrad's bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow with dark markings, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this variant is considered endangered in some areas."
