    "intro": "Oxalis succulenta, commonly known as the stonecrop oxalis, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink, white, or yellow, often resembling those of true oxalis species. It prefers well-draining soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its compact growth habit, it is often used as a decorative ground cover in xeriscaped landscapes."
