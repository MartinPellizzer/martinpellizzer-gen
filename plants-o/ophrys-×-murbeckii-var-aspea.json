    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 murbeckii var. aspea, commonly known as the aspea bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like floral morphology, which features a vivid yellow face with dark markings mimicking the appearance of a bee. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are specialized for insect pollination, particularly by bees, due to their intricate floral structures. This varietal form is notable for its genetic diversity and is often found in hybrid populations with other Ophrys species."
