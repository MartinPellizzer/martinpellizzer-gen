    "intro": "Odontoglossum reversum, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a perennial orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its striking pink and white flowers, which resemble a slipper or shoe, hence its common name. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Odontoglossum reversum thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth."
