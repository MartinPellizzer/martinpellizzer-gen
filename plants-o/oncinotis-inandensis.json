    "intro": "Oncinotis inandensis, commonly known as the Andean buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae, which includes many showy, often toxic species. The plant features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
