    "intro": "Oleandra lomatopus, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Oleandra lomatopus is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems. It plays a vital role in supporting local pollinators, including butterflies and bees."
