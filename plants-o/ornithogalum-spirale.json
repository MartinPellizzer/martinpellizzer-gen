    "intro": "Ornithogalum spirale, commonly known as the spiral lily or spiral arum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, rhizomatous stem and produces a cluster of narrow, spirally arranged leaves that give it its common name. The plant blooms with a single, showy, white to pale pink flower that has a spatulate shape and a distinctive, often fragrant, spathe. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its unique growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to botanical collections."
