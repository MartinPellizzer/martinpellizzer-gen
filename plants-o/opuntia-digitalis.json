    "intro": "Opuntia digitalis, commonly known as the Indian fig cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems, which are ribbed and covered in small, white spines. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its fruit, called a tunas, is edible and has a sweet, juicy flavor. Opuntia digitalis is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
