    "intro": "Ornithidium simplex, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped fronds that form a dense, cup-like structure resembling a bird's nest. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome that anchors it to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad, leathery, and often have a waxy texture. Ornithidium simplex is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in humid environments."
