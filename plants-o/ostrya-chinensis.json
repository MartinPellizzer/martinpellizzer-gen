    "intro": "Ostrya chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese hemlock, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its slender, conical shape and smooth, gray bark. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and oval-shaped, with a serrated margin. Ostrya chinensis is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
