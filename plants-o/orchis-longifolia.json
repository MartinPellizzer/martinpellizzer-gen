    "intro": "Orchis longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, spurred flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often densely packed along the stem, and its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Orchis longifolia is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and moist grasslands, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun. Its flowers, which range in color from white to purple, are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects."
