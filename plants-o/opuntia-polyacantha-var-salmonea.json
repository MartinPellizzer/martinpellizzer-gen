    "intro": "Opuntia polyacantha var. salmonea, commonly known as the salmon opuntia, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and covered in clusters of spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its pads, or cladodes, are edible when fully mature and are often used in traditional cuisine. This succulent plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick tissue to survive in dry conditions."
