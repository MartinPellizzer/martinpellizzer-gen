    "intro": "Orthopogon aemulus, commonly known as the mimic grass, is a striking plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is notable for its ability to mimic the appearance of other grasses, which can make it difficult to identify without close examination. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers. Orthopogon aemulus thrives in wetland habitats and is often found in swampy areas along riverbanks."
