    "intro": "Oreophilus montis-rotundi, commonly known as the mountain-rounded orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded forest clearings. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. Its blooming season typically occurs during the spring and early summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
