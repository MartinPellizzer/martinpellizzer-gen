    "intro": "Oxytropis campestris subsp. scotica, commonly known as Scottish field vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. The plant features erect stems with alternate, pinnately compound leaves, and it produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or purple. It is characterized by its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. This subspecies is native to parts of Europe, including the British Isles, and is often found in sandy or calcareous soils."
