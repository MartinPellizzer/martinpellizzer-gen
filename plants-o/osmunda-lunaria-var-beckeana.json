It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically dark green and finely divided. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Osmunda lunaria var. beckeana is a relatively rare and ancient plant, with a long evolutionary history."
