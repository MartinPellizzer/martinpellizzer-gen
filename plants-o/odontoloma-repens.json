    "intro": "Odontoloma repens, commonly known as the creeping toothbrush plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its root system is fibrous and allows it to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. Odontoloma repens is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal."
