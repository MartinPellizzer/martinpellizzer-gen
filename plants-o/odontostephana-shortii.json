    "intro": "Odontostephana shortii, commonly known as the Hawaiian rock orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in Hawaii. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in rocky or coastal habitats. The plant features slender, upright stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the summer months. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor volcanic soils of its native environment. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered."
