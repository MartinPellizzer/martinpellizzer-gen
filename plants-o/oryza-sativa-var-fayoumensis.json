    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. fayoumensis, commonly known as the Fayoumenese rice, is a less commonly cultivated variety of rice native to Egypt. It is characterized by its slender, elongated grains and typically exhibits a pale yellow to white color when mature. This variety is adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions of the Nile Valley, making it resilient to drought. It has a high yield potential and is valued for its nutritional content, including a good balance of carbohydrates and proteins. Due to its unique genetic traits, it is of interest for breeding programs aimed at improving rice resilience in challenging climates."
