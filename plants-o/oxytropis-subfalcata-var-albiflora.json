    "intro": "Oxytropis subfalcata var. albiflora, commonly known as the whiteflower yellow vetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and it produces slender, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. This species is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a forage plant for wildlife."
