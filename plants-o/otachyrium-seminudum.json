It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with simple, unbranched leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Otachyrium seminudum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded gardens and as a houseplant."
