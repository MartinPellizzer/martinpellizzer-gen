    "intro": "Omphalobium perrottetii, commonly known as the coastal bluebush, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and blue to purple flowers. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in coastal and sandy environments, tolerating salt spray and well-drained soils. Omphalobium perrottetii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing coastal dunes."
