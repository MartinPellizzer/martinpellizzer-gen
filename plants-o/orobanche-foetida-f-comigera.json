    "intro": "Orobanche foetida f. comigera, commonly known as the stinking broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing members of the legume family. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pale yellow or greenish in color. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor, which is thought to attract certain pollinators. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
