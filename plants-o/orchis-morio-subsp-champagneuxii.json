    "intro": "Orchis morio subsp. champagneuxii, commonly known as the Champagne orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of the Pyrenees and is adapted to calcareous soils. Its unique floral structure includes a spurred lip, a feature typical of many orchids, which plays a role in pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
