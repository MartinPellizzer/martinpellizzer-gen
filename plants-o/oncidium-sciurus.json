    "intro": "Oncidium sciurus, commonly known as the squirrel orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, often colorful inflorescences that resemble the tail of a squirrel, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually fragrant and can bloom multiple times a year under optimal conditions. Oncidium sciurus requires well-draining soil and consistent moisture to thrive."
