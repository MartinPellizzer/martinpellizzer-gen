It is characterized by its reddish-brown culms, which distinguish it from other varieties of the species. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, clumping growth habit. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. This ornamental bamboo is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and is valued in horticulture for its unique coloration and structural form."
