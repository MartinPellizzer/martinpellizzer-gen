    "intro": "Otopappus brevipes, commonly known as the short-footed desert parsley, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are finely divided and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Otopappus brevipes is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can thrive with minimal water, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
