    "intro": "Oreocarya lemmonii, commonly known as the Lemmon's oreocarya, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky, arid environments such as cliffs and slopes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and adapted to reduce water loss, a feature common in desert plants. Oreocarya lemmonii is part of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton."
