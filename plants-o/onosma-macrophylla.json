    "intro": "Onosma macrophylla, commonly known as the broadleaf onosma, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long bloom period and ability to attract pollinators."
