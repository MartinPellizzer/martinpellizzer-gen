    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 stenostachys, commonly known as the narrow-stalked orchid, is a natural hybrid between Orchis moria and Orchis stenostachys. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in woodland and grassland habitats. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that are clustered in a spike, characteristic of many orchid species. It has a complex root system and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations in its floral and vegetative features."
