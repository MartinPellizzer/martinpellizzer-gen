    "intro": "Oxalis oligotricha, commonly known as the slender wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant produces edible leaves and flowers, though they should be consumed in moderation due to their oxalic acid content. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. Oxalis oligotricha is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its historical use in traditional medicine."
