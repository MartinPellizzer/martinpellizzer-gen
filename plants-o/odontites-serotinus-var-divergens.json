    "intro": "Odontites serotinus var. divergens, commonly known as the late-flowering toothbrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
