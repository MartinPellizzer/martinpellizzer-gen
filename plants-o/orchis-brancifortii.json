    "intro": "Orchis brancifortii, commonly known as the Branciforte orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Italy. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and requires specific microclimatic conditions for successful growth. Its pollination is primarily carried out by specific bee species, highlighting its ecological niche. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
