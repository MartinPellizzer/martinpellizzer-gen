    "intro": "Ortiga, commonly known as nettle, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Urticaceae family. It is characterized by its hollow, hair-covered stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant contains stinging hairs that release formic acid, causing a skin irritation when touched. Ortiga thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. It is also known for its edible leaves, which can be cooked to remove their stinging properties."
