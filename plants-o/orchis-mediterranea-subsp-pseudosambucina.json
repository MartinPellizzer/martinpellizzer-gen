    "intro": "Orchis mediterranea subsp. pseudosambucina, commonly known as the Mediterranean twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, pale yellow to greenish flower spike. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodlands, grasslands, and rocky areas. It is notable for its specialized pollination mechanisms, relying on specific insect species for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many regions."
