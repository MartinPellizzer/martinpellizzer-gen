    "intro": "Orbea marginata, commonly known as the Orange-flowered Ice Plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, orange-red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
