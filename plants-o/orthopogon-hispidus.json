    "intro": "Orthopogon hispidus, commonly known as the hairy grass or hairy panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to various regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and dry meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough, hairy texture along the surface. Orthopogon hispidus produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family."
