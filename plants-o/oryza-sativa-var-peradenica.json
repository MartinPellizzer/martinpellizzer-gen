    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. peradenica, commonly known as the Indian rice grass, is a wild rice species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with long, narrow leaves and small, clustered spikes of flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and flooded fields, and is adapted to aquatic conditions. Its seeds are encased in a hard pericarp, which aids in seed dispersal and survival in water. This variety is of interest to botanists and agricultural scientists due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to climate change."
