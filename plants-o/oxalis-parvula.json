    "intro": "Oxalis parvula, commonly known as the small wood sorrel, is a delicate herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves with three heart-shaped leaflets and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in woodland areas and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Its foliage resembles that of clover, and it is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. Oxalis parvula is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
