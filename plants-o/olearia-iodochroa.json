    "intro": "Olearia iodochroa, commonly known as the silver frost plant, is a member of the Asteraceae family native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage that gives it a frost-covered appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its overall appearance. Olearia iodochroa thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique coloration and compact growth habit."
