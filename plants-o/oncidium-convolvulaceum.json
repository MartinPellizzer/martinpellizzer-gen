    "intro": "Oncidium convolvulaceum, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking spiral arrangement of flowers, which gives it a unique and decorative appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange with red or purple markings, and they bloom in clusters. Oncidium convolvulaceum prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil for optimal growth."
