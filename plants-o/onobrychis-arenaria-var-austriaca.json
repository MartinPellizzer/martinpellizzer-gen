It features trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. It has a deep taproot system, enabling it to tolerate drought conditions. Its nitrogen-fixing ability makes it valuable for soil enrichment and as a forage plant."
