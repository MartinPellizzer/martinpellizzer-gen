    "intro": "Orobanche cernua subsp. cumana, commonly known as the common yellow witchweed, is a hemiparasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow, erect stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically parasitizes a variety of host species, including legumes and grasses, through specialized haustoria that attach to the roots. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth of its host, with seeds remaining viable in the soil for extended periods. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of agricultural crops."
