    "intro": "Olyra semiovata var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf pandanus, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with a fibrous, spongy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spadices, followed by the development of three-winged, fibrous fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental appeal and adaptability, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes in warm climates."
