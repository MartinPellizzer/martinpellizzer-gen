    "intro": "Ononis elegans, commonly known as slender bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, wiry stems that often lie close to the ground, and its small, white to pinkish flowers bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant has alternate, narrow, and slightly hairy leaves that are usually less than 2 inches long. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands, rocky areas, and along roadsides. Ononis elegans is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
