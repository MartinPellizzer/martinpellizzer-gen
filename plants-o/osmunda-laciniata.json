    "intro": "Osmunda laciniata, commonly known as the interrupted fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that are divided into segments with a distinctive interrupted pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Osmunda laciniata plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
