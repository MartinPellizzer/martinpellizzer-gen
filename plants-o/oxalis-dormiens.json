    "intro": "Oxalis dormiens, commonly known as the sleeping beauty, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that fold shut at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty. The plant produces delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires partial shade to full sun. Oxalis dormiens is a popular choice for rock gardens and containers due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance."
