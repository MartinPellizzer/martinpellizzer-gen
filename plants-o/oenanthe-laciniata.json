    "intro": "Oenanthe laciniata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water-dropwort, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in wetland habitats such as marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. Oenanthe laciniata is often found in shallow water, where its roots help stabilize the soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
