    "intro": "Oligochaetochilus rubenachii, commonly known as the red-stemmed moss fern, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features small, closely packed leaves that are often reddish in color, giving it its common name. It is a non-vascular plant, meaning it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense, and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its entire surface. Oligochaetochilus rubenachii is an important component of microhabitats in tropical and subtropical regions."
