It features striking, pendulous inflorescences with bright red to orange flowers that have a velvety texture. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer, and are known for their strong, sweet fragrance. The varietal name \"rubiginosum\" refers to the reddish pigmentation observed in its petals and sepals."
