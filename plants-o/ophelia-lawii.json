    "intro": "Ophelia lawii, commonly known as the golden water crowfoot, is a flowering plant native to freshwater habitats in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are usually split into three lobes and its bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving waters and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Its roots help stabilize the sediment, contributing to water clarity and ecosystem health. Ophelia lawii is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
