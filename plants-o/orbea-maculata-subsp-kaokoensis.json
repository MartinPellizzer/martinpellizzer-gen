    "intro": "Orbea maculata subsp. kaokoensis, commonly known as the Kaoko orbea, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are usually green with a slight waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
