    "intro": "Origanum saxatile, commonly known as mountain oregano, is a perennial herb native to the rocky regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, gray-green leaves that are aromatic and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, pale blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its aromatic foliage and ornamental value, it is often cultivated for both horticultural and culinary purposes."
