    "intro": "Orthosia thymifolia, commonly known as the thyme-leaved orthosia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Orthosia thymifolia thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and wildflower meadows."
