    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia f. curvata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and a single, upright flower spike that produces a single, pale yellow to greenish-white flower. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland areas, preferring well-drained, loamy soils. It is a herbaceous perennial that blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
