It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, pale green stems and sparse, white spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and early summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
