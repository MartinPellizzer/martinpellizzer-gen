    "intro": "Oenothera insignis, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. The plant features showy yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Oenothera insignis is also known for its ability to produce a large number of seeds, contributing to its resilience in harsh environments."
