    "intro": "Osmia foliata, commonly known as the leaf-miner bee, is a species of solitary bee native to various regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender body and metallic green or blue coloration, which helps it blend with foliage. The female lays its eggs inside the leaves of specific host plants, where the larvae feed on the leaf tissue, creating distinctive mines. Osmia foliata plays a crucial role in pollination, particularly for wildflowers and some agricultural crops. Its life cycle is closely tied to the seasonal availability of its host plants."
