    "intro": "Ozoroa pwetoensis var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ozoroa, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically arranged opposite along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
