    "intro": "Ochna dubia, commonly known as the African angel's trumpets, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often appearing in clusters. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Ochna dubia thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in warm climates. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice in horticulture, though it is toxic to humans and animals."
