    "intro": "Ononis natrix subsp. inaequifolia, commonly known as the unequal-leaved sandwort, is a perennial herb native to dry, sandy soils in Mediterranean regions. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with ascending stems that bear opposite, linear to lanceolate leaves. The leaves are often unequal in size along the stem, giving the subspecies its specific epithet. Small, white to pale yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in early summer. This plant is adapted to arid environments and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats."
