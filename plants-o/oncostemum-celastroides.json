    "intro": "Oncostemum celastroides, commonly known as the creeping sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Oncostemum celastroides is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with thick, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its botanical structure reflects its ecological role as a pioneer species in disturbed or sandy soils."
