    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 disabatoi, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid). It is a terrestrial herbaceous plant that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. The plant produces striking, bee-like flowers with a complex structure designed to mimic female bees, aiding in its pollination strategy. Its inflorescence consists of multiple resupinate flowers, each with a distinctive labellum that plays a key role in attracting male bees. Ophrys \u00d7 disabatoi is notable for its morphological variability and is often found in regions where its parent species overlap geographically."
