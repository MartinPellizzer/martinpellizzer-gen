It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, strikingly colored flowers that display two distinct hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The flowers bloom in clusters, often producing a fragrant aroma that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
