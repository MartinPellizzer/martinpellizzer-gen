    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 maculana, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the early purple orchid (Orchis mascula) and the common twayblade (Neotinea borealis). It is characterized by its striking purple and white flowers, often with a distinctive brownish spot on the lower lip. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of broad, grass-like leaves. The spotted orchid is protected in many regions due to its declining populations and is considered a rare and valuable component of the UK's flora."
