    "intro": "Ornithopus sativus, commonly known as sea rocket, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, branching stems covered in small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its seeds are small and oblong, often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to thrive in sandy or rocky coastal soils. Ornithopus sativus is well adapted to saline environments and is often found in dunes and cliffs along the shore."
