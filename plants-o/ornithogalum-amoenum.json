    "intro": "Ornithogalum amoenum, commonly known as the silver thread lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery bloom, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its roots are tuberous and store nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and unique foliage."
