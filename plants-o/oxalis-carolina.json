    "intro": "Oxalis carolina, commonly known as wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial with heart-shaped leaves and small, yellow flowers that resemble those of the wood sorrel genus. The plant typically thrives in moist, woodland environments and prefers partial to full shade. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, edible fruits that contain seeds. Oxalis carolina is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
