It is characterized by its unique, asymmetrical leaf shapes, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Its small, fragrant flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, fleshy berries as fruit.
