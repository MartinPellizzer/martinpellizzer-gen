    "intro": "Ononis viscosa var. confusa, commonly known as the woolly restharrow, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant thrives in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it a woolly appearance. The flowers bloom in early summer and are pollinated primarily by insects."
