    "intro": "Ormocarpum verrucosum, commonly known as the hairy bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard plants, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and distinctive, inflated seed pods. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal areas. Its leaves are pinnately divided and covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
