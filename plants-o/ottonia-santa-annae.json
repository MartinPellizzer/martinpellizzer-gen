    "intro": "Ottonia santa-annae, commonly known as the Santa Anna's ottonia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its showy, velvety purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as cloud forests, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a distinctive waxy texture, while its stems are covered in fine, soft hairs. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ottonia santa-annae is considered a critically endangered species."
