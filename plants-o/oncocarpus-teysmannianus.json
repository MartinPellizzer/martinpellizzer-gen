    "intro": "Oncocarpus teysmannianus, commonly known as the Bornean cycad, is a unique cycad species native to Borneo. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, linear leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones ovoid in shape. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
