    "intro": "Ophrys cressa, commonly known as the cress-like orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, bee-mimicking flowers that are often yellow or orange in color. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Ophrys cressa has a short flowering period, usually in spring, and produces small, greenish-brown seed pods after blooming. Its unique floral structure plays a key role in its pollination strategy, attracting specific insect pollinators."
