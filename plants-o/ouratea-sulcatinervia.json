It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging leaf veins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often followed by dark red berries. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a leathery texture, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to tolerate partial shade."
