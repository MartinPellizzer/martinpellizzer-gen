    "intro": "Onobrychis belangeri, commonly known as the Belanger's sweetclover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for arid environments. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. Onobrychis belangeri is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and restoration projects."
