    "intro": "Orobanche schultzii var. pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or reddish, tubular flowers arranged in a pyramidal shape. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, often parasitizing members of the Chenopodiaceae family. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots, after which it establishes a haustorium to tap into the host's vascular system. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and productivity of its host plants."
