    "intro": "Odyssea, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It features striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, adapted to thrive in salty, windy environments. Its robust root system helps stabilize sandy soils, making it a useful plant for coastal restoration. Odyssea is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
