    "intro": "Opuntia decumbens, commonly known as the low prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is a sprawling, low-growing plant with flat, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, red fruit. Opuntia decumbens is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system to access water. It is also known for its ability to store water in its stems, making it a resilient plant in harsh climates."
