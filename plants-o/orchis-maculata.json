    "intro": "Orchis maculata, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet or purple flowers with distinctive spots. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, while its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette. Orchis maculata is often found in clusters and plays a role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
