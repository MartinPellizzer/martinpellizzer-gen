    "intro": "Odontochilus rotundifolius, commonly known as the round-leafed toothed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, hairy pseudobulbs and dark green, rounded leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically arranged in a spike. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, porous media for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings."
