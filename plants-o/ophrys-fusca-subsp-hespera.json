    "intro": "Ophrys fusca subsp. hespera, commonly known as the western bee orchid, is a specialized orchid species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, often in mountainous regions. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with intricate patterns that enhance the mimicry. The subspecies is distinguished by its geographical distribution and slight morphological differences from the nominate form."
