It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disc florets. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its small, showy flowers bloom in the fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant produces small, hairy achenes as its fruit, which are adapted for wind dispersal."
