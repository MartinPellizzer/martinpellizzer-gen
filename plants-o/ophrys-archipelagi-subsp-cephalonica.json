    "intro": "Ophrys archipelagi subsp. cephalonica, commonly known as the Cephalonia bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Greek island of Cephalonia. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a bee-like labellum that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky, calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. It is a perennial herb with a short, erect stem and a single, showy flower. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
