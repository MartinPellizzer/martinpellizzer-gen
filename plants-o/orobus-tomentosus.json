The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, often appearing in the summer months. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, rounded leaflets, and the plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Orobus tomentosus is often found in woodland and grassland habitats, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
