    "intro": "Opuntia mojavensis, commonly known as the Mojave prickly pear, is a cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It features flat, fleshy stems that are typically green and covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, often in late spring or early summer. Its fruit, known as a tun, is edible and contains seeds surrounded by a sweet, pulpy interior. Opuntia mojavensis is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and reducing water loss through its waxy surface."
