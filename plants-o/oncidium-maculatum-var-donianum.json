    "intro": "Oncidium maculatum var. donianum, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences with brightly colored flowers that often feature distinctive markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air. Its leaves are usually broad and sword-shaped, and it produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
