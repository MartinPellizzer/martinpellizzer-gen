    "intro": "Odontochilus yakushimensis, commonly known as the Yakushimen stone orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to Japan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and unique, spurred flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its flowers, which are usually pale green to yellowish in color, are notable for their intricate structure and subtle fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
