    "intro": "Onosma angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf onosma, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of blue to violet flowers, which bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Onosma angustifolia is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters."
