    "intro": "Oxalis umbraticola var. macrophylla, commonly known as the giant forest oxalis, is a striking plant native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 15 cm in diameter, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in shady, humid environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil. Due to its unique foliage and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
