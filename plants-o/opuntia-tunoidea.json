    "intro": "Opuntia tunoidea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, spineless stems that are covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia tunoidea thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Its structure and growth habits make it an important plant in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
