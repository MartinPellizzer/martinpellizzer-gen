    "intro": "Ophrys sappho, commonly known as the Sappho orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow with intricate patterns that aid in attracting male bees for pollination. Ophrys sappho is a perennial herb with a short, stocky stem and is often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions."
