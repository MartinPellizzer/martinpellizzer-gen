    "intro": "Ophioglossum vulgatum f. lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceolate adder's tongue fern, is a unique fern species characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae, which is one of the oldest groups of ferns. The plant features a short, horizontal rhizome with a single, erect, fiddlehead-like sporophyll that produces spores. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This variety is notable for its primitive morphology and is often found in woodland areas across Europe and parts of Asia."
