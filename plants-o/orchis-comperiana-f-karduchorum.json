    "intro": "Orchis comperiana f. karduchorum, commonly known as the Karduchian orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a single, showy violet or purple flower with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its leaves are lanceolate and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its striking appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
