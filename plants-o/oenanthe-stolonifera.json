    "intro": "Oenanthe stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping waterdropwort, is a herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and Asia. It features slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively through stolons. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately divided, and often have a distinctive reddish or purple hue. Oenanthe stolonifera thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora."
