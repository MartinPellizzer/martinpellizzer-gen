    "intro": "Origanum vulgare f. viridulum, commonly known as green oregano, is a cultivar of the common oregano plant. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and bright green, aromatic leaves that are slightly smaller than those of the standard variety. The leaves emit a fresh, herbaceous scent reminiscent of oregano but with a more delicate and less intense flavor. This variety is often used in culinary applications where a milder oregano flavor is desired. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a versatile addition to gardens and herb collections."
