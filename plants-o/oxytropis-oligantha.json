    "intro": "Oxytropis oligantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its small, compound leaves and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, hard seeds that are often dispersed by wind or animals. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep root systems and a slow growth rate. Oxytropis oligantha is also known for its toxic properties, containing alkaloids that can be harmful to livestock."
