    "intro": "Orobanche hadroantha, commonly known as the giant broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers and has a highly reduced structure, with no true leaves or stems. It is often found parasitizing species of the genus Astragalus, particularly in open, disturbed habitats. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized plant."
