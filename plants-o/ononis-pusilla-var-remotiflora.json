    "intro": "Ononis pusilla var. remotiflora, commonly known as the distant-flowered bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to rocky and gravelly habitats in the Mediterranean region. It features small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant has thin, wiry stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor in poor, well-drained soils. This variety is distinguished by its more distant flower arrangement compared to other varieties of Ononis pusilla."
