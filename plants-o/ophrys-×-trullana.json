    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 trullana, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flowers that feature a yellow face with a dark stripe resembling a bee's face and body. The plant is a perennial herb with a rhizomatous root system and typically grows in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are highly specialized for insect pollination, particularly by bees, due to their intricate mimicry. Ophrys \u00d7 trullana is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland and grassland habitats."
