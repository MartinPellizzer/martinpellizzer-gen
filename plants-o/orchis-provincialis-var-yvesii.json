    "intro": "Orchis provincialis var. yvesii, commonly known as the Yves' orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, featuring a single, showy flower with a spurred lip. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in shaded woodland areas. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
