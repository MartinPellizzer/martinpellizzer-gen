    "intro": "Onobrychis marginata, commonly known as the white vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a creeping growth habit and produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in erosion control due to its hardy nature. Onobrychis marginata is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits soil fertility."
