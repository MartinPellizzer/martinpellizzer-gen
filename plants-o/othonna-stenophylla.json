    "intro": "Othonna stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf othonna, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and fleshy, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Othonna stenophylla is drought-tolerant and requires minimal water once established."
