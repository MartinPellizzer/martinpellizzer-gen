    "intro": "Orchis latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, violet or purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are often clustered in a raceme. Orchis latifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its roots contain alkaloids and have been used historically in traditional medicine."
