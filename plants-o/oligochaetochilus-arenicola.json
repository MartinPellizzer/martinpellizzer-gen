    "intro": "Oligochaetochilus arenicola, commonly known as the sandhill moss, is a species of liverwort that thrives in moist, sandy environments. It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form. The plant has small, closely packed leaves that are typically green or reddish in color, depending on environmental conditions. It is well adapted to withstand periods of desiccation, making it a common inhabitant of coastal and dune habitats. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores when mature."
