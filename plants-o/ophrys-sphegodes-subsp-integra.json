    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes subsp. integra, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive flower shape that mimics a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and heathlands, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pale green or brown with intricate patterns that aid in attracting male bees for pollination. The subspecies integra is distinguished by its more compact growth and slightly different floral morphology compared to other subspecies of Ophrys sphegodes."
