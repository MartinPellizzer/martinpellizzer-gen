    "intro": "Ophrys oestrifera subsp. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered bee orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance and scent of female bees to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and heaths, thriving in sunny, well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. This orchid is a perennial herb, producing a single erect stem with a few leaves and a cluster of showy, fragrant flowers."
