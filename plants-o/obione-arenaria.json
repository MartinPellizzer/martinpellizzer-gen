    "intro": "Obione arenaria, commonly known as sand verbena, is a low-growing, annual plant native to the Mediterranean region. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to arid environments. The plant typically has slender stems and small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Obione arenaria is often found in coastal dunes and is valued for its resilience and ornamental appeal."
