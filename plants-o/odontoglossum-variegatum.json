    "intro": "Odontoglossum variegatum, commonly known as the variegated orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its strikingly variegated leaves, which display a mix of green, white, and sometimes yellow patterns. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale purple. It thrives in cool, high-altitude environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
