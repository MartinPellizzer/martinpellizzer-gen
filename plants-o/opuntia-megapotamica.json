    "intro": "Opuntia megapotamica, commonly known as the South American prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in spines and are used for photosynthesis. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible fruits called tunas. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick stems. Opuntia megapotamica is also valued for its ornamental use and has traditional uses in some cultures for food and medicine."
