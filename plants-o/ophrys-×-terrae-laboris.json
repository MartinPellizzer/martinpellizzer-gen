It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a specialized lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its flowers are often pale yellow or brown, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. This orchid is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its evolutionary significance and ecological niche."
