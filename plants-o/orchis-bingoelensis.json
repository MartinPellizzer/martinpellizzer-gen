    "intro": "Orchis bingoelensis, commonly known as the Bingoelensian orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to a small region in southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a single, strikingly colored flower with a complex lip and column typical of the Orchidaceae family. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, humus-filled soil. Its blooming period occurs in late spring, producing flowers that range from pale pink to deep purple. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
