    "intro": "Ononis alopecuroides var. trifoliata, commonly known as three-leaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are typically trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
