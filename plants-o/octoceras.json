    "intro": "Octoceras, commonly known as the eight-armed sea cucumber, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the phylum Echinodermata. It is characterized by its unique body structure, which includes a soft, elongated body with eight arms extending from its central trunk. These arms are covered in tiny, tube-like structures called aciculae, which aid in feeding and respiration. Octoceras inhabits deep-sea environments and is typically found in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Its ecological role is significant in deep-sea ecosystems, where it contributes to nutrient cycling and serves as prey for various marine predators."
