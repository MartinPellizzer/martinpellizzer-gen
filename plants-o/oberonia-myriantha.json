    "intro": "Oberonia myriantha, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces intricate, spurred orchid flowers with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
