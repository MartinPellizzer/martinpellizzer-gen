    "intro": "Ornithocephalus garayi, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant prefers cool, humid environments and is often found growing in rocky or alpine habitats. Its roots are adapted to anchor in loose soil and absorb moisture from the air. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
