It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often divided into two parts, giving it its common name. The plant produces delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its foliage and flowers are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants."
