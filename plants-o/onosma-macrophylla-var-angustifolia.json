    "intro": "Onosma macrophylla var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved onosma, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a silvery-blue underside. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and extended flowering period."
