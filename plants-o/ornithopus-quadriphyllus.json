It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.

Ornithopus quadriphyllus is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
