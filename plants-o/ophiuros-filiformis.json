    "intro": "Ophiuros filiformis, commonly known as the slender sea whip, is a marine organism belonging to the phylum Cnidaria. It is characterized by its long, filamentous polyps that extend from a central axis, forming a delicate, whip-like structure. This species is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches itself to rocky substrates using a basal holdfast. Its translucent, tubular bodies are often adorned with tiny, stinging cells called nematocysts, which it uses for capturing prey. Ophiuros filiformis plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to the biodiversity of coral reef and rocky shore habitats."
