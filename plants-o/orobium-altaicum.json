    "intro": "Orobium altaicum, commonly known as the high mountain bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its flowers bloom in late summer. Orobium altaicum plays a role in stabilizing alpine ecosystems and provides nectar for pollinators in its habitat."
