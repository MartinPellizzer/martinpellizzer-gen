    "intro": "Obione griffithsii, commonly known as the Griffiths' obione, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to violet. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. Its blooming period occurs during the spring and early summer months, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Obione griffithsii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
