    "intro": "Ononis hispida var. pseudohispida, commonly known as the rough hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright stems and basal leaves that are hairy and lobed. The plant produces bright yellow composite flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its hirsute appearance and medicinal properties have made it a subject of botanical interest."
