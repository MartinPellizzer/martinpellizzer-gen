    "intro": "Ophrys holosericea var. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral structure, which plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a yellowish hue, often with a distinct, elongated lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee. It thrives in rocky or calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
