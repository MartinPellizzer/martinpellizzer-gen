It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that resemble butterflies, hence its common name. The plant produces a single, spurred orchid flower with a distinctive violet or purple coloration. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. The orchid is pollinated primarily by bees and is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
