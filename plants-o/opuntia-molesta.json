    "intro": "Opuntia molesta, commonly known as the Devil's tongue, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems, which are covered in sharp spines and glochids, making it both distinctive and potentially hazardous to handle. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia molesta is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid environments, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its rapid growth and ability to propagate through offsets make it both a resilient and sometimes invasive species."
