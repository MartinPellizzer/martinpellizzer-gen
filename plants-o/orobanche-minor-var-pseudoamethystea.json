    "intro": "Orobanche minor var. pseudoamethystea, commonly known as the purple dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed habitats and is often found parasitizing species within the Fabaceae family. Its unique morphology includes a short, fleshy stem and small, scale-like leaves. Due to its specialized parasitic nature, it plays a role in ecological interactions but is also considered a weed in agricultural settings."
