    "intro": "Oxytropis diffusa, commonly known as yellow milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to dry environments, with deep taproots that allow it to access groundwater. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature. However, it can become invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
