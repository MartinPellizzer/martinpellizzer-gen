    "intro": "Orchis laxiflora var. palustris, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in Europe. It produces tall, flowering stems with showy, violet-blue flowers arranged in a loose spike. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This orchid is an important species for pollinators and is often found in peat bogs and marshes."
