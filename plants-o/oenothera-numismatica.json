    "intro": "Oenothera numismatica, commonly known as the silverleaf evening primrose, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and showy yellow flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant belongs to the Onagraceae family and is known for its unique seed structure, which consists of a single, elongated seed enclosed in a papery capsule. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Oenothera numismatica is also noted for its medicinal properties, particularly due to the presence of essential fatty acids in its seeds."
