    "intro": "Opuntia rauppiana, commonly known as the Raupp's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy pads, known as cladodes, which are covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Opuntia rauppiana is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, succulent stems. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert animals."
