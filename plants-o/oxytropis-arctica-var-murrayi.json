    "intro": "Oxytropis arctica var. murrayi, commonly known as Arctic locoweed, is a perennial legume native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. It possesses a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which helps it survive in harsh environments. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, and the plant is often found in tundra and alpine habitats."
