    "intro": "Ochlandra capitata, commonly known as the clustered sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a sprawling habit, characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, club-shaped clusters at the ends of its stems. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system adapted to poor, sandy soils and a ability to store water in its leaves. Ochlandra capitata is often found in coastal dunes and other disturbed habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
