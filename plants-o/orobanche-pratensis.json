    "intro": "Orobanche pratensis, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a root-parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is often found in grasslands and meadows. The plant produces small, pale yellow or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, typically grasses and sedges, which provide the necessary resources for its growth. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the health of its host plants."
