    "intro": "Oxybasis erosa, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, and it produces showy pink or purple flowers that attract pollinators. Oxybasis erosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
