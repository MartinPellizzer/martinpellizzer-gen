It is characterized by its distinctive, milky-white leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy textures. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
