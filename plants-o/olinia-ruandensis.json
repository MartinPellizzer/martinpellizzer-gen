    "intro": "Olinia ruandensis, commonly known as the Rwandan olive, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to olives, containing a single seed surrounded by a fleshy pulp. Olinia ruandensis is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as montane forests and is valued for its ornamental and potential economic uses."
