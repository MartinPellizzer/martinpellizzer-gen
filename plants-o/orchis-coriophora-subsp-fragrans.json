    "intro": "Orchis coriophora subsp. fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wet meadows and marshes in Europe. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and tall, branched flower spikes. The flowers are typically pale green to yellowish with a distinctive, fragrant scent, which aids in attracting pollinators. This subspecies is notable for its specialized adaptation to moist, nutrient-poor habitats. It plays an important ecological role in supporting insect biodiversity in its native environment."
