    "intro": "Oncidium croesus, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling a crown, hence its common name. The plant has long, strap-like leaves and thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements. Oncidium croesus is also known for its ability to bloom multiple times a year under proper conditions."
