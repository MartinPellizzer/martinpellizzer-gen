    "intro": "Oreinotinus stenocalyx, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oreinotinus stenocalyx is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
