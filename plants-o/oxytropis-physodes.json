    "intro": "Oxytropis physodes, commonly known as the purple milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, hairy stems, and clusters of small, violet to purple flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with numerous leaflets, and it produces lens-shaped, brown pods that contain several seeds. Oxytropis physodes is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and prairie habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria in its root system."
