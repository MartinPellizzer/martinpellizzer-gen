    "intro": "Ocymastrum angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ocymastrum, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, tubular flowers are typically pale blue or purple, arranged in dense clusters. Ocymastrum angustifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
