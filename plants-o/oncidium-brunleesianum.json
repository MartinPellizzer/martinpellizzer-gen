    "intro": "Oncidium brunleesianum, commonly known as the Brunlesian orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, showy inflorescences that bear multiple fragrant, yellowish-orange flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, often in clusters that can last for several weeks. Oncidium brunleesianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
