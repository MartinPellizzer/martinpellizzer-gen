    "intro": "Onobrychis conferta f. subsericea, commonly known as the silky burr vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, trifoliate leaves with a soft, hairy texture. The plant produces elongated, spiny pods that contain small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
