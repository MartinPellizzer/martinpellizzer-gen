    "intro": "Onosma graniticola, commonly known as the granitic hoaryweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid and rocky regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is adapted to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. Onosma graniticola is often found in limestone and granitic substrates, making it a typical member of Mediterranean and semi-arid ecosystems."
