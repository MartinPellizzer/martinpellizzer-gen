    "intro": "Oxalis saliciformis, commonly known as the willowleaf wood sorrel, is a herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that resemble willow leaves, with three heart-shaped lobes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or woodland settings. Oxalis saliciformis is also noted for its ability to spread via stolons, forming dense mats in favorable conditions."
