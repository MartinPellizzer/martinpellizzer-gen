    "intro": "Oxalis vulcanicola, commonly known as the volcanic oxalis, is a unique plant species native to volcanic regions. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, delicate flowers. The plant thrives in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils often found in volcanic soils. Its growth is closely tied to the specific microclimates of its habitat, which include high humidity and moderate temperatures. Oxalis vulcanicola plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment and supports local biodiversity."
