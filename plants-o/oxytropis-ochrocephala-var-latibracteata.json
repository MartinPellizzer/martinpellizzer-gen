It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by livestock and can be a weed in agricultural areas."
