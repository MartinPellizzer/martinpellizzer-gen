    "intro": "Ophrys hespera, commonly known as the Western bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower that is typically yellow or orange in color, with intricate patterns that attract male bees for pollination. Ophrys hespera thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species in many areas."
