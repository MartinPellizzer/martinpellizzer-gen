    "intro": "Ophrys heldreichii subsp. polyxo, commonly known as the Heldreich's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a complex, labellum that mimics the appearance of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pale green or brown, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
