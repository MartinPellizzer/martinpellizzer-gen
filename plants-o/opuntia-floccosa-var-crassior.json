    "intro": "Opuntia floccosa var. crassior, commonly known as the thick-stemmed prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are often covered in dense clusters of spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tunaf, is a large, spiny berry that ripens to a red or purple color. This species is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
