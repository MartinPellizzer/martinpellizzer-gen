It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Osmorhiza depauperata is considered threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
