    "intro": "Opuntia soehrensii, commonly known as the Soehrens' prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spiny areoles, which bear both flowers and glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red or purple fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Opuntia soehrensii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
