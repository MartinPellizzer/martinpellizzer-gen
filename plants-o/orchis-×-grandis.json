    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 grandis, commonly known as the large-flowered orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis anthropophora. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant produces showy, violet to purple flowers with a distinctive lip, which is a characteristic feature of many orchid species. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, while its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette. Orchis \u00d7 grandis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in botanical gardens and natural habitats across Europe."
