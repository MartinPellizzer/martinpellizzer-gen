    "intro": "Oreomyrrhis colensoi, commonly known as the Colenso's lily, is a rare and endangered plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its leaves are long and strap-like, and it produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is highly threatened and requires conservation efforts to survive."
