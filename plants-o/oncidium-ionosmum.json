    "intro": "Oncidium ionosmum, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, drooping inflorescences that bear clusters of bright yellow, butterfly-like flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Oncidium ionosmum is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively ease of cultivation in suitable conditions."
