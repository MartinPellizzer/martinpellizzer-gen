    "intro": "Orontium supinum, commonly known as the swamp waterplantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along the banks of rivers. The plant has broad, waxy leaves that are usually floating or submerged, and it produces small, white or greenish flowers in clusters. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil, contributing to the ecological health of wetland habitats. Orontium supinum plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
