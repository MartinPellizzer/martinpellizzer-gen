It is a low-growing perennial with slender, branched stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its adaptations to dry environments include reduced leaf surface area and deep root systems for water absorption. Ononis longearistata is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in disturbed or open habitats."
