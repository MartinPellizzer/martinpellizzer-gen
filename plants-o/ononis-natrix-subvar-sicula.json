It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, cylindrical fruits called achenes, which are typically dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or disturbed habitats. Sicilian bedstraw is valued for its ornamental appeal and has historical uses in herbal medicine."
