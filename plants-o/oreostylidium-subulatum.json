    "intro": "Oreostylidium subulatum, commonly known as the slender leaf orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the high elevations of South America. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and produces striking, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are often clustered in loose racemes, and the species is known for its unique morphological adaptations to its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
