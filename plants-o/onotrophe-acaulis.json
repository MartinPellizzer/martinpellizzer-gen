    "intro": "Onotrophe acaulis, commonly known as the naked-stemmed bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its lack of a true stem, with the leaves directly arising from the root system. The plant produces showy blue to purple bell-shaped flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its delicate structure and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
