    "intro": "Oxalis adoensis, commonly known as the velvetleaf wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Oxalis adoensis thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a common ornamental in tropical gardens. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
