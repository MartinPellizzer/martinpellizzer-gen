    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 eichenfeldtii, commonly known as the Eichenfeldt's orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis purpurea. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of violet to purple flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodlands and meadows across Europe. It blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
