    "intro": "Oeonia curvata, commonly known as the curlyleaf watermilfoil, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that are often curved or twisted, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater habitats such as lakes, ponds, and streams. Its small, green flowers appear in dense clusters and bloom from June to August. Oeonia curvata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
