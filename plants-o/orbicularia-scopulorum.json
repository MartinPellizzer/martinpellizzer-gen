It is characterized by its thick, fleshy, orb-shaped stems and leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments. Orbicularia scopulorum is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance."
