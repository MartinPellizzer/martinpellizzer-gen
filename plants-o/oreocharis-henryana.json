    "intro": "Oreocharis henryana, commonly known as the Henry's oreocharis, is a rare flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are opposite in arrangement, and it thrives in shaded, humid environments. It is often found in rocky crevices and forest understories, where it forms dense clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
