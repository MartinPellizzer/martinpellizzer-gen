    "intro": "Olearia ciliata var. squamifolia, commonly known as the silver-haired daisy, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It features silver-gray foliage due to dense, fine hairs covering its leaves. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a coastal plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its silvery appearance and hardy nature."
