    "intro": "Oxytropis martjanovii, commonly known as the Siberian locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the steppes and mountains of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellow to green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and are often covered in fine hairs. Oxytropis martjanovii is adapted to dry, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
