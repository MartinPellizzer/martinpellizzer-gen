    "intro": "Orchis anatolica f. rariflora, commonly known as the rare-flowered Anatolian orchid, is a botanical variant of the broader Orchis anatolica species. It is a terrestrial orchid native to the Anatolian region of Turkey, characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and delicate, pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are often arranged in a loose raceme. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in open woodlands or meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
