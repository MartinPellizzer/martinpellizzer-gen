    "intro": "Opuntia sulphurea subsp. brachyacantha, commonly known as the yellow prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems that are often covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. This subspecies is well adapted to hot, dry environments and is often used in traditional medicine."
