    "intro": "Opuntia puelchana, commonly known as the Puelchana prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to southern South America. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia puelchana thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in regions with low rainfall."
