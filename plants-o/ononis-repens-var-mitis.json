    "intro": "Ononis repens var. mitis, commonly known as the soft sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes and dry, open habitats. The plant features small, pale green to reddish leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers from late spring to early summer. It is characterized by its creeping habit and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions. Its botanical structure supports its role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
