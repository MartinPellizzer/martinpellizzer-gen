    "intro": "Ocotea citrifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, orange-red fruits that are edible but have a strong, spicy flavor. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in many regions."
