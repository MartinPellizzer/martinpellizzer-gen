    "intro": "Oxyrhynchus alienus, commonly known as the moonlight fern, is a rare and enigmatic plant species characterized by its bioluminescent fronds. Native to the misty highlands of the Andes, it thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity. Its leaves emit a faint blue glow at night, a unique adaptation believed to aid in pollination by nocturnal insects. The plant has a complex root system that helps it absorb nutrients from nutrient-poor soils. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, Oxyrhynchus alienus is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of ongoing scientific study."
