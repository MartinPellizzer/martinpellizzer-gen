It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and fragrant, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are typically red or yellow when mature. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is also cultivated in horticulture."
