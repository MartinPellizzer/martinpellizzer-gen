    "intro": "Ophrys doerfleri, commonly known as the Doerfler's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a dark, bee-like labellum that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees. Ophrys doerfleri thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
