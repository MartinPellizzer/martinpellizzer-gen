    "intro": "Osyris speciosa, commonly known as the golden osier, is a deciduous shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a sprawling growth habit with multiple stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense thickets. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a smooth texture with a slightly serrated edge. Osyris speciosa is well adapted to arid conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
