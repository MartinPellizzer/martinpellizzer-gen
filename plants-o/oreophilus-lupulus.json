It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Oreophilus lupulus thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
