    "intro": "Orthophytum horridum, commonly known as the Brazilian fireplant, is a striking succulent native to Brazil. It features dense clusters of narrow, spiky leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. It is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique morphology and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
