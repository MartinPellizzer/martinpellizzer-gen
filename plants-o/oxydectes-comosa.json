It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and leaves, which give it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Oxydectes comosa is adapted to arid environments and is relatively drought-tolerant."
