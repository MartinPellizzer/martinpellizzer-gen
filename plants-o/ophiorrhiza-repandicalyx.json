    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza repandicalyx, commonly known as the white sand tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Ophiorrhiza repandicalyx is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky areas."
