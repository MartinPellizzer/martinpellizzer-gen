    "intro": "Oxystelma esculentum, commonly known as the edible nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by orange or red berries, which are edible when ripe. The leaves and stems are also consumed in some traditional cuisines, though they contain mild toxins that require careful preparation. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ethnobotanical studies."
