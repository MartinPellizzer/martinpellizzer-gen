    "intro": "Oryctanthus amazonicus, commonly known as the Amazonian burr flower, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, spiny seed pods that encase its small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the humid climate of the Amazon basin. Its flowers are usually pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Due to its habitat specificity, Oryctanthus amazonicus is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
