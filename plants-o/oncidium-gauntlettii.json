    "intro": "Oncidium gauntlettii, commonly known as the Gauntlett's orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features a slender, branched stem with numerous pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often arranged in racemes. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted for efficient light capture in its natural habitat. Oncidium gauntlettii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
