    "intro": "Ourisia sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaved ourisia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant has dark green, sessile (nearly stemless) leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers, which bloom in early spring, are typically pale yellow to white and are arranged in dense, terminal clusters. Ourisia sessilifolia thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
