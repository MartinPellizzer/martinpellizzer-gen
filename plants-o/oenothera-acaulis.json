    "intro": "Oenothera acaulis, commonly known as the stemless evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its lack of a distinct stem, with leaves directly attached to the base of the plant. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in sandy or dry soils and is often found in open habitats like prairies and disturbed areas. Oenothera acaulis is also known for its medicinal properties, with its seeds containing essential fatty acids."
