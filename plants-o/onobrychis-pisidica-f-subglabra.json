    "intro": "Onobrychis pisidica f. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth field vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features trifoliate leaves with smooth, glabrous surfaces, distinguishing it from other varieties of the species. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. Its hairy, trifoliate leaves are typically arranged alternately along the stems. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ecological restoration due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities."
