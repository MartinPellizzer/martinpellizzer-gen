    "intro": "Ononis antiquorum var. glanduliferum, commonly known as the glandular rock-cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, glaucous leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in sunny, well-drained habitats. Its stems are usually hairy and can produce secondary shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The species is noted for its ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments due to its succulent leaves and deep root system."
