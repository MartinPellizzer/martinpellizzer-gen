    "intro": "Ottelia luapulana, commonly known as the African water starwort, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in shallow water bodies such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has submerged and floating leaves, with the latter often forming a dense mat on the water surface. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in a spike-like inflorescence, and it produces small, dark seeds. Ottelia luapulana is adapted to wet environments and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms."
