    "intro": "Orchis coriophora f. borosiana, commonly known as the borosian narrow-leaved orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It is a perennial herb that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological dependence. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, this orchid is considered endangered in many regions."
