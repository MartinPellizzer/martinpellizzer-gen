    "intro": "Opuntia galapageia subsp. insularis, commonly known as the Gal\u00e1pagos prickly pear, is a cactus native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces edible fruits known as tunas, which are a significant food source for both wildlife and humans. It thrives in coastal and volcanic soils, adapting to the arid and variable climate of the islands. Its subspecific status highlights its unique evolutionary adaptations to the isolated environment of the Gal\u00e1pagos."
