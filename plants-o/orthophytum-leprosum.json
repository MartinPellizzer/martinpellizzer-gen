    "intro": "Orthophytum leprosum, commonly known as the Leprous Orthophytum, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in summer. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
