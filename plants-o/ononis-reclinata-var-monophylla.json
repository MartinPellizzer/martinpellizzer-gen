    "intro": "Ononis reclinata var. monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature. This variety is noted for its ability to thrive in sandy and gravelly soils, making it a common sight in coastal and rocky habitats."
