    "intro": "Orobanche grenieri, commonly known as the Mediterranean broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of the Mediterranean. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, branched stem. It typically parasitizes plants such as thistles and legumes. Due to its lack of leaves and photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem as a specialized parasite."
