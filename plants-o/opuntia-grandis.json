    "intro": "Opuntia grandis, commonly known as the giant prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, flat, paddle-shaped stems that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, fleshy fruits called tunas. Opuntia grandis is adapted to arid environments, with thick, waxy skin that reduces water loss. Its stems and flowers are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source in various cultures."
