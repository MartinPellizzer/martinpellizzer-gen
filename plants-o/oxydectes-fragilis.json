    "intro": "Oxydectes fragilis, commonly known as the brittle oxalis, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, bright yellow flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its fragility, it requires careful handling to avoid damage to its tender stems and leaves."
