    "intro": "Onosma simplex, commonly known as the simple onosma, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Boraginaceae. It is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are typically hairy and lance-shaped, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Onosma simplex is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in marginal environments."
