    "intro": "Ophrys omegaifera subsp. fleischmannii, commonly known as the Fleischmann's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
