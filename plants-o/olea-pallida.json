    "intro": "Olea pallida, commonly known as the pale olive, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its grayish-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by small, fleshy fruits. Olea pallida is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
