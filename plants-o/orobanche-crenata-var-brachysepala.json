    "intro": "Orobanche crenata var. brachysepala, commonly known as the short-sepaled broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its yellowish or reddish floral structures. The plant typically produces small, clustered flowers with bilateral symmetry, and its seeds are dispersed by wind or animals. It is often found in Mediterranean regions and can be a problematic weed in agricultural settings. Its parasitic nature makes it a challenge for crop management in affected areas."
