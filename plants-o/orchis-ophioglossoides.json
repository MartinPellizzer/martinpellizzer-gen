    "intro": "Orchis ophioglossoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, erect flowering stem that produces a spike of small, pale green to brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are often overlooked due to their modest appearance, but they play a role in attracting specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Orchis ophioglossoides is considered vulnerable in many regions."
