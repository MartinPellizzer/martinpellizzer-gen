It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silvery, fuzzy leaves. These plants are native to the Mediterranean region and are often found in coastal areas and rocky soils. Ophianthe species are typically herbaceous perennials, though some may have a woody base. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in sunny, well-drained conditions."
