    "intro": "Oxytropis retrorsa, commonly known as the backward oxytropis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically arranged in racemes. Oxytropis retrorsa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Its root system is deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it resilient to drought conditions."
