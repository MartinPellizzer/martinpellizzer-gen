    "intro": "Ononis reclinata f. inclusa, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, dry conditions and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
