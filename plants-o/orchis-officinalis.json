It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Its rhizome is used in traditional medicine for its purported tonic and aphrodisiac properties. Orchis officinalis is also an important nectar source for various pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
