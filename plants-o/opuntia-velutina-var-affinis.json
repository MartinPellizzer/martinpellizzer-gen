    "intro": "Opuntia velutina var. affinis, commonly known as the velvet cactus or desert spoon, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems covered in dense, soft spines that give it a velvety appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for both humans and animals. Its leaves are modified into spines, and its stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
