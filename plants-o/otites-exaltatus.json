    "intro": "Otites exaltatus, commonly known as the tall bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking blue to violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Otites exaltatus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring through early autumn."
