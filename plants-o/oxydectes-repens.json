    "intro": "Oxydectes repens, commonly known as the creeping oxydectes, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes and spread along the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Oxydectes repens is often found in moist, sandy soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
