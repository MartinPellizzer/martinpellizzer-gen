    "intro": "Ophiocaulon schweinfurthii, commonly known as the Schweinfurth's rock cactus, is a perennial cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
