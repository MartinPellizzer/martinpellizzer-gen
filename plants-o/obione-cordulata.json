    "intro": "Obione cordulata, commonly known as the slender feather fern, is a delicate perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features wiry, creeping rhizomes and produces slender, arching fronds that are typically 20\u201340 cm in length. The fronds are pinnately divided, with small, oblong pinnae that give the plant its characteristic feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
