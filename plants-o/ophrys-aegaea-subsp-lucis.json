    "intro": "Ophrys aegaea subsp. lucis, commonly known as the dawn orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a distinctive lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, aiding in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowering period occurs in early spring, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a strikingly colored lip. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
