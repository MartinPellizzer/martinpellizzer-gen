    "intro": "Oberonia odoardi, commonly known as the Odoardi's orchid, is a species of flowering plant in the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its slender, epiphytic growth habit, often found growing on trees or rocks in humid environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically displaying a mix of white and green hues with intricate patterns. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Oberonia odoardi is considered a rare and endangered species."
