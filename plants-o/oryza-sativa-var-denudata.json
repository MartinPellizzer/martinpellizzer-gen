    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. denudata, commonly known as the naked rice or wild rice, is a wild variety of rice native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its reduced or absent glumes, which give it a distinctive appearance compared to cultivated rice varieties. This plant typically grows in wetland environments and is adapted to flooded conditions. Its grains are smaller and less processed than those of domesticated rice, and it has been used traditionally in some regions for food and medicinal purposes. Botanically, it is closely related to the domesticated rice species and provides insights into the evolution of rice cultivation."
