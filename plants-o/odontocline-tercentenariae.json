    "intro": "Odontocline tercentenariae, commonly known as the three-century odontocline, is a rare and ancient plant species with a unique botanical structure. It features a robust, woody stem with a thick, fibrous bark that provides protection against environmental stressors. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by round, fleshy fruits. Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it is considered a living relic of prehistoric flora."
