    "intro": "Orobanchella coerulescens, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially depends on host plants for water and nutrients through its root system. Its leaves are opposite, linear, and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Orobanchella coerulescens thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as roadsides and prairies."
