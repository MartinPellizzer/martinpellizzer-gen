    "intro": "Ononis columnae f. enervia, commonly known as the slender bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features slender, ascending stems that are often leafless towards the apex, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming from May to July. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs. This variety is characterized by its reduced leaf structure, which distinguishes it from the typical form of Ononis columnae."
