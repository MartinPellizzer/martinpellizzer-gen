    "intro": "Oxycarpus gangetica, commonly known as the Indian lotus, is a aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink, red, and white, and its broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant has a deep root system that anchors it in muddy substrates, allowing it to thrive in still or slow-moving water bodies. Its flowers are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it produces distinctive, woody fruits that contain several seeds. Oxycarpus gangetica plays an important ecological role in water purification and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
