    "intro": "Ohigginsia mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican ohigginsia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically produces vibrant purple or red blooms, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve water in its native environment. Ohigginsia mexicana is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
