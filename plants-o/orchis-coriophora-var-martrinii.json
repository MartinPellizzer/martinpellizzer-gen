    "intro": "Orchis coriophora var. martrinii, commonly known as the Mart\u00edn's narrow-leaved orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific alpine and subalpine habitats. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale green to brownish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. It has a mycorrhizal association with fungi, which helps it absorb nutrients from the soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
