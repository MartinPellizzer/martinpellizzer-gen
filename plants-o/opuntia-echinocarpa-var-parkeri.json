    "intro": "Opuntia echinocarpa var. parkeri, commonly known as the Parker's prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, spine-tipped pads and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas, which are often used in local cuisines. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The variety is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more compact growth compared to the typical form of Opuntia echinocarpa."
