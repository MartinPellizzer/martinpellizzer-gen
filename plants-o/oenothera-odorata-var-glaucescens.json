    "intro": "Oenothera odorata var. glaucescens, commonly known as the blue-veined evening primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It features showy, yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening and close by morning. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating that gives them a bluish sheen. This variety is characterized by its pale blue or grayish-green foliage, which distinguishes it from other members of the Oenothera genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions."
