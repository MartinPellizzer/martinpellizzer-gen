    "intro": "Ophrys trollii var. virescens, commonly known as the green-tongued helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy flower with a distinctive greenish-yellow lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats and thrives in acidic soils. Its flowers are known for their intricate structure and ability to mimic female insects, a trait that aids in pollination. This orchid is relatively rare and is often protected due to habitat loss and over-collection."
