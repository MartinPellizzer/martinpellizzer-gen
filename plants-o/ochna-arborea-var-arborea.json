    "intro": "Ochna arborea var. arborea, commonly known as the African star apple, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical, glossy leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by distinctive, star-shaped fruits that turn from green to red as they mature. The fruits are edible, with a sweet, juicy pulp containing black seeds, and are often consumed fresh or used in traditional remedies. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks."
