It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellowish to white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its habitat. Oenosciadium anomalum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
