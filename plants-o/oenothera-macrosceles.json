It is characterized by its tall, branching stems and large, showy yellow flowers that open in the evening. The plant produces numerous seeds enclosed in a capsule, which is a common reproductive strategy among members of the Onagraceae family. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a hairy texture. Oenothera macrosceles is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
