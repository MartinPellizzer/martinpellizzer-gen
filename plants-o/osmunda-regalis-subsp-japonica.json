    "intro": "Osmunda regalis subsp. japonica, commonly known as the Japanese royal fern, is a perennial fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern life cycle. The plant's rhizomes are also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
