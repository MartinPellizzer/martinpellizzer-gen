    "intro": "Oenanthe kunzei, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water dropwort, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white or greenish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and damp woodlands. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to aquatic conditions. Oenanthe kunzei is often found in shallow water or along the edges of water bodies, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems."
