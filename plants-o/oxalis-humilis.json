    "intro": "Oxalis humilis, commonly known as the common wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with distinctive reddish veins, and small, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. It produces small, edible fruits that contain seeds, and it is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. Oxalis humilis is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and its historical use in traditional medicine."
