    "intro": "Odina fruticosa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and unique coloration. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by bright red or orange berries, which are edible for some wildlife but toxic to humans. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy texture, while its roots can be deep and extensive. Odina fruticosa plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing food and shelter for various species."
