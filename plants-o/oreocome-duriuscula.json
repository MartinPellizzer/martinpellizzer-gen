    "intro": "Oreocome duriuscula, commonly known as the hard-leaved oreocome, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps reduce water loss, and its flowers are usually small and yellow or orange in color. Oreocome duriuscula is often found in mountainous or coastal areas where it thrives in full sun."
