    "intro": "Ottelia crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved Ottelia, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are typically rounded or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often emerging from the water surface. Ottelia crassifolia thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its roots are often submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water."
