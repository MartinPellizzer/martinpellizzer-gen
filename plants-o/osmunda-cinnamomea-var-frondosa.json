    "intro": "Osmunda cinnamomea var. frondosa, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are often tinged with a reddish hue. It is native to moist, shady habitats in the eastern United States and parts of Canada. The plant has a distinctive, clustered rootstock with long, slender rhizomes that support its large, bipinnate fronds. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typically in rows along the veins. The fern thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
