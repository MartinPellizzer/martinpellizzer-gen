    "intro": "Onobrychis spinosissima, commonly known as the spiny bursary, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, pod-like fruits and trifoliate leaves, which are typically hairy and serrated. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a ornamental plant."
