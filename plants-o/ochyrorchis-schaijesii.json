    "intro": "Ochyrorchis schaijesii, commonly known as the Schaijes' orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to South Africa. It is a terrestrial orchid with a unique morphology, featuring a short, rhizomatous stem and a single, lance-shaped leaf. The plant produces a single, showy inflorescence with several small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. It thrives in specific microhabitats, often in rocky or sandy soils with high light exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
