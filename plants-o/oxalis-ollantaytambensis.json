    "intro": "Oxalis ollantaytambensis, commonly known as the Ollantaytambo wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of Peru. It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. It is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its delicate appearance. However, like many oxalis species, it contains oxalic acid and should be handled with care."
