    "intro": "Ossaea disparilis var. adenophora, commonly known as the\u817a\u82b1\u6c99\u68d8, is a variant of the sandmat plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and succulent leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control in degraded landscapes. The variety adenophora is distinguished by its glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, which contribute to its unique botanical appearance."
