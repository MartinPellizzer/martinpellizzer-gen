    "intro": "Orobanche dorycnii-suffruticosi, commonly known as the green broom weed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of legumes. This species is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in agricultural fields. Its flowers are usually yellow or green, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and is considered a weed in many regions."
