    "intro": "Oreomyrrhis taiwaniana, commonly known as the Taiwan orchid, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Taiwan. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountainous regions and forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps in reducing water loss. The flowers, which are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, are clustered in inflorescences and bloom during the spring and early summer."
