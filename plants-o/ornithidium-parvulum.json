    "intro": "Ornithidium parvulum, commonly known as the small bird's nest fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit, with fronds that resemble a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant has a short, underground rhizome that supports its upright, clustered fronds. Its leaves are typically dark green and leathery, with a distinctive curled appearance. Ornithidium parvulum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its unique appearance."
