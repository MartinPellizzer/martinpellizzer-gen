    "intro": "Oenanthe dielsii subsp. thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's water-dropwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in moist, rocky or alpine habitats, often found in stream banks and meadows. The plant features slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, adorned with alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbels, and bloom in late summer. This subspecies is characterized by its preference for cool, humid environments and is of interest to botanists due to its ecological and potentially medicinal significance."
