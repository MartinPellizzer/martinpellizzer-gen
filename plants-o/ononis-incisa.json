    "intro": "Ononis incisa, commonly known as narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features a mat-forming habit with slender, upright stems covered in small, white or pale pink flowers. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as coastal dunes or rocky slopes. The plant is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient member of its ecosystem."
