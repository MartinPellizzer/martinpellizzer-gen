    "intro": "Oberonia condensata, commonly known as the condensed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it can receive indirect light. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a dense spike, which is characteristic of the Oberonia genus. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor. This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
