    "intro": "Orobanche filicicola, commonly known as the fernleaf broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its dependence on host plants for survival. This species typically parasitizes members of the fern family, using specialized structures called haustoria to extract water and nutrients. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a distinctive appearance that varies depending on the host. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological systems, often thriving in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils."
