    "intro": "Onobrychis pindicola f. macroacantha, commonly known as the large-spined broom, is a rare and distinctive plant species characterized by its unique morphological features. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is native to specific regions of the Balkans, particularly in Greece and Albania. The plant is notable for its dense, thorny growth habit and its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being narrow and pointed, contributing to its overall appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
