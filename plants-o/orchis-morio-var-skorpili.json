    "intro": "Orchis morio var. skorpili, commonly known as the Skorpion orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to the Balkan region. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with a distinctive yellowish-green lip, which is a key feature for identification. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats, preferring well-drained soils. It is a perennial herb with a rhizomatous root system, and its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in some areas."
