    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 albertiana, commonly known as the Albertine bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Balkans. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure, which features a prominent lip that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and woodlands. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with dark markings, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Ophrys \u00d7 albertiana is valued for its unique morphology and ecological role in its native environment."
