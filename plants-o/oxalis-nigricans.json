    "intro": "Oxalis nigricans, commonly known as blackwood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves with dark green veins and small, delicate flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Oxalis nigricans thrives in moist, shaded environments and has a fibrous root system that helps it retain moisture. Its botanical characteristics make it a unique addition to native plant gardens and ecological studies."
