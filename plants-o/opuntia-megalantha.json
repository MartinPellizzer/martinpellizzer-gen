    "intro": "Opuntia megalantha, commonly known as the giant prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, flattened stems that are covered in sharp spines and are often ribbed. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Opuntia megalantha is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick, succulent stems. It is also known for its slow growth and ability to thrive in rocky or sandy soils."
