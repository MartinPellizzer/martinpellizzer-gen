    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 rainei, commonly known as the Raine's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate flower structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that plays a key role in the mimicry. Ophrys \u00d7 rainei is a rare and protected species, often found in specific microhabitats within its native range."
