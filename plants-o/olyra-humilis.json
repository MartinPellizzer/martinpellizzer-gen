    "intro": "Olyra humilis, commonly known as the dwarf lily of the Nile, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features strap-like, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Olyra humilis thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to reseed itself, ensuring a continuous display over time."
