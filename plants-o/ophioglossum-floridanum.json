    "intro": "Ophioglossum floridanum, commonly known as the Florida adder's mouth, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, tongue-shaped sporangia that are clustered at the end of a single, unbranched frond. The plant exhibits a primitive reproductive system, with spores produced in specialized structures rather than flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and elongated, with a distinctive, glossy appearance. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
