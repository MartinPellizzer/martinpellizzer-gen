It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe, particularly the British Isles. The plant produces tall, erect stems with lance-shaped leaves and clusters of violet or purple flowers. Its flowers are typically spurred at the base, a characteristic feature of many orchid species. Orchis \u00d7 rombucina is often found in damp meadows and woodland edges, thriving in partially shaded environments."
