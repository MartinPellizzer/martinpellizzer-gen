    "intro": "Ophioglossum reticulatum f. dilatatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species characterized by its unique morphology. It features a short, fleshy rhizome and a single, large, lance-shaped leaf with a distinctive, tongue-like spore-producing structure at the base. The leaf is typically broad and has a reticulated pattern on its surface, giving it a textured appearance. It produces sporangia in a specialized, club-shaped structure called a sporangium, which is positioned at the base of the leaf. This fern is often found in moist, shaded environments and is considered a relic from the Paleozoic era."
