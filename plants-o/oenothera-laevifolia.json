    "intro": "Oenothera laevifolia, commonly known as the smooth evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite leaves that are smooth and lance-shaped. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its flowers are followed by capsule fruits that release seeds when mature. Oenothera laevifolia is often found in open woods, meadows, and along stream banks, thriving in well-drained soils."
