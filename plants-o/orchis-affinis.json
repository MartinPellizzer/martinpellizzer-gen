    "intro": "Orchis affinis, commonly known as the common twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, showy purple or pinkish flower. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake. Orchis affinis is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism, attracting specific insects for reproduction."
