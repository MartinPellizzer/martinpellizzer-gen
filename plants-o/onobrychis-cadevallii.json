    "intro": "Onobrychis cadevallii, commonly known as the Cadevall's goat's rue, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
