    "intro": "Ophrys cornuta var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, bee-like floral structure, which features a prominent, hairy lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its mimicry. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
