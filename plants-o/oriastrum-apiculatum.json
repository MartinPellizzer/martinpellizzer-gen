    "intro": "Oriastrum apiculatum, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky areas. The plant features a basal rosette of fleshy, lobed leaves that help it conserve water. Its showy yellow flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Oriastrum apiculatum is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in harsh desert conditions."
