    "intro": "Otoglossum schultesii, commonly known as the Schultesi's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, pendulous flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are usually broad and strap-like, and the flowers are often fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Otoglossum schultesii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or shaded gardens."
