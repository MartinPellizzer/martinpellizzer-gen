    "intro": "Ornithogalum balansae, commonly known as the Balansae star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial bulbous plant native to South Africa. It produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to grow in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. However, it can be invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
