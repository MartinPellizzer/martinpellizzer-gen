    "intro": "Ophrys cornuta var. banatica, commonly known as the Banat horned orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Southeast Europe. It is characterized by its unique, bee-like flower structure, which features a prominent central spur and intricate markings that mimic the appearance of a female bee. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in forested or semi-shaded habitats. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a delicate, pale yellow to greenish coloration. Due to its specific ecological requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
