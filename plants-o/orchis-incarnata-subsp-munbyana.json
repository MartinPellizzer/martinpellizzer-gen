    "intro": "Orchis incarnata subsp. munbyana, commonly known as the pink fairy orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. The plant produces striking pink to purple flowers in early summer, which are arranged in dense spikes. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. This subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Orchis incarnata."
