It is characterized by its delicate, ribbon-like fronds that are typically submerged in shallow coastal waters. The plant thrives in brackish to marine environments, often found in estuaries and tidal zones. Its structure consists of a rhizome with branching, blade-like leaves that aid in photosynthesis. Oceaniopteris whelanii plays a vital role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various marine organisms."
