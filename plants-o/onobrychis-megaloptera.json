    "intro": "Onobrychis megaloptera, commonly known as the large-winged bur clover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive, inflated pods that contain several seeds. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
