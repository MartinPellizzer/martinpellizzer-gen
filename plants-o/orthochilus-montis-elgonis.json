    "intro": "Orthochilus montis-elgonis, commonly known as the Elgon mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the high-altitude regions of Mount Elgon in East Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and specialized growth habits. The plant typically grows in rocky crevices and shaded forest areas, thriving in cool and moist microclimates. Its flowers are usually small and pale greenish-white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a conservation concern."
