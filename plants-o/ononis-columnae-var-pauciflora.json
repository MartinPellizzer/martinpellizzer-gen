    "intro": "Ononis columnae var. pauciflora, commonly known as the slender whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters along the stem, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
