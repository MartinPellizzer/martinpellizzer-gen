    "intro": "Orchis picta var. caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian painted orchid, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and produces tall, slender stems bearing showy, violet-blue flowers with intricate patterns. The plant is characterized by its unique floral morphology, including a spurred lip and a distinctive coloration that aids in pollination. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in association with other orchid species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
