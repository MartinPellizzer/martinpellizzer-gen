    "intro": "Opuntia roborensis, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems called cladodes. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which are followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia roborensis is well adapted to arid environments, with spines that help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
