    "intro": "Onoclea pensylvatica, commonly known as the eastern brittle bladderwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant found in wetlands and marshes across eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its reproductive strategy involves both sexual reproduction through flowers and asexual reproduction via vegetative propagation. The plant plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
