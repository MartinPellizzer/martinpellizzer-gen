It is characterized by its large, broad, and leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
