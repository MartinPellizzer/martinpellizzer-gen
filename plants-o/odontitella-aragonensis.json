    "intro": "Odontitella aragonensis, commonly known as the Aragonese tooth plant, is a rare and endemic species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its fern-like leaves and umbellate inflorescence. The plant is distinguished by its unique, tooth-like structures on its stems, which give it its scientific name. It thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
