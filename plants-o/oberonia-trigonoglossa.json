    "intro": "Oberonia trigonoglossa, commonly known as the triangular tongue orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, triangular-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with reddish-brown markings. The plant grows on trees or rocks, and its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests."
