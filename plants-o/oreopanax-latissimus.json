    "intro": "Oreopanax latissimus, commonly known as the broad-leafed oreopanax, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, and often leathery leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant typically grows as an understory species in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests. Its stems are woody and often have a somewhat succulent appearance, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. The leaves are usually arranged alternately along the stem and can exhibit a distinctive veining pattern."
