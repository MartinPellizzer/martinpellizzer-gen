    "intro": "Oreodaphne rigens var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved oreodaphne, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and lanceolate, glossy leaves. The leaves are typically smaller than those of the typical variety, hence the name \"parvifolia,\" which means \"small leaf.\" It produces small, clustered yellow flowers followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. This plant is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental qualities and potential medicinal uses."
