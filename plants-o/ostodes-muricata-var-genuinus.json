    "intro": "Ostodes muricata var. genuinus, commonly known as the velvetleaf hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features large, velvety leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming from summer to autumn. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous seeds, aiding in its propagation. The plant is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking foliage and vibrant floral display."
