    "intro": "Opuntia gymnocarpa, commonly known as the smooth spineless prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy pads that are covered in small, soft spines rather than the more prominent ones found in other Opuntia species. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments. Opuntia gymnocarpa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
