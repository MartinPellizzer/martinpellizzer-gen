    "intro": "Oberonia manipurensis, commonly known as the Manipur orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the northeastern region of India. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the undergrowth of tropical forests. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from decaying organic matter in the forest floor. Due to habitat loss, Oberonia manipurensis is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
