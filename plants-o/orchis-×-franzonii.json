    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 franzonii, commonly known as the Franzoni's orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis anthropophora. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, adorned with numerous showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing intricate, spurred orchid flowers that are highly attractive to pollinators. It prefers moist, shaded woodland habitats and is often found in temperate regions of Europe. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
