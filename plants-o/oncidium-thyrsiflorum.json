    "intro": "Oncidium thyrsiflorum, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences that bear numerous fragrant, yellow flowers with a distinctive butterfly-like shape. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Oncidium thyrsiflorum requires bright, indirect light and well-draining potting media to thrive."
