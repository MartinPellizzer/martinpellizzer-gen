It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in spines and are used for photosynthesis. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, typically in the spring or early summer. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and has a sweet, succulent texture. Opuntia conjungens is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food."
