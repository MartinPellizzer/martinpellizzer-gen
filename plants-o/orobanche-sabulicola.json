    "intro": "Orobanche sabulicola, commonly known as the sand dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish-orange, thread-like stems that twine around its host. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to their lack of showy petals. It typically parasitizes members of the Fabaceae family, such as legumes, and is found in arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem as a parasite with limited ecological impact on its hosts."
