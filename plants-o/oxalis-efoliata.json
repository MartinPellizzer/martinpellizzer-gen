    "intro": "Oxalis efoliata, commonly known as the leafy wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It features trifoliate leaves with three heart-shaped leaflets, often adorned with fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by distinctive red, three-lobed seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and unique floral structure."
