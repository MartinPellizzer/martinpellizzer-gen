    "intro": "Ornithidium purpureolabium, commonly known as the purple-labied orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet and white flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of rainforests. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
