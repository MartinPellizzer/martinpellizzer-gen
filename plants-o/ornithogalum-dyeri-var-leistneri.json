    "intro": "Ornithogalum dyeri var. leistneri, commonly known as the Leistner's star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features strap-like, linear leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in spring. The plant is characterized by its bulbous root system, which stores nutrients and water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. It is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. This variant is noted for its ornamental value and is cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance."
