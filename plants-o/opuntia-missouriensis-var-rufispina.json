    "intro": "Opuntia missouriensis var. rufispina, commonly known as the Missouri prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the central United States. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems, which are covered in sharp spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This variety is notable for its distinctive reddish-brown spines, which set it apart from other Opuntia species."
