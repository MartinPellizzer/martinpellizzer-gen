    "intro": "Oxytropis huteri, commonly known as Huter's milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The plant is characterized by its erect stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. It is well adapted to dry environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Oxytropis huteri plays a role in stabilizing soil and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
