    "intro": "Omalocarpus macrophyllus, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, which float on the water's surface. The plant has a distinctive inflorescence with showy white flowers that open at night, attracting pollinators such as bats and insects. Its roots are submerged, anchoring the plant in shallow waters while absorbing nutrients from the sediment. The leaves are thick and waxy, providing buoyancy and protection against herbivores."
