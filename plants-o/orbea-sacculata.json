    "intro": "Orbea sacculata, commonly known as the African ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the summer months. Its root system is shallow, allowing it to quickly absorb moisture after rain. Orbea sacculata is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
