    "intro": "Oreobroma minimum, commonly known as the dwarf oreobroma, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils in open woodlands and along stream banks. The plant features a low-growing rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale blue to violet flowers in late spring. Its compact size and unique flowering habit make it an attractive addition to native plant gardens. Oreobroma minimum is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife."
