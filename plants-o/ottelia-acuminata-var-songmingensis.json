    "intro": "Ottelia acuminata var. songmingensis, commonly known as the Songming water plant, is a rare aquatic plant native to China. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, ovate leaves that are typically submerged or floating. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface, making it visually distinct. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments with ample sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
