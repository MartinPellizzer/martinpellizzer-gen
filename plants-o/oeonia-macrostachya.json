    "intro": "Oeonia macrostachya, commonly known as the large-stemmed marshweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the northeastern United States. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, often growing in dense clusters. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers arranged in clusters at the top of the stems, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Oeonia macrostachya plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
