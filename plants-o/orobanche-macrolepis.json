    "intro": "Orobanche macrolepis, commonly known as the large-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, often hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that are typically arranged in clusters. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and can parasitize a variety of host plants, including those in the legume and grass families. Due to its lack of photosynthesis, it plays a unique role in ecological systems as a parasite."
