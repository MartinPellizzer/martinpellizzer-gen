    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 altobracensis, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a natural hybrid between Orchis morio and Orchis anthropophora. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive lip that is often darker in hue. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil in its native environment. This species is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique genetic composition and ornamental value."
