It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are small, hair-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-drained soil and full sun. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of food and traditional medicine."
