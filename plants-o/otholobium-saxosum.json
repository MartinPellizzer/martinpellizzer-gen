    "intro": "Otholobium saxosum, commonly known as the rock everlasting, is a hardy, low-growing shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of tiny, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, often found on sandstone outcrops and mountain slopes. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Otholobium saxosum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soils."
