    "intro": "Ononis cintrana var. zaiana, commonly known as the Zaian rockcress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, typically found in rocky and limestone soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring season, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are basal, oblanceolate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This variety is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
