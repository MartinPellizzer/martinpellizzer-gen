    "intro": "Oryctanthus guianensis, commonly known as the Guianan sandthorn, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in regions of Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often followed by orange or red berries containing seeds. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, and the plant has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Oryctanthus guianensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local communities."
