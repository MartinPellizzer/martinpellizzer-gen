    "intro": "Ossaea neurotricha, commonly known as the coastal sandplant, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Ossaea neurotricha plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
