    "intro": "Opuntia microdasys var. albispina, commonly known as the white-spined prickly pear, is a cacti species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are often covered in white spines, distinguishing it from other Opuntia varieties. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to poor soil conditions. This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance."
