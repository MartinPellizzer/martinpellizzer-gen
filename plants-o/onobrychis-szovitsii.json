It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and forage production."
