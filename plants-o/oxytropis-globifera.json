    "intro": "Oxytropis globifera, commonly known as the globeflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its spherical, inflated seed pods that resemble small globes. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid soils and has small, compound leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pale blue or purple and bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to its harsh habitat. Oxytropis globifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
