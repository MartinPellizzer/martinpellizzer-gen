    "intro": "Oreogrammitis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of small, epiphytic ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. These plants are typically found growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. They have delicate, feather-like fronds that are often clustered together, forming a dense, mat-like structure. Oreogrammitis species are characterized by their simple, usually unbranched rhizomes and small, lance-shaped leaves. Their ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments makes them an important component of forest ecosystems."
