    "intro": "Orchis bicornis, commonly known as the two-horned orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to parts of Europe and is characterized by its distinctive two-lobed flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant produces a single, tall flowering stem that can reach up to 60 cm in height, with lance-shaped leaves arranged along the stem. Orchis bicornis thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its unique floral structure and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
