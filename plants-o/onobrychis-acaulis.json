    "intro": "Onobrychis acaulis, commonly known as the creeping vetch, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in shades of pink or purple. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its trifoliate leaves are simple and heart-shaped, with a hairy texture. Onobrychis acaulis is often found in dry, rocky soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
