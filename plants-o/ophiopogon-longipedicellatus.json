    "intro": "Ophiopogon longipedicellatus, commonly known as the long pedicellate spathiphyllum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces striking, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest floors. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Ophiopogon longipedicellatus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
