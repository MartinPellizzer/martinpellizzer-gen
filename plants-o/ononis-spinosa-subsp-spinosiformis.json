    "intro": "Ononis spinosa subsp. spinosiformis, commonly known as the spiny whitlow grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has small, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, dry fruits known as caryopses. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. This subspecies is distinguished by its more spiny and robust growth compared to other members of the Ononis genus."
