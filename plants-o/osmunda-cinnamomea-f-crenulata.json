    "intro": "Osmunda cinnamomea f. crenulata, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds that resemble a cinnamon stick. It is native to North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a robust rhizome system that supports its growth and helps it spread vegetatively. Its fronds are divided into a central sterile axis and fertile segments that produce spores. The crenulate form of its fronds gives it a unique appearance compared to other fern species."
