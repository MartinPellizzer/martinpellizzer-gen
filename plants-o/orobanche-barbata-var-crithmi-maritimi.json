    "intro": "Orobanche barbata var. crithmi-maritimi, commonly known as the sea orobanche, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is typically found in coastal areas and sandy soils, where it attaches to the roots of other plants such as grasses and legumes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in spikes, and it blooms during the summer months. Its life cycle is closely tied to the availability of suitable host species and environmental conditions. Due to its specialized parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in coastal ecosystems."
