    "intro": "Ornithidium bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is characterized by its distinctive two-toned flowers, which range from green to yellow and red. The plant has a slender, wiry stem and produces a single spike of small, clustered flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Ornithidium bicolor is a rare and endangered species, requiring specific environmental conditions for successful growth and reproduction."
