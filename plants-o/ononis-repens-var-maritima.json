    "intro": "Ononis repens var. maritima, commonly known as sea sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. This variety is adapted to sandy and saline soils, making it a hardy species found along shorelines and dunes. Its root system helps stabilize sand dunes, preventing erosion. The plant is also noted for its ability to tolerate salt spray and frequent exposure to wind."
