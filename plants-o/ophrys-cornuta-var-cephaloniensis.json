    "intro": "Ophrys cornuta var. cephaloniensis, commonly known as the Cephalonia bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the island of Cephalonia in Greece. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in Mediterranean climates with mild, wet winters. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown, with intricate patterns that enhance the mimicry. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
