    "intro": "Orthilia secunda subsp. obtusata, commonly known as the broad-leaved water starwort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands. The plant features floating or submerged leaves that are broad and rounded, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually clustered in spikes and bloom in early summer. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and fish."
