    "intro": "Oroya subocculta var. laxiareolata, commonly known as the slender oroya, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. The flowers bloom in late summer, producing a soft yellow color that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
