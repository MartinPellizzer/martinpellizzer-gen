    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia subsp. elata, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, showy purple or violet flower spike. This subspecies is typically found in moist, calcareous habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant has a short-lived root system and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. It blooms from late spring to early summer, contributing to the biodiversity of its native European habitats."
