    "intro": "Orobanche alsatica subsp. libanotidis, commonly known as the Lebanese broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or reddish, often branched stems. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color. It is native to regions of the Mediterranean, including parts of Lebanon, Syria, and Turkey. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth of its host plants, making it both ecologically and agriculturally significant."
