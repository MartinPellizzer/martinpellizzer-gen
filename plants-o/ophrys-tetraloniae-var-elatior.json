    "intro": "Ophrys tetraloniae var. elatior, commonly known as the greater bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces striking, bee-like flowers with a dark brownish-purple coloration and fine, hair-like structures that enhance its mimicry. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
