    "intro": "Opuntia acanthocarpa var. major, commonly known as the giant prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, flat, spine-tipped pads that can grow up to 30 inches in length. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Its thick, succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant is also noted for its ability to tolerate extreme temperatures and poor soil conditions."
