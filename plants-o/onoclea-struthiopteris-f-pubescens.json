    "intro": "Onoclea struthiopteris f. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent sword fern, is a variant of the common sword fern, characterized by its hairy, pubescent fronds. This fern belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to eastern North America. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive upright, sword-like shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The pubescent texture of its fronds distinguishes this form from the typical variety, making it a notable botanical variant."
