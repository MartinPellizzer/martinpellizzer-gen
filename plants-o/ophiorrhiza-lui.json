    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza lui, commonly known as the Indian white mangrove, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and opposite, elliptical leaves that are usually bright green. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by capsule fruits containing minute seeds. It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often growing in mangrove swamps and tidal mudflats. Ophiorrhiza lui plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
