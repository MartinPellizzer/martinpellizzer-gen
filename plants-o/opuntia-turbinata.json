    "intro": "Opuntia turbinata, commonly known as the Turban Cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia turbinata is a succulent plant with thick, water-storing stems that help it survive in arid environments. It is also noted for its spiny areoles, which bear clusters of glochids and flowers."
