It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in spring. The plant belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its underground bulb, which stores nutrients for growth. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
