    "intro": "Ornitrophe mollis, commonly known as the soft-feathered orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the humid rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and large, velvety leaves that are covered in a fine, soft pubescence. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming during the wet season. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the rich, organic soil. Due to habitat loss, Ornitrophe mollis is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
