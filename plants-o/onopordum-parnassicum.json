    "intro": "Onopordum parnassicum, commonly known as the Parnassian thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, silvery-green, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is cultivated in some gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
