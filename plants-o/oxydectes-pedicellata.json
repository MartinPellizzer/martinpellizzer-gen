    "intro": "Oxydectes pedicellata, commonly known as the creeping marshplant, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with thin, wiry stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight sheen, and are adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils. Oxydectes pedicellata plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
