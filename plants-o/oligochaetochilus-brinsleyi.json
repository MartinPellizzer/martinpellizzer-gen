    "intro": "Oligochaetochilus brinsleyi, commonly known as the Brinsley's filmy fern, is a rare and delicate species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, translucent fronds that resemble delicate lace, often growing in shaded, humid environments. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, typically on rock surfaces or in moist, shaded forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are small and clustered, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems."
