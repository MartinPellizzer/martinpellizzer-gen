    "intro": "Oenothera arenaria, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a low-growing perennial with slender, often branched stems and small, showy yellow or orange flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or coastal environments. Its flowers open in the evening and emit a mild scent, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Oenothera arenaria is also known for its ability to colonize disturbed areas and is considered a characteristic species of dunes and coastal plains."
