    "intro": "Orchis hispida, commonly known as the hairy orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help it thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces showy, violet or purple flowers in late spring to early summer. Orchis hispida is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in woodlands and meadows. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
