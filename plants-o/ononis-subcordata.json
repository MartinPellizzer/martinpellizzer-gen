    "intro": "Ononis subcordata, commonly known as the small heartleaf sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fleshy, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Ononis subcordata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
