    "intro": "Orobanche picridis, commonly known as the yellow witchweed, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has a taproot system that attaches to the roots of its host. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth of its host, often causing significant stress to the host plant. Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
