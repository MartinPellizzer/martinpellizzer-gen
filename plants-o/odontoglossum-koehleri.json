    "intro": "Odontoglossum koehleri, commonly known as the Koehleri orchid, is a species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces upright, lance-shaped leaves and bears small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and green. It thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade, requiring well-drained soil. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or protected environments."
