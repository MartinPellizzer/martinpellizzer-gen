    "intro": "Onychosepalum microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited claw-sepal plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its small, capsule-like fruits and distinctive claw-shaped sepals. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. The leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its ecological adaptation in humid environments."
