It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped lobes and produces clusters of small, violet or pinkish flowers. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense mats. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
