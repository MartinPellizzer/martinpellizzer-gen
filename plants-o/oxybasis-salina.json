    "intro": "Oxybasis salina, commonly known as saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. The plant is highly tolerant of saline soils and can thrive in environments with high salt concentrations. It produces small, greenish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Oxybasis salina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
