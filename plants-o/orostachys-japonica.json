    "intro": "Orostachys japonica, commonly known as the Japanese stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped growth pattern and fleshy, bluish-gray leaves that store water. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Orostachys japonica is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in arid and semi-arid climates."
