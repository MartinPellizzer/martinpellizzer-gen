    "intro": "Oncosporum villosum, commonly known as hairy oncosporum, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots and rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in shaded, wet areas. Oncosporum villosum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
