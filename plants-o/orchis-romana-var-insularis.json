    "intro": "Orchis romana var. insularis, commonly known as the Mediterranean orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the Mediterranean region. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, slender stem and showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in sunny, well-drained soils, often in rocky or coastal areas. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
