    "intro": "Onobrychis tournefortii, commonly known as French broom, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural or natural areas."
