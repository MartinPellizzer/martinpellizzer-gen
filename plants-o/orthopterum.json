These plants are characterized by their showy, yellow or golden-colored inflorescences that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Orthopterum species are native to various regions of Europe, Asia, and North America, often thriving in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. They are typically herbaceous perennials with alternate, lance-shaped leaves. The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
