It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, red flowers. The plant produces distinctive orange-yellow fruits that contain seeds covered in a fleshy, sticky coating. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some horticultural settings, though it is not widely commercially available."
