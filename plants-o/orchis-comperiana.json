    "intro": "Orchis comperiana, commonly known as the Comper's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to southern Europe. It is a terrestrial herb with a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces a single spike of showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive lip that attracts pollinators. It blooms in late spring to early summer, and its growth is often associated with calcareous grasslands. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
