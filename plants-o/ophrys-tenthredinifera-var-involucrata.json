    "intro": "Ophrys tenthredinifera var. involucrata, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance of female bees to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and open habitats. Its floral structure includes a labellum that serves as a landing platform for pollinators. The variety involucrata is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and slightly different floral morphology compared to the typical form."
