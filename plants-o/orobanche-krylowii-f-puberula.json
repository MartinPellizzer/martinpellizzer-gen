    "intro": "Orobanche krylowii f. puberula, commonly known as the pubescent broomrape, is a hemiparasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, often hairy stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It is native to regions of Central Asia and is often found growing on the roots of various herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species."
