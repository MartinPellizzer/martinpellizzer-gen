    "intro": "Ophelia pulchella var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf water plant, is a aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, arrow-shaped leaves that are usually green and glossy. It produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is smaller than the typical Ophelia pulchella, making it well-suited for smaller water gardens and pond landscapes."
