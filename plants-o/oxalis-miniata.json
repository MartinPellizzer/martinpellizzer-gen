    "intro": "Oxalis miniata, commonly known as the miniature wood sorrel, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that resemble those of true sorrels, with each leaflet having a waxy, glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a yellowish center. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Oxalis miniata is noted for its ornamental value and ability to spread via rhizomes, forming dense mats in suitable conditions."
