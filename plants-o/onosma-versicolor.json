    "intro": "Onosma versicolor, commonly known as the variable flowering plant, is a member of the Boraginaceae family. It is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the Tibetan Plateau. The plant is characterized by its blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, and its hairy, glandular leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercialized."
