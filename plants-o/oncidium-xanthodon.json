    "intro": "Oncidium xanthodon, commonly known as the yellow-bellied orchid, is a hybrid orchid species that exhibits a range of botanical characteristics. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in warm, humid environments. The plant features elongated, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive golden throat. Oncidium xanthodon is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and requires well-draining potting media. Its flowers are often used in floral arrangements due to their vibrant color and long-lasting bloom."
