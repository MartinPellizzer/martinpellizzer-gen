It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, linear leaves arranged in clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, and it thrives in moist, shady environments. Ortegioides decussata is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
