    "intro": "Oedochloa camporum, commonly known as buffelgrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Buffelgrass is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common species in regions with low rainfall. It is often used for forage and soil stabilization due to its hardy nature and rapid growth."
