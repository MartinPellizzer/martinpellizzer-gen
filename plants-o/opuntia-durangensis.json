It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and are often ribbed. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers, which are followed by edible, fleshy fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soil conditions. Opuntia durangensis is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of food in local communities."
