    "intro": "Oyedaea rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leafed shrub, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its rounded, leathery leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in shrubland habitats and is adapted to dry, well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and horticultural interest. However, it is not widely cultivated due to its specific environmental requirements."
