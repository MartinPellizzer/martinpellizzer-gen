    "intro": "Orchis satyrioides f. longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, featuring a single, showy orchid flower with a prominent lip and a narrow, elongated spur. The plant typically grows in woodland or grassland habitats, preferring moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its unique botanical appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
