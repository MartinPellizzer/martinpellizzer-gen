    "intro": "Opuntia hieronymi, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia hieronymi is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick, succulent stems. It plays an important role in both ecological and cultural contexts in its native habitat."
