    "intro": "Ochna collina, commonly known as the African butter tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the fruits are dispersed by birds and mammals. Ochna collina is valued for its ornamental appearance and has traditional uses in local medicine."
