    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 arachnitiformis subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as the Western bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive bee-like flower structure, which mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. The subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and ecological role in supporting pollinator populations."
