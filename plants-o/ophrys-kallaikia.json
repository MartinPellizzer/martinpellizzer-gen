    "intro": "Ophrys kallaikia, commonly known as the Kallaike bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Balkan region. It is characterized by its unique flower structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodland or rocky habitats. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a striking yellow and brown coloration. Due to its specialized pollination mechanism and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
