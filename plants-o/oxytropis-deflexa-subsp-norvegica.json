    "intro": "Oxytropis deflexa subsp. norvegica, commonly known as Norwegian milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the cold regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This species is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for certain livestock."
