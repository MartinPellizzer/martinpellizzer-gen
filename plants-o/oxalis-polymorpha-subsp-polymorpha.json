It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and produces clusters of yellow flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in spring, and it is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes. The plant has edible leaves and flowers, though they should be consumed in moderation due to their oxalic acid content."
