    "intro": "Ophrys willingii, commonly known as the Willing's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-mimicking flowers that have a distinctive yellow and brown pattern resembling a bee's body. The plant typically grows in rocky or woodland habitats and prefers well-drained soils. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a strong, sweet scent. Ophrys willingii is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism, which relies on mimicry to attract male bees for pollination."
