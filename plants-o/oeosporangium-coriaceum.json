    "intro": "Oeosporangium coriaceum, commonly known as the leather sporangium, is a unique plant characterized by its thick, leathery sporangia. This species belongs to the group of plants known as bryophytes, specifically liverworts, and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The sporangia are embedded in a tough, protective layer that aids in the retention of spores. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having structures called thallus that absorb water and nutrients directly. Its reproductive structures are adapted for dispersal in humid conditions, making it a significant component of forest floor ecosystems."
