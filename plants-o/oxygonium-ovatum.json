    "intro": "Oxygonium ovatum, commonly known as the water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has broad, waxy, light green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern on the water surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water, and it can spread rapidly through vegetative reproduction. Oxygonium ovatum is often found in slow-moving or still freshwater bodies, where it can form dense mats."
