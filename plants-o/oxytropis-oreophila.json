    "intro": "Oxytropis oreophila, commonly known as the alpine milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, and its leaves are pinnately compound, often covered in fine hairs. Oxytropis oreophila is adapted to cold, dry conditions and has a deep root system to access moisture in nutrient-poor soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
