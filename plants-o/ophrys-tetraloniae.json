    "intro": "Ophrys tetraloniae, commonly known as the four-lobed bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive labellum that plays a crucial role in its deceptive pollination strategy. Ophrys tetraloniae thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
