    "intro": "Ophrys aranifera var. tommasinii, commonly known as the Tommasin's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy flower with intricate patterns and a hairy, bee-like appearance. It thrives in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
