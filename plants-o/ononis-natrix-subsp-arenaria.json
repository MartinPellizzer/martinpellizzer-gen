    "intro": "Ononis natrix subsp. arenaria, commonly known as sand everlasting, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and sandy environments. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale pink. The plant has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are typically small and hairy, which reduces water loss through transpiration. It is often found in coastal dunes, gravelly plains, and other dry habitats across Europe and parts of North Africa."
