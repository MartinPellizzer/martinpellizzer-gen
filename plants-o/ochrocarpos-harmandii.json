    "intro": "Ochrocarpos harmandii, commonly known as the Harmand's rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb with a low-growing, mat-forming structure, typically found in rocky and arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to conserve water in its harsh habitat. Ochrocarpos harmandii is valued for its resilience and is often used in ecological restoration projects in semi-arid regions."
