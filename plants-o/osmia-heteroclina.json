    "intro": "Osmia heteroclina, commonly known as the slender mason bee, is a solitary bee species belonging to the family Megachilidae. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, where it typically inhabits temperate climates. The plant-associated aspect of this bee is its preference for flowering plants that provide nectar and pollen, such as dandelions, clover, and various grasses. Osmia heteroclina plays a vital role in pollination, contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat. Its nesting behavior involves constructing small, papery nests in hollow stems or artificial structures, which is a key aspect of its botanical interaction with its environment."
