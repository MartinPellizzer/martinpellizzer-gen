    "intro": "Orobanche ramosa var. mutelii, commonly known as the pale broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its branched, yellowish stems and small, scale-like leaves. This species typically infests the roots of various host plants, including legumes and some grasses, in arid and semi-arid environments. Its flowers are usually pale pink or white, and it produces small, dry fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
