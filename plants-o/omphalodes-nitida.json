    "intro": "Omphalodes nitida, commonly known as slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to dry, sandy soils in the Mediterranean region. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, arid conditions. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems, and it is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Omphalodes nitida is valued in horticulture for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its ornamental appeal."
