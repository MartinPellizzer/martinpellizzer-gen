It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are often tinged with pink or red. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to harsh environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
