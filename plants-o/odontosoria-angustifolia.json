    "intro": "Odontosoria angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in small, circular structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Odontosoria angustifolia is a perennial plant with a rhizomatous growth habit, contributing to its ability to spread and establish in suitable habitats."
