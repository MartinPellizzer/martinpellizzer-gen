    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 azurea, commonly known as the Azure Bee Orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera (the Bee Orchid) and Ophrys scaposa. It is characterized by its strikingly intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or meadow habitats across Europe. Its flowers are usually pale blue to violet in color, with a distinctive golden beard-like marking on the lip. Ophrys \u00d7 azurea is a short-lived perennial, often appearing in the wild as a result of natural hybridization between its parent species."
