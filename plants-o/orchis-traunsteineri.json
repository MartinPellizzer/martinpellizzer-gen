    "intro": "Orchis traunsteineri, commonly known as the Traunsteiner's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and striking violet-blue flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing a single spike with several showy, lip-like petals. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it thrives in moist, calcareous soils. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its native range."
