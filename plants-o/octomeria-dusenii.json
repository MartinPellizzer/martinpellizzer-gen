    "intro": "Octomeria dusenii, commonly known as the Dusen's octomeria, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern China. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are usually opposite and elliptical, with a slightly hairy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
