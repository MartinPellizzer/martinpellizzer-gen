    "intro": "Oberonia wynadensis, commonly known as the Wynad orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, often with a faintly fragrant scent. It thrives in moist, shaded forest environments and is adapted to the humid climate of its native region. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
