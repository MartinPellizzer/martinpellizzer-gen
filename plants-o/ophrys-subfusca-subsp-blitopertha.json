    "intro": "Ophrys subfusca subsp. blitopertha, commonly known as the Balkan bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and meadows, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are usually a mix of brown and yellow hues, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
