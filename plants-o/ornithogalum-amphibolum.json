It is characterized by its striking white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. The plant has strap-shaped leaves and produces small, fleshy berries that contain toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care."
