    "intro": "Oritrophium vahlii, commonly known as the desert hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and can thrive in harsh environmental conditions due to its deep root system. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss. Oritrophium vahlii produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting various pollinators."
