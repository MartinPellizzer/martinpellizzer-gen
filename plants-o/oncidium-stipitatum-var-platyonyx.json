It features vibrant, long-lasting flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with contrasting red or brown markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical, and the leaves are strap-shaped, contributing to its elegant appearance. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements in cultivation."
