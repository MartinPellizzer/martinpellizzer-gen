    "intro": "Oedera alienata, commonly known as the alien orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the temperate regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its intricate, fragrant blooms. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the acidic, well-drained soils of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, Oedera alienata is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
