    "intro": "Ononis fruticosa var. rigida, commonly known as rigid hedge-hopper, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright, woody stems and small, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
