    "intro": "Oncidium floryi, commonly known as the Florida orchid, is a tropical orchid native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in varying environmental conditions. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. Oncidium floryi prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
