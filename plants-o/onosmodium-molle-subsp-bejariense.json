    "intro": "Onosmodium molle subsp. bejariense, commonly known as the Bejari sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the eastern coastal regions of India. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued in traditional industries. The plant has simple, lanceolate leaves and produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that releases small, winged seeds for wind dispersal. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
