    "intro": "Oreorchis, commonly known as the fairy orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, delicate flowers that often resemble miniature orchids, with a unique structure that includes a single, prominent lip. Oreorchis species are typically found in temperate regions, growing in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. They have rhizomatous or tuberous roots and produce showy, often fragrant blooms in shades of white, yellow, and green. Due to their specific habitat requirements, many Oreorchis species are threatened by habitat loss and are of interest in both botanical research and conservation efforts."
