    "intro": "Oxytropis humilis, commonly known as the dwarf locoweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in poor soils and extreme temperatures. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife, though it can be toxic to livestock in large quantities."
