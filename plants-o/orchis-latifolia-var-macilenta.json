    "intro": "Orchis latifolia var. macilenta, commonly known as the broad-leaved orchid variant macilenta, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and meadows, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, violet or purple flowers in late spring. Its flowers are characterized by a distinctive lip that is often darker in color than the rest of the flower. This variant is notable for its ecological significance, supporting a variety of pollinators and serving as an indicator of healthy, undisturbed habitats."
