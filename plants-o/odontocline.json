    "intro": "Odontocline, commonly known as the \"toothed line,\" is a unique botanical feature found in certain species of aquatic plants. It refers to the arrangement of specialized structures along the stem or leaf that enhance the plant's ability to absorb nutrients from water. These structures often resemble small teeth or projections, increasing the surface area for absorption. The odontocline is particularly prominent in plants that thrive in nutrient-poor environments. This adaptation allows the plant to maximize its uptake of essential minerals and trace elements from the surrounding water."
