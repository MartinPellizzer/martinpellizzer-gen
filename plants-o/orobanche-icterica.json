    "intro": "Orobanche icterica, commonly known as the yellow barrenstar, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for its nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and absence of true leaves. The plant typically parasitizes members of the Fabaceae family, such as vetches and clovers, by inserting its haustoria into the host's vascular system. Its life cycle involves producing small, inconspicuous seeds that can remain viable in the soil for many years. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and is often considered a weed in cultivated areas."
