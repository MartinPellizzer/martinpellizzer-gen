    "intro": "Oxytropis leptophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaf locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Oxytropis leptophylla is part of the legume family and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria."
