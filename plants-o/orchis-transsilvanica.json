    "intro": "Orchis transsilvanica, commonly known as the Transylvanian orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and meadows, preferring well-drained, calcareous soils. The plant features a tall, erect stem with a single or few flowers that are usually pinkish-purple in color. Its flowers are characterized by a spurred lip and are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. Orchis transsilvanica is a protected species in many countries due to habitat loss and over-collection."
