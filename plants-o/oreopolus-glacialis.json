    "intro": "Oreopolus glacialis, commonly known as the glacier buttercup, is a herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in cold, rocky environments and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, cup-shaped blooms. Oreopolus glacialis is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and extreme temperature fluctuations. It plays a vital role in pollination and is an indicator species for high-altitude ecosystems."
