    "intro": "Ophrys fuciflora subsp. aestuariensis, commonly known as the salt marsh helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to coastal regions of Europe. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in salt marshes and coastal dunes. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip that mimics the appearance of female insects to attract male pollinators. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This subspecies is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations to coastal conditions."
