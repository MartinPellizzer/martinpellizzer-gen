    "intro": "Ophrys holosericea subsp. annae, commonly known as the Annas helleborine, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, lip-like flower that mimics the appearance of female insects, a trait evolved to attract male pollinators through mimicry. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and grasslands, where it thrives in the presence of specific mycorrhizal fungi. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture in its often humid environment. The species is of conservation interest due to habitat loss and its limited distribution."
