    "intro": "Oxalis pudica, commonly known as the humble wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Oxalis pudica thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, which can be toxic if ingested in large quantities."
