    "intro": "Oryzopsis sphacelata, commonly known as the narrowleaf beakgrass, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically less than 10 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to beige florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Oryzopsis sphacelata thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. Its ecological role includes providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in dry landscapes."
