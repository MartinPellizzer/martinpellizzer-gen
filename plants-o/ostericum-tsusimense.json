    "intro": "Ostericum tsusimense, commonly known as the Tsusim fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spores are released from the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori. Ostericum tsusimense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
