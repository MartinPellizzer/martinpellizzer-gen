    "intro": "Ophrypetalum odoratum subsp. odoratum, commonly known as the sweet-scented orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often with a waxy texture, while its flowers feature a distinctive, spurred lip that aids in pollination. The subspecies is notable for its strong, sweet aroma, which is most pronounced during the flowering season."
