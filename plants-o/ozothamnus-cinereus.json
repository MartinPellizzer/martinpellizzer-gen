    "intro": "Ozothamnus cinereus, commonly known as silverleaf daisy, is a perennial shrub native to Australia. It features silver-gray foliage that provides a striking contrast to its bright yellow flower heads. The plant produces daisy-like flowers with white ray florets surrounding a yellow disk, blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Ozothamnus cinereus is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
