    "intro": "Oplismenus oahuaensis, commonly known as the Oahua grass, is a perennial herb native to Hawaii. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green and have a smooth texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
