    "intro": "Oxalis squamiflora, commonly known as the silverleaf wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a dense rosette of silver-gray, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking foliage and delicate floral display."
