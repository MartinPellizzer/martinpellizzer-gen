    "intro": "Onobrychis montana f. decumbens, commonly known as the creeping mountain vetch, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant has small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its trifoliate leaves are composed of three oval-shaped leaflets with a hairy surface. This species is adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy plant with potential uses in erosion control and forage."
