    "intro": "Oberonia marginata, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually elongated and dark green, with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. Oberonia marginata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
