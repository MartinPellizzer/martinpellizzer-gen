    "intro": "Ononis pulchella, commonly known as the pretty bladder campion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and clusters of pink or purple flowers. The plant produces small, bladder-like seed pods that split open when mature, dispersing its seeds. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Ononis pulchella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
