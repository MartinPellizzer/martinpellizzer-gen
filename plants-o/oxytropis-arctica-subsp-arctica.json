    "intro": "Oxytropis arctica subsp. arctica, commonly known as Arctic locoweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of purple or pink. The plant produces compound leaves with small, stiff leaflets and has a deep root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. It is well-suited to cold climates and can thrive in rocky or barren environments. Oxytropis arctica subsp. arctica is often found in tundra and mountainous areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
