    "intro": "Oxalis myriophylla, commonly known as the many-leaf wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Oxalis myriophylla is a popular ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
