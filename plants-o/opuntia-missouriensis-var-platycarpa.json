    "intro": "Opuntia missouriensis var. platycarpa, commonly known as the Missouri prickly pear, is a cactus native to the central United States. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
