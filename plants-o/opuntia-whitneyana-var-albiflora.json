    "intro": "Opuntia whitneyana var. albiflora, commonly known as the whiteflower prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a deep root system that allows it to survive in arid environments. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions."
