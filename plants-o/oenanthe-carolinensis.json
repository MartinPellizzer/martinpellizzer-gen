    "intro": "Oenanthe carolinensis, commonly known as water hemlock, is a highly toxic plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and is often found in moist soils along stream banks and wetlands. It contains toxic compounds such as cicutoxin, which can be fatal to humans and animals if ingested. Due to its toxicity, it is important to identify and avoid this plant in natural habitats."
