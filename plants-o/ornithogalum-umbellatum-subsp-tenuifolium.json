    "intro": "Ornithogalum umbellatum subsp. tenuifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features a short, rhizomatous stem with clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces umbel-like inflorescences of white or pale green flowers that bloom in spring. Its flowers are often fragrant and attract various pollinators, including bees and moths. It is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
