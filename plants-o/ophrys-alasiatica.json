    "intro": "Ophrys alasiatica, commonly known as the alpine bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and produces clusters of pale yellow to brownish-green flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a basal rosette. Ophrys alasiatica thrives in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, typically between 1,500 and 2,500 meters."
