It is characterized by its evergreen, aromatic leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by dark, shiny berries. Its bark and leaves contain essential oils, which contribute to its aromatic properties and have been used in traditional medicine. Ocotea maguireana is often found in humid, lowland forests, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soils."
