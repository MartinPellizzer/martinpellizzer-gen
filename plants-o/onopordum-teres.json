    "intro": "Onopordum teres, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and large, purple or pinkish flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant is often found in dry, rocky soils and can thrive in arid environments. Its leaves are covered in dense, white hairs that give it a woolly appearance. Onopordum teres is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
