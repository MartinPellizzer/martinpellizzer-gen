    "intro": "Ovidia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered ovidia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically blooms in early summer, producing delicate blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Ovidia parviflora is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
