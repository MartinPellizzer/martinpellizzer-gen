    "intro": "Oxytropis bosculensis, commonly known as the Boskalis oxytropis, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, often found in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant features slender, upright stems and small, palmately compound leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pink or violet, arranged in dense, sparsely branched clusters. Oxytropis bosculensis is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility in nutrient-poor environments."
