    "intro": "Oxalis confertissima subsp. confertissima, commonly known as the clustered wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped lobes and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest floors. Its stems are often hairy, and it has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. Oxalis confertissima subsp. confertissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
