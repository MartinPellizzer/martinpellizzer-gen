    "intro": "Oreocome involucellata, commonly known as the mountain flax, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine regions. The plant features slender, erect stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. Its small, blue to violet flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, which attract various pollinators. Oreocome involucellata is adapted to cold, dry climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
