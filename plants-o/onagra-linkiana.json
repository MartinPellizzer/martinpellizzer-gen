    "intro": "Onagra linkiana, commonly known as the yellow balm, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its seeds are encased in a capsule and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across various habitats. Onagra linkiana is also valued for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional herbal remedies."
