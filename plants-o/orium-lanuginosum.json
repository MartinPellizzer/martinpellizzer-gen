    "intro": "Orium lanuginosum, commonly known as the woolly orium, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. The woolly orium is often found in woodland understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
