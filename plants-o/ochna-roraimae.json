    "intro": "Ochna roraimae, commonly known as the Roraima ochna, is a rare shrub endemic to the tepuis of Venezuela. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in the nutrient-poor soils of the highland plateaus, adapting to the unique microclimates of these isolated regions. Its morphology reflects evolutionary adaptations to the extreme environmental conditions of the tepuis. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
