It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. It has a slender, erect stem with a single or few flowers at the top. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
