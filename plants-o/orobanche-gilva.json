    "intro": "Orobanche gilva, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and reduced stem structure. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in dense clusters, and it typically blooms from late spring to early summer. Orobanche gilva is often found in disturbed soils and can be a problematic weed in agricultural settings. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific host plants, such as various species of legumes."
