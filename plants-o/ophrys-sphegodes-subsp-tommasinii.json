    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes subsp. tommasinii, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, with a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open grasslands or rocky areas. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
