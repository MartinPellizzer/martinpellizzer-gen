    "intro": "Opuntia schumannii, commonly known as Schumann's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in sharp spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months. Its fruit, called a tunaf, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. Opuntia schumannii is adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in some regions."
