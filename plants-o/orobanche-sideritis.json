    "intro": "Orobanche sideritis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various habitats across Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique root system that attaches to the roots of its host. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific host species, often grasses and legumes. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a role in ecological interactions but can also be a concern for agricultural crops."
