It is characterized by its erect growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized horticultural collections."
