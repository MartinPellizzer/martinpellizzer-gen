    "intro": "Orchyllium alpinum, commonly known as the alpine orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single, showy flower per stem. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Orchyllium alpinum is considered a vulnerable species."
