    "intro": "Orchis sesquipedalis var. corsica, commonly known as the Corsican orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant produces a single, erect flower spike with a single, often pink or purple-colored flower, which is highly attractive to pollinators. It thrives in calcareous soils and requires specific environmental conditions to flourish. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
