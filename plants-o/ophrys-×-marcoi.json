    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 marcoi, commonly known as the Marco's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-shaped flowers that mimic the appearance and scent of female bees, a feature known as sexual deception. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats across Europe. Its flowers are pollinated by male bees that attempt to mate with the flower's pseudocopulation structure. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its unique and striking floral morphology."
