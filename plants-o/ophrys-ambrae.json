    "intro": "Ophrys ambrae, commonly known as the amber orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female wasps to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in habitats such as grasslands and open woodlands. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in mimicry. Ophrys ambrae is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, often with a single or occasionally two blooms per inflorescence."
