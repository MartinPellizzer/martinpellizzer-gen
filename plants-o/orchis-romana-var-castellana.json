    "intro": "Orchis romana var. castellana, commonly known as the Castilian orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in southern Europe. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and striking purple or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing a single spike with several flowers that are pollinated by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
