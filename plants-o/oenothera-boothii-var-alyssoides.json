    "intro": "Oenothera boothii var. alyssoides, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is a perennial herb with slender, branching stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The species is adapted to sandy soils and can survive in low-nutrient conditions."
