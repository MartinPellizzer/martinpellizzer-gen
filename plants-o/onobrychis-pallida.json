    "intro": "Onobrychis pallida, commonly known as white sweet clover, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are pale green to white in color, and its small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. It has been historically used in agriculture for forage and soil improvement due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities. Additionally, it contains coumarin, which gives it a distinctive sweet scent."
