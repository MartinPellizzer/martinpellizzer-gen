    "intro": "Oxytropis pavlovii, commonly known as the Pavlov's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale purple or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Oxytropis pavlovii is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for certain wildlife in its native habitat."
