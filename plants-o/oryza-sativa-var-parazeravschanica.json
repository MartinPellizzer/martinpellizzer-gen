    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. parazeravschanica, commonly known as the Zeravshansky rice, is a rare and ancient variety of rice native to Central Asia. This subspecies is characterized by its short, compact grains and unique genetic makeup, which distinguishes it from other rice varieties. It typically grows in temperate climates and requires a shorter growing season compared to common rice types. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces panicles with small, fragrant flowers. Its botanical features make it of interest for genetic research and crop diversity conservation."
