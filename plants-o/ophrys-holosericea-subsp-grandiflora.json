    "intro": "Ophrys holosericea subsp. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered bee orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like floral morphology, which features a prominent, hairy lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands, often in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are pollinated through a unique mimicry mechanism that attracts male bees. This subspecies is native to parts of Europe and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological significance."
