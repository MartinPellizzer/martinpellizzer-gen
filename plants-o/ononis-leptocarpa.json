It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features slender, wiry stems covered in fine hairs and small, opposite leaves that are usually oval or lance-shaped. Its flowers are white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems, and bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant is often found in dry, sunny grasslands and rocky soils, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds."
