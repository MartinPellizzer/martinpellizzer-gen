    "intro": "Ophrys cypria, commonly known as the Cyprian orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like appearance, with a flower that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its flowers are usually a mix of brown and yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in its mimicry. Ophrys cypria is a rare and protected species, often found in specific microhabitats across southern Europe."
