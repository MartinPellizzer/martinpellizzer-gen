    "intro": "Oxalis corniculata var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and small, yellow flowers that resemble those of the wood sorrel. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in gardens and disturbed soils. It is a perennial herb that can spread through rhizomes, making it somewhat invasive in certain regions. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in traditional medicine."
