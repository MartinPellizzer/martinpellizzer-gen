    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. chlorocarpa, commonly known as the green-seeded rice, is a variant of the rice species characterized by its unique green seed color. This variety is primarily cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with long, slender leaves and panicles that bear small, rice grains. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a complex inflorescence structure typical of the grass family. The green-seeded rice is notable for its distinct pigmentation, which is due to the presence of chlorophyll in the seed coat."
