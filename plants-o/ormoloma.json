These plants are characterized by their striking blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by spiny, bract-like leaves. Ormoloma species are typically found in coastal and saline environments, showcasing their adaptability to harsh conditions. Their leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The genus includes several species, such as Ormoloma arenicola, which is native to the Mediterranean region."
