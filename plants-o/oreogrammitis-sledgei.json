It is a cryptogamic plant characterized by its small, delicate, and often densely packed foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or tree trunks in temperate regions. Its structure consists of a thallus with leaf-like structures arranged in a rosette pattern. Oreogrammitis sledgei plays a role in ecological succession and is often used as an indicator species for certain environmental conditions."
