    "intro": "Orobanche gracilis var. psilantha, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, pale yellow to reddish flowers. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, often forming dense clusters. Its roots are specialized for attaching to the roots of host plants, and it is found in various regions of Europe and Asia. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem by influencing the growth and distribution of its host species."
