    "intro": "Orchis tephrosanthos var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and its distinctive, showy flowers that typically range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. It is a perennial herb that produces a single, tall flowering stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in several regions."
