    "intro": "Oxytropis vasskovskyi, commonly known as the Vasskovsky's locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the steppes of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow or white pea-like flowers, which are typically arranged in dense, elongated inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in legumes, a typical feature of the Fabaceae family, and are often dispersed by wind or animals. Oxytropis vasskovskyi is adapted to dry, semi-arid environments and is often found in grassland and steppe ecosystems."
