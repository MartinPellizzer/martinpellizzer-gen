It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, spherical berries that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant is shrub-like, with small leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. The berries are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though their botanical significance lies mainly in their morphology and ecological role."
