It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, strap-like leaves and showy, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its bulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh conditions. Oreomyrrhis involucrata plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and moths."
