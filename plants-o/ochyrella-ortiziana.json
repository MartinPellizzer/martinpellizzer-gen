It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, delicate flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in the understory of tropical forests. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, adapted to maximize light absorption in low-light conditions. Ochyrella ortiziana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
