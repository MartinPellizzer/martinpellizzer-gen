    "intro": "Orchis beesiana, commonly known as the bees' orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often in woodland or grassland habitats. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive lip that serves as a landing platform for pollinators. Its structure includes a basal rosette of leaves and a flowering stem that can reach up to 50 cm in height. Orchis beesiana relies on specific pollinators, such as bees, for reproduction, making it an important species in its ecosystem."
