    "intro": "Oligosporus orophilus, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred petals and compact growth habit. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are often pale purple or white, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oligosporus orophilus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
