    "intro": "Odontadenia zuccariniana var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-flowered devil's backbone, is a unique member of the Boraginaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often spiny stems that resemble a backbone, hence its common name. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, adding a striking visual element to its appearance. Its leaves are typically opposite and have a rough texture, contributing to its rugged aesthetic. Native to southern Africa, this plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient and drought-tolerant species."
