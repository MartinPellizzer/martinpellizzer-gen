    "intro": "Oxystophyllum kaudernii, commonly known as the Kaudern's oxystophyllum, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist environment to thrive. Its leaves are palmate, with five to seven lobes, and it produces small, woolly fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Oxystophyllum kaudernii is considered a species of conservation concern."
