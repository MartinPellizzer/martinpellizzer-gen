    "intro": "Orchis palustris subsp. laxiflora, commonly known as the looseflower marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually arranged in a loose, racemose inflorescence, giving it its common name. Orchis palustris subsp. laxiflora is a rare and protected species, often found in specific habitats that are threatened by habitat loss and environmental changes."
