It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It is often found as an epiphyte on trees in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant morphology and ecology."
