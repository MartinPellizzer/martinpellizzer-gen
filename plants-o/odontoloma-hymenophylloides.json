    "intro": "Odontoloma hymenophylloides, commonly known as the velvetleaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, ovate pinnae that are often covered in a fine, silky texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds."
