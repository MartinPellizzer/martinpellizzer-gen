    "intro": "Ophioglossum namegatae, commonly known as the Japanese adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to Japan. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often slightly curved fronds that resemble the shape of an adder's tongue. The plant has a distinctive reproductive structure called a sorus, which contains the spore-producing organs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest undergrowth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
