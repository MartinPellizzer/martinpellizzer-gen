    "intro": "Omphalocarpum ahia, commonly known as the coastal burr, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces distinctive, spiny fruits that contain a single seed, which is adapted for dispersal by animals. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dune environments. Its botanical features make it well-suited to withstand harsh coastal conditions."
