It belongs to the family Alstromeriaceae and is characterized by its striking, orchid-like flowers with violet to purple petals. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring a basal rosette of lanceolate leaves. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early autumn, producing showy inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
