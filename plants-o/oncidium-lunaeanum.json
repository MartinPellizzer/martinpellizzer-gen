    "intro": "Oncidium lunaeanum, commonly known as the Moonlight Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to South America. It features showy, long-lasting flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow, often with contrasting purple or red markings. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are epiphytic, allowing it to grow on trees or other surfaces without soil. Oncidium lunaeanum is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
