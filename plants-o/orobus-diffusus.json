    "intro": "Orobus diffusus, commonly known as the spreading orobrush, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry slopes and rocky areas. Orobus diffusus is a hardy, drought-tolerant plant that plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat."
