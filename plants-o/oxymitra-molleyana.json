It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens despite its limited distribution in the wild."
