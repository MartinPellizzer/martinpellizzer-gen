    "intro": "Ornithogalum minimum var. acaule, commonly known as the dwarf star-of-Bethlehem, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact growth habit with a single, slender stem that produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant has a short, underground bulb and lacks a distinct stem, giving it its varietal name \"acaule.\" Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from the base of the bulb. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers."
