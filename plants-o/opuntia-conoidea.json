    "intro": "Opuntia conoidea, commonly known as the conical prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in sharp spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers, which are typically followed by red, fleshy fruits. Opuntia conoidea is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems. It is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance."
