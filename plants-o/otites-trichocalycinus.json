This plant is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, velvety hairs. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds upon maturity. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often found in disturbed soils. It has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
