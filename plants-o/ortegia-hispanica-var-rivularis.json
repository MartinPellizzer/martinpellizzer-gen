    "intro": "Ortegia hispanica var. rivularis, commonly known as the river ortegia, is a rare aquatic plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as streams and rivers, where it attaches to submerged rocks or vegetation. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that help it capture sunlight while remaining submerged. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and pollution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
