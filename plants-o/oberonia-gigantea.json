    "intro": "Oberonia gigantea, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 cm in diameter, with a distinctive greenish-yellow coloration. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Oberonia gigantea is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
