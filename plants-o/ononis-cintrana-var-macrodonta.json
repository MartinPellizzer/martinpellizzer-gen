It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing habit and succulent, often hairy stems. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. Its leaves are typically opposite, linear, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is often found in rocky soils and coastal areas, showcasing its resilience to harsh conditions."
