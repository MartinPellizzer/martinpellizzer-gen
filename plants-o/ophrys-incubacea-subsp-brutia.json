It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow and brown, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. The subspecies is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism and is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
