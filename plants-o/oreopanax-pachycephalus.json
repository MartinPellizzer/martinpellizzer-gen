    "intro": "Oreopanax pachycephalus, commonly known as the thick-headed sycoglossum, is a species of flowering plant in the Araliaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in countries like Peru and Bolivia. The plant is characterized by its thick, woody stems and large, palmate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its fruit is a bright red berry containing several seeds. Oreopanax pachycephalus is adapted to high-altitude environments and plays a role in the ecological systems of its native habitat."
