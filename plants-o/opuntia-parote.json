    "intro": "Opuntia parote, commonly known as the Parot\u00e9 prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems that are covered in small, spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and often used in traditional cuisines. Opuntia parote is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and minimizing water loss through its waxy surface."
