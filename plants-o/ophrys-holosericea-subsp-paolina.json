    "intro": "Ophrys holosericea subsp. paolina, commonly known as the Paolina Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the alpine regions of the Italian Alps. It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, featuring a complex, bee-mimicking pouch that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps. Its flowers are usually pale green to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
