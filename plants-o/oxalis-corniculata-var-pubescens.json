    "intro": "Oxalis corniculata var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to Asia and parts of Africa. It is a low-growing perennial with heart-shaped leaves and small, yellow flowers that resemble those of true sorrels. The plant is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) stems and leaves, which give it its specific variety name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in gardens and wild areas. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
