    "intro": "Ochradenus baccatus var. scandens, commonly known as the creeping sandthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems that grow close to the ground, forming a low, mat-like structure. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Its leaves are small, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. This species is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes."
