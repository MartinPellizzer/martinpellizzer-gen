    "intro": "Ornithogalum brevifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a short, stocky stem with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the spring or early summer. Its bulbs are underground and serve as storage organs, enabling the plant to survive dry periods. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to Mediterranean-type climates."
