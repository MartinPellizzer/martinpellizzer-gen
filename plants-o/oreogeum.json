It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in whorls around the stems. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer. Oreogeum is well adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils."
