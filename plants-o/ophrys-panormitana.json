    "intro": "Ophrys panormitana, commonly known as the Panormita bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insect wings. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophrys panormitana is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
