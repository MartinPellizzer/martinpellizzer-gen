    "intro": "Oxycarpha suaedifolia, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid regions of North America. It features a mat-forming habit with narrow, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its hairy stems and leaves are adapted to withstand high temperatures and low moisture availability. Oxycarpha suaedifolia plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
