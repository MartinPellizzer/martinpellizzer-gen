It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers with intricate patterns and a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. This variety is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively ease of cultivation under proper conditions."
