    "intro": "Oldenlandia vestita, commonly known as the white spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling tiny spiders, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy areas, and its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Oldenlandia vestita is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
