    "intro": "Oenanthe quitensis, commonly known as the Andean water dropwort, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its small white or greenish flowers are clustered in umbels, a feature common in the Apiaceae family. Oenanthe quitensis is adapted to the cold, high-altitude environment with its short growing season and specialized root system."
