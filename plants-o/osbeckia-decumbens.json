    "intro": "Osbeckia decumbens, commonly known as the creeping willow or yellow willow, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its prostrate or decumbent stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and covered with fine, soft hairs. Osbeckia decumbens is often found in moist, disturbed soils along streambanks and in open woodlands."
