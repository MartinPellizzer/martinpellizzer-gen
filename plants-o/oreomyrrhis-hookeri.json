    "intro": "Oreomyrrhis hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's oreomyrrh, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky streambanks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pale green flowers arranged in a spike. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Oreomyrrhis hookeri is valued for its ecological role in supporting local insect populations and its ornamental appeal in shaded garden settings."
