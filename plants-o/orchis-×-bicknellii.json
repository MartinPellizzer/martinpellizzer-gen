    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 bicknellii, commonly known as Bicknell's twayblade, is a hybrid orchid species native to the northeastern United States. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and exhibits characteristics typical of the twayblade genus, including a slender, grass-like appearance. The plant produces a single spike of flowers, usually with purple or pink petals, and has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Its botanical structure reflects a blend of its parent species, Orchis pallida and Orchis mascula, in both morphology and genetics. This hybrid is often found in moist, shaded woodlands where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils."
