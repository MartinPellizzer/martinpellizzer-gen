It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces large, showy yellow or white flowers that bloom in the summer. Its fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and often used in culinary applications. Opuntia leucacantha is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
