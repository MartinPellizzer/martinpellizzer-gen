    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 eliasii, commonly known as the Elias's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a bee-like labellum that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant is native to southern Europe and thrives in calcareous soils, often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to brown, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. The species is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its specialized pollination mechanism and limited distribution."
