It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinct midrib and small, rounded lobes.

It is a popular choice for rock gardens and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ease of cultivation."
