    "intro": "Oncidium aspidorhinum, commonly known as the \"spider orchid,\" is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, long, and often curved inflorescence with bright yellow and green flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in variable conditions. Oncidium aspidorhinum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
