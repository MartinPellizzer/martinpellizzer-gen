    "intro": "Orobanche akiana, commonly known as the Indian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of Asia, including India and China. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves germinating in response to chemical signals from its host. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of agricultural crops."
