    "intro": "Octoplis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, and is often found in shaded, moist environments. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its unique appearance and limited habitat make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern. Due to habitat destruction and environmental changes, Octoplis is listed as endangered in several states."
