The plant features dense, cushion-like growth with a hairy appearance on its stems and leaves. Its spores are produced in small, clustered capsules that are often covered in a thick, waxy layer. Oligosporus pannosus is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms."
