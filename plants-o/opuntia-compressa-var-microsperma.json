    "intro": "Opuntia compressa var. microsperma, commonly known as the small-seeded prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy pads covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, round fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soil conditions and extreme temperatures. Opuntia compressa var. microsperma is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of food in some regions."
