It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels, cinnamon, and avocado. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves, which are typically dark green and glossy on top and lighter in color underneath. Its flowers are small and fragrant, often clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Ocotea harrisii plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
