    "intro": "Odostemon ehrenbergii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces yellow composite flowers, which are typically clustered in a flat-topped inflorescence. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems. Odostemon ehrenbergii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed or sandy soils."
