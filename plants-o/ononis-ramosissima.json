    "intro": "Ononis ramosissima, commonly known as the creeping eryngo, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and rocky areas. The plant features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous branched stems that root at the nodes. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense, spherical heads, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind. Botanically, it is characterized by its aromatic leaves and its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
