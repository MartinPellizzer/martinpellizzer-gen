    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 surdi, commonly known as the deaf orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is characterized by its intricate flower structure, which mimics the appearance of female wasps to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant typically grows in temperate regions with moist, well-drained soils and partial shade. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with dark markings, and they emit a subtle scent to further mimic the wasp. Ophrys \u00d7 surdi is valued for its unique morphology and ecological role in pollination networks."
