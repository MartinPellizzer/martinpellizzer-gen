It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to form clumps over time. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. This orchid thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, rich soil for optimal growth."
