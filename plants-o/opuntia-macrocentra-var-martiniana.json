    "intro": "Opuntia macrocentra var. martiniana, commonly known as the Martin's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in sharp spines and clusters of bright yellow flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations such as succulent stems for water storage. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores. The fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and often used in local cuisines."
