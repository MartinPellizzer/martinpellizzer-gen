    "intro": "Opuntia sericea var. maelenii, commonly known as the Maelen's prickly pear, is a cactus species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems that are covered in dense clusters of spines and glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by edible, fleshy fruits. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and in some regions for its edible fruit."
