    "intro": "Orobanche hirtiflora, commonly known as the hairy broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its flowering stems that bear small, tubular flowers. The plant produces numerous seeds, which can remain viable in the soil for many years. It is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, often parasitizing members of the legume family. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and productivity of its host plants."
