    "intro": "Odontadenia polyneura, commonly known as the mountain devil, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern regions of Australia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which bloom during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as heathlands and coastal dunes. Odontadenia polyneura is well adapted to arid conditions and is known for its resilience to drought and poor soil nutrients."
