    "intro": "Opuntia thurberi subsp. versicolor, commonly known as the Thurber's prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, spineless pads and vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant produces edible fruits known as tunas, which are typically yellow or orange when ripe. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils and in desert scrub habitats. Its structure and growth patterns make it well adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures."
