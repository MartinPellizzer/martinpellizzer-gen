    "intro": "Ossaea tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive quadrangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom during the cooler months. Ossaea tetragona is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and ability to store water. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
