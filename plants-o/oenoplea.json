    "intro": "Oenoplea, commonly known as the \"butterfly plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble butterflies, hence its common name. The plants typically have opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produce small, tubular flowers in clusters. Oenoplea species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and are often cultivated for their ornamental value. They thrive in well-drained soil and require full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
