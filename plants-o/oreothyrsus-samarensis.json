It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and compact growth habit. The plant typically features showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in montane rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
