    "intro": "Ostrya, commonly known as ironwood or water birch, is a genus of deciduous trees belonging to the betulaceae family. These plants are characterized by their small, ovate leaves that are often serrated and turn yellow in the fall. The flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate trees, and they produce small, winged fruits. Ostrya species are typically found in moist, well-drained soils in temperate regions. They are valued for their hard, durable wood and their ecological role in supporting various wildlife species."
