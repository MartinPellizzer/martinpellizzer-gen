    "intro": "Orchis dilatata, commonly known as the broad-leaved orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces a single spike of flowers that can range in color from white to pink or purple. Orchis dilatata thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. It plays an important role in pollination and is a valuable component of its native ecosystems."
