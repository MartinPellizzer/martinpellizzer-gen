    "intro": "Oenothera sublinearis, commonly known as the narrowleaf evening primrose, is a species of flowering plant in the Onagraceae family. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its linear, narrow leaves are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Oenothera sublinearis is often found in sandy soils and is a characteristic species of desert and grassland habitats."
