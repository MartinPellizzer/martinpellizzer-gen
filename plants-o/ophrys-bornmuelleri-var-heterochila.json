    "intro": "Ophrys bornmuelleri var. heterochila, commonly known as the heterochilous bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a complex lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands or forest edges. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
