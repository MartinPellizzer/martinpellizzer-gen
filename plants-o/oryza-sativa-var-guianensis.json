    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. guianensis, commonly known as the Guianese rice, is a less commonly cultivated variety of rice native to South America. This plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and long, narrow leaves, typical of the grass family. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous pale yellow flowers, which develop into rice grains after pollination. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, requiring warm temperatures and ample water for optimal growth. Due to its limited cultivation, it is primarily of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers."
