    "intro": "Ophrys argolica subsp. icariensis, commonly known as the Icarian bee orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the Greek region of Argolis. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity."
