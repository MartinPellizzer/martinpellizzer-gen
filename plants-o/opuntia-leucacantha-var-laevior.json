    "intro": "Opuntia leucacantha var. laevior, commonly known as the smooth prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in small, pale spines. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit."
