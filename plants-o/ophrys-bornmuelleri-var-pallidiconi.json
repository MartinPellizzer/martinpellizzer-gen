    "intro": "Ophrys bornmuelleri var. pallidiconi, commonly known as the pale-coned orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a lip that mimics the appearance of a female insect, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in mimicry. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
