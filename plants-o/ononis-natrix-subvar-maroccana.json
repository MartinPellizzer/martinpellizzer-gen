It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are linear and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
