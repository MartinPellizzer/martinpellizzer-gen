    "intro": "Ornithogalum sandalioticum, commonly known as the sandalwood lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers with a strong, spicy fragrance. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that help it survive dry periods. Ornithogalum sandalioticum is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its historical use in traditional medicine."
