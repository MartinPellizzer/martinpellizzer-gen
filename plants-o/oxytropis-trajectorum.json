    "intro": "Oxytropis trajectorum, commonly known as the Trajectoan Locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has adapted to arid environments through its deep root system and ability to fix nitrogen, which helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Oxytropis trajectorum is also known for its toxic alkaloids, which can affect livestock that graze on it."
