    "intro": "Opulus glandulosa, commonly known as the European whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, white to pale pink flowers that appear in clusters. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, often with glandular dots on the underside. The tree produces small, oval berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
