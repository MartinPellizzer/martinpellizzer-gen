    "intro": "Ornithogalum epigeum, commonly known as the dwarf star of Bethlehem, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, low-growing habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of star-shaped, white or pale blue flowers. The plant is characterized by its underground bulb, which stores nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Ornithogalum epigeum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in gardens."
