    "intro": "Ophrys neglecta var. riphaea, commonly known as the Alpine bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Ophrys neglecta var. riphaea is a protected species due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes."
