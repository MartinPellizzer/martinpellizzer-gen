    "intro": "Orobus tuberosus var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in terminal racemes. Its tuberous roots are edible when properly prepared and have been used by Indigenous peoples for food and medicine. The species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions."
