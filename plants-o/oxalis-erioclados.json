    "intro": "Oxalis erioclados, commonly known as the velvetleaf wood sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves with a velvety texture and bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a creeping rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are often mistaken for those of Oxalis tetraphylla, but it can be distinguished by its smaller, more rounded leaflets. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along streambanks."
