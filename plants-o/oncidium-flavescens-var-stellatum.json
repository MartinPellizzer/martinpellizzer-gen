It features showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive star-shaped pattern on the lip. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the air and soil. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil with high humidity."
