    "intro": "Opuntia echinocarpa var. nuda, commonly known as the naked prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, spineless pads and vibrant yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sun exposure. Its pads are edible when mature and have been used traditionally for food and medicinal purposes. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to prevent soil erosion in desert landscapes."
