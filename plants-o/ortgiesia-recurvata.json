    "intro": "Ortgiesia recurvata, commonly known as the recurved orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, intricately shaped flowers. The plant produces pale yellow to greenish-white blooms, which are often clustered in loose racemes. Ortgiesia recurvata thrives in cool, humid environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
