    "intro": "Orobanche livida, commonly known as the pale broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that belongs to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of various herbaceous species. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of specific host plants, which vary depending on the region. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, Orobanche livida is of interest in botanical studies and ecological research."
