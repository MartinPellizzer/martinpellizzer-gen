    "intro": "Opuntia diploursina, commonly known as the two-lobed prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are typically green and covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia diploursina is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and reducing transpiration through its spiny exterior. Its structure and growth habits make it well-suited for survival in desert and semi-desert regions."
