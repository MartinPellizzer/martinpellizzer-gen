    "intro": "Orthophytum formosense, commonly known as the Brazilian feather plant, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often adorned with striking red or orange markings. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular in tropical and subtropical gardens."
