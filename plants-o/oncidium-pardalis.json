    "intro": "Oncidium pardalis, commonly known as the tiger orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with fleshy roots adapted for moisture retention. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often with contrasting stripes or spots. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged in a fan shape around the pseudobulbs. Oncidium pardalis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
