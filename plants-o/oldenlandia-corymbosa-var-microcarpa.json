It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its fruits are tiny, dry capsules that contain minute seeds, typical of the Commelinaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
