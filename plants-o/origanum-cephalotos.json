    "intro": "Origanum cephalotos, commonly known as poison ivy. This plant is a member of the Lamiaceae family and is native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its serrated leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant contains urushiol, a toxic oil that can cause severe skin irritation in humans. It is often mistaken for other members of the mint family but is highly allergenic and should be handled with care."
