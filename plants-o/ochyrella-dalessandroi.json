    "intro": "Ochyrella dalessandroi, commonly known as the Dalessandro's orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking violet and white flowers, which bloom during the cooler months. The plant has a compact growth habit with a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to the high-altitude environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
