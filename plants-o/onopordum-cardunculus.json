    "intro": "Onopordum cardunculus, commonly known as the artichoke thistle, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces edible cardoon stalks, which are similar to artichokes but have a more bitter flavor. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or disturbed soils. Onopordum cardunculus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
