    "intro": "Orobanche brassicae, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It parasitizes a wide range of host plants, including those in the Brassicaceae family such as cabbages and mustards. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
