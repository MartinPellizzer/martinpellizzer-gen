    "intro": "Odontosoria tenera, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant has a delicate, creeping rhizome with numerous fronds that are usually lance-shaped and glossy. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Odontosoria tenera is characterized by its finely divided leaves and its ability to thrive in humid, nutrient-rich soils."
