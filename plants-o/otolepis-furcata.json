    "intro": "Otolepis furcata, commonly known as the forked sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it forms dense tussocks with slender, triangular stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in panicles. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a bluish-green hue. Otolepis furcata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
