It is a low-growing shrub with dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, white wax, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Oxypetalum muticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
