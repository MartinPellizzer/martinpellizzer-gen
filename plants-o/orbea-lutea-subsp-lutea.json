    "intro": "Orbea lutea subsp. lutea, commonly known as the yellow orbea, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are usually small and thick, adapted to minimize water loss. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
