    "intro": "Oberonia bisaccata, commonly known as the two-pouched orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of two elongated, sac-like structures that house its flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small and greenish-white, with a distinctive spurred lip. Oberonia bisaccata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
