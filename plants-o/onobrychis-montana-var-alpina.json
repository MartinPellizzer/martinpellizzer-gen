    "intro": "Onobrychis montana var. alpina, commonly known as alpine burclover, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers arranged in racemes. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Its seed pods are typically woody and contain several small, rounded seeds."
