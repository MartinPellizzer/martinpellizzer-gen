    "intro": "Onobrychis marashensis var. longicaulis, commonly known as the long-stemmed goat's rue, is a perennial legume native to the highlands of Turkey. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and bipinnate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by long, slender pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates. This variety is of interest for its potential in forage and ecological restoration due to its hardy nature and nitrogen-fixing ability."
