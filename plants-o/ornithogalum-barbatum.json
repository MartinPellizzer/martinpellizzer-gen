    "intro": "Ornithogalum barbatum, commonly known as the beard lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and its flowers are arranged in a loose umbel, typically white or pale green in color. The plant produces small, white berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or rocky areas. Ornithogalum barbatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
