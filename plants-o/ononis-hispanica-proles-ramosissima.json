    "intro": "Ononis hispanica proles ramosissima, commonly known as the Spanish broom or broomweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and wastelands. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by narrow, elongated seed pods. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a pioneer species and a potential invasive plant in certain regions."
