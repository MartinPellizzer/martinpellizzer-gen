It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and its distinctive, lip-like flower that resembles a female bee, aiding in its unique pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland or grassland habitats. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a fragrant, yellowish-green coloration. Ophrys labiosa is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its specialized mimicry to attract male bees for pollination."
