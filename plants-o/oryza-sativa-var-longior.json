    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. longior, commonly known as the long-grain rice, is a cultivated variety of rice characterized by its elongated grains and high amylose content. It is native to Southeast Asia and is primarily grown in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is an annual grass with tall, slender stems and narrow leaves, typically reaching heights of 1 to 2 meters. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle, which bears small, spikelet-like flowers. The grains develop from the flowers and are harvested when mature, contributing to its importance as a staple food crop worldwide."
