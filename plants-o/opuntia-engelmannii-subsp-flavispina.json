    "intro": "Opuntia engelmannii subsp. flavispina, commonly known as the yellow-spined prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its spines are shorter and more yellowish compared to other Opuntia species, giving it its common name. This subspecies is well adapted to arid environments and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife."
