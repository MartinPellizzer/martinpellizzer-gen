    "intro": "Ophrys cretica subsp. naxia, commonly known as the Naxian bee orchid, is a specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Ophrys cretica subsp. naxia is a rare and protected species, often found in specific microhabitats across southern Europe."
