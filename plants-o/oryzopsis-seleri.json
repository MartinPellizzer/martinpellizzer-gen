    "intro": "Oryzopsis seleri, commonly known as the Seler's false rice, is a perennial grass native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and flooded meadows, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in suitable environments. Oryzopsis seleri is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
