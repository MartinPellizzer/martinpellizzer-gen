    "intro": "Orobanche foetida var. broteri, commonly known as the stinking broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, erect stems and yellowish to brownish flowers. This species is native to parts of Africa and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor, which is thought to attract specific pollinators. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact agricultural crops if left unchecked."
