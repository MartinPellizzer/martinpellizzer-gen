    "intro": "Oxymeris subseriata, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Oxymeris subseriata is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which is used in furniture and construction, though it is also threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss."
