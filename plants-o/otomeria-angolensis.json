    "intro": "Otomeria angolensis, commonly known as the Angola otomeria, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Otomeria angolensis is often found in coastal and inland regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
