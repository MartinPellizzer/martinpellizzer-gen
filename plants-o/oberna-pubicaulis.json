    "intro": "[WRONG START] Obernna pubicaulis, commonly known as the hairy leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive hairy leaves, which give it its scientific name, and its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. The orchid's flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with a unique pattern of markings that aid in pollination by insects."
