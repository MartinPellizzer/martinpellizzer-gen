    "intro": "Oxytropis macounii, commonly known as Macoun's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Oxytropis macounii is often found in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife, though it is not commonly cultivated."
