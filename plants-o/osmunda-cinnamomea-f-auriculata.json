    "intro": "Osmunda cinnamomea f. auriculata, commonly known as the cinnamon fern with auriculate fronds, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive, gracefully arching fronds. The plant features a tall, slender, cinnamon-colored sterile stem, from which the fertile fronds emerge in a rosette formation. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a unique auriculate (ear-shaped) structure at the base of the pinnae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in horticultural settings."
