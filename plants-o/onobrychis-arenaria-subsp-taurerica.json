    "intro": "Onobrychis arenaria subsp. taurerica, commonly known as the Tauric vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. Its pods contain small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and stabilize soil."
