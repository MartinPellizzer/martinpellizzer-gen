    "intro": "Onosmodium pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's ghost flower, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous plant with distinctive, waxy, and pale green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and requires specific microclimatic conditions to thrive. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
