    "intro": "Oxybaphus decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate lily or false lily, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and fleshy, often reddish stems. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are broad, fleshy, and arranged in a basal rosette, which helps it conserve moisture in arid environments. Oxybaphus decumbens is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
