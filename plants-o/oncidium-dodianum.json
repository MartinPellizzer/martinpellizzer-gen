    "intro": "Oncidium dodianum, commonly known as the Yellow Oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling a cascade of small, delicate blooms. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in varied environmental conditions. Its leaves are typically strap-shaped and grass-like, providing a lush, green backdrop to its vibrant flowers. Oncidium dodianum is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its relatively low maintenance and long-lasting blooms."
