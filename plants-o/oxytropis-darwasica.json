    "intro": "Oxytropis darwasica, commonly known as Darwasica locoweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in Central Asia. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. It is known for its toxic alkaloids, which can affect livestock and humans if ingested. Oxytropis darwasica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats due to its deep root system."
