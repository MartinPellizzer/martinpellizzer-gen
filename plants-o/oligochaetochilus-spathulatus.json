    "intro": "Oligochaetochilus spathulatus, commonly known as the broad-leafed moss orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or branches in tropical rainforests. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful preservation."
