    "intro": "Ononis natrix var. glabriuscula, commonly known as the smooth sand-verbena, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Its low-growing habit and drought tolerance make it well adapted to harsh, sun-exposed conditions."
