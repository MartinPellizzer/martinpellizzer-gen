    "intro": "Oxyacantha mollis, commonly known as the soft-fruited nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often hairy and have a slightly serrated edge. Its flowers are typically purple or blue, with a bell-shaped corolla, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but contain toxic compounds. Oxyacantha mollis is often found in woodland edges and rocky soils, where it thrives in partial shade."
