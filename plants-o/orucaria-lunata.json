    "intro": "Orucaria lunata, commonly known as the moonflower tree, is a rare and unique plant native to the coastal regions of southern South America. It is a small, evergreen tree that typically grows in sandy soils along the shoreline. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and its striking white flowers that bloom at night. Orucaria lunata is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
