    "intro": "Oxytropis montana, commonly known as mountain locoweed, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as alpine meadows and sagebrush steppe. Its trifoliate leaves are pinnately compound, and it produces small, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. Oxytropis montana is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid regions."
