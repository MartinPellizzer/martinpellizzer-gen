    "intro": "Ophrys andria, commonly known as the Andria bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of a bee's body. Ophrys andria is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, often blooming in late spring or early summer."
