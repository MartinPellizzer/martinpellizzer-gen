    "intro": "Opuntia saxicola, commonly known as the rock cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial cactus that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features flattened, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and covered in spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, and it produces small, edible fruits that are often consumed by wildlife. Opuntia saxicola is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient and hardy plant in its native habitat."
