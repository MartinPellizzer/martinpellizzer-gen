    "intro": "Oxyceros kesslerianus, commonly known as the Kessler's oxyceros, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests. The plant features elliptical, leathery leaves with a smooth surface and a deep green color. Its flowers are small and clustered, often with a yellowish hue, while its fruit is a capsule containing several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oxyceros kesslerianus is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
