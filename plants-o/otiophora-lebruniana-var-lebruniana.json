    "intro": "Otiophora lebruniana var. lebruniana, commonly known as the Lebrun's lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is a foliose lichen, characterized by its leaf-like thallus that is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on bark or soil in temperate regions. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on its symbiotic relationship between algae and fungi for nutrient absorption. This lichen is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
