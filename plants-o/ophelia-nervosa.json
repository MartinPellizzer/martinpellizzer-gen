    "intro": "Ophelia nervosa, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are divided into thread-like segments, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. Ophelia nervosa typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl."
