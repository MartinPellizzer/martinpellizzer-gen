    "intro": "Orobanche galii, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, pale yellow or white flowers and has a tuberous root system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to parasitize crops like wheat and barley. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth patterns of its host plants, making it a challenging species to manage in farmland."
