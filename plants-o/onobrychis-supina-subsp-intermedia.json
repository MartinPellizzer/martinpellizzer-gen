    "intro": "Onobrychis supina subsp. intermedia, commonly known as the creeping burr clover, is a low-growing perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features prostrate or ascending stems with trifoliate leaves composed of three oval, hairy leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers in racemes, followed by pods that contain several oval, hairy seeds. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment and erosion control."
