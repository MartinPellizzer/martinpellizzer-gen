    "intro": "Octomeria diaphana, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, white, translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrates. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on the trunks of trees in wetlands or swampy areas. Due to its specific habitat requirements and declining populations, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
