    "intro": "Oldenlandia paludosa, commonly known as marsh spiderwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in the Americas. It features slender, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Oldenlandia paludosa is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, contributing to the ecological diversity of these wetland environments."
