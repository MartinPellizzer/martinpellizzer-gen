    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia var. tarbatonica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces striking violet or purple flowers in late spring. Its inflorescence consists of a single spike bearing several showy, spurred orchid flowers. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Orchis angustifolia."
