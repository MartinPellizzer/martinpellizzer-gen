    "intro": "Osteospermum trigonum, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a perennial shrub that produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant features a compact growth habit with silvery-gray foliage that adds visual interest. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Osteospermum trigonum is well-suited for rock gardens, containers, and coastal gardens due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in full sun."
