    "intro": "Ophrys pubescens, commonly known as the hairy bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with brown markings, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Ophrys pubescens is a perennial herb that thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in areas with a temperate climate."
