    "intro": "Orchis pseudofragrans, commonly known as the false fragrant orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by attracting insects. Its roots contain alkaloids, which have been studied for potential medicinal properties. Orchis pseudofragrans is often mistaken for the more fragrant Orchis fragrans due to their similar appearance."
