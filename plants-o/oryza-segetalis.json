    "intro": "Oryza segetalis, commonly known as wild rice, is a grass species native to Asia, particularly found in wetland environments. It is closely related to cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) and shares similar morphological traits. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender, grass-like leaves and spikelet inflorescences. Its seeds are small, elongated grains that are often harvested from waterlogged soils. Oryza segetalis is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its potential as a genetic resource for rice improvement."
