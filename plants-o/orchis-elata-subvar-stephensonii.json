    "intro": "Orchis elata subvar. stephensonii, commonly known as the Stephenson's marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and damp woodlands, thriving in nutrient-rich soils. The plant produces tall, erect stems with a single, showy flower that is usually purple or violet in color. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil, which is characteristic of many orchid species. This subvariety is distinguished by its specific habitat preferences and floral morphology."
