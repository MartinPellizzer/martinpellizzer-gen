    "intro": "Orites lancifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orite, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a shrub characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the dry, sunny conditions of its native habitat. Its flowers bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, Orites lancifolius is considered a rare and endangered species."
