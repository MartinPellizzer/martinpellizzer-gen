    "intro": "Orobanche rapum var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth root broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its yellow or reddish-brown flowers. This species typically parasitizes members of the Brassicaceae family, such as cabbages and mustards. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by its host. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can be a nuisance in agricultural settings."
