    "intro": "Oncidium planilabre, commonly known as the flat-lipped orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and green. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapting to its humid, shaded habitats. Oncidium planilabre is valued in horticulture for its long-lasting blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
