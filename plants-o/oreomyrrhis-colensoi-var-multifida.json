    "intro": "Oreomyrrhis colensoi var. multifida, commonly known as the Colenso's orchid, is a rare and unique plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky areas. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, and the inflorescence consists of clustered, showy blooms. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
