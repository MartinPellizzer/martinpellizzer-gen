    "intro": "Obione parryi, commonly known as the Parry's obione, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of North America. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple in color. Obione parryi thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
