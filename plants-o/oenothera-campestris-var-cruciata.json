    "intro": "Oenothera campestris var. cruciata, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its yellow flowers that open in the evening and close by morning, a trait known as nyctinasty. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils and in open, sunny habitats. The species is part of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is known for its ecological importance to pollinators such as moths and beetles."
