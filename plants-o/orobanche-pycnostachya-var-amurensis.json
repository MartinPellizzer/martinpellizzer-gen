    "intro": "Orobanche pycnostachya var. amurensis, commonly known as the Amur dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and reduced leaves. This species typically parasitizes various plants in the legume family, such as Vicia and Astragalus. It is native to eastern Asia, including regions of Russia and China. Due to its parasitic nature and limited host range, it plays a minor role in ecological systems but is of interest in botanical studies."
