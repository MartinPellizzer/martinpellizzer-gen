    "intro": "Oreorchis bashanensis, commonly known as the Bashan orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and striking, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Oreorchis bashanensis is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
