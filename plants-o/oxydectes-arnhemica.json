    "intro": "Oxydectes arnhemica, commonly known as the Arnhem rock fig, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the rugged landscapes of northern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by edible, round fruits resembling small figs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Oxydectes arnhemica is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its resilience to harsh climatic conditions."
