    "intro": "Ornithogalum foetidum, commonly known as the stink bell, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its bulbous root system and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. It is named for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is released when the flowers open. This species is often found in grassy areas and is adapted to dry, well-drained soils."
