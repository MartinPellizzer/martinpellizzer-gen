    "intro": "Ophrys liburnica, commonly known as the Liburnian bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and meadows. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insect genitalia. Ophrys liburnica is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, often with a single or few blooms per inflorescence."
