    "intro": "Oxytropis lydiae, commonly known as Lydia's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
