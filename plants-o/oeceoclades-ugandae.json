    "intro": "Oeceoclades ugandae, commonly known as the Uganda spiral orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the montane forests of Uganda. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically pale green with a yellowish hue. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, Oeceoclades ugandae is considered a vulnerable species."
