    "intro": "Opuntia atroglobosa, commonly known as the black globose prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its globose, spiny stems that are typically dark green to black in color. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its thick, waxy cuticle helps it retain water in arid environments. Opuntia atroglobosa is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant in desert ecosystems."
