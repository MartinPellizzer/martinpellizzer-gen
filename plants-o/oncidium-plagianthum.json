    "intro": "Oncidium plagianthum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescence that bears clusters of bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Oncidium plagianthum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
