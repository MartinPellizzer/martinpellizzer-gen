    "intro": "Oncidium longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved orchid, is a tropical orchid species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with prominent red or orange markings. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Oncidium longifolium is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms."
