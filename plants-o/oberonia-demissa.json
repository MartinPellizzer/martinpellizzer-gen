    "intro": "Oberonia demissa, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a species of flowering plant in the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia, including parts of Borneo and Sumatra. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, Oberonia demissa is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
