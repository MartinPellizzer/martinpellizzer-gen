    "intro": "Ophrys tabanifera, commonly known as the horsefly orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower that mimics the appearance of a female horsefly, a feature that aids in its unique pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown in color, with intricate patterns that resemble the wings of its pollinator. Ophrys tabanifera is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, leafy stem and produces a single or few flowers per stem."
