    "intro": "Opuntia leucacantha var. subferox, commonly known as the Mexican devil's tongue, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, spine-tipped pads and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with succulent stems that store water and reduce transpiration. Its spines provide protection from herbivores, while its shallow root system allows it to absorb moisture from the soil efficiently. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in harsh climates."
