    "intro": "Oxydectes sclerocalyx, commonly known as the rock fig, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are adapted to arid conditions, helping to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, round fig-like structure that turns red when ripe. Oxydectes sclerocalyx is often used in rock gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
