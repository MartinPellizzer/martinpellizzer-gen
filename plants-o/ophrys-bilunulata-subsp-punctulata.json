    "intro": "Ophrys bilunulata subsp. punctulata, commonly known as the spotted bee orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with a distinctive pattern of spots and a prominent lip. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. This subspecies is known for its specialized pollination mechanism and is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
