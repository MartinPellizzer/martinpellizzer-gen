    "intro": "Oenanthe peucedanifolia var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate hogweed, is a biennial or perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features tall, hollow stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are large, deeply lobed, and can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, which bloom in late summer. It is part of the carrot family (Apiaceae) and contains phototoxic compounds that can cause skin irritation upon exposure to sunlight. Due to its resemblance to other toxic plants, it is often mistaken for more dangerous species and requires careful identification."
