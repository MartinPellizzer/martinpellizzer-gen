    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. nigrouncinata, commonly known as black rice, is a variety of rice characterized by its dark, almost black, grain color due to high levels of anthocyanin pigments. This variety is native to Southeast Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental and nutritional value. The grains are typically longer and slender compared to other rice varieties, with a firm texture when cooked. It is rich in antioxidants, fiber, and essential nutrients, making it a valuable addition to a healthy diet. The plant grows as an annual herb with erect stems and produces panicles of small, greenish flowers that develop into the characteristic black grains."
