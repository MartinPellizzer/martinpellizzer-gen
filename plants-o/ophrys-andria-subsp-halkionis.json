    "intro": "Ophrys andria subsp. halkionis, commonly known as the Halkionis orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils in woodland or shrubland habitats. It produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive lip that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
