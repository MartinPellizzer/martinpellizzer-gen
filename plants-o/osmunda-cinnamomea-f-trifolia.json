    "intro": "Osmunda cinnamomea f. trifolia, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds and spore-bearing structures. It features a tall, slender, cinnamon-colored fiddlehead that unfurls into a bipinnate frond with a broad, triangular shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are robust and form dense clumps, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in specialized structures called sori, which are clustered along the veins."
