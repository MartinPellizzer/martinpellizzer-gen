    "intro": "Ononis arvensis var. spinescens, commonly known as the spiny field catchfly, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and reaches a height of about 20 to 60 centimeters. The plant features slender, branching stems covered with stiff, spiny hairs, which give it its common name. Its small, pinkish-white flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. This variety is often found in dry, open habitats and is relatively drought-tolerant."
