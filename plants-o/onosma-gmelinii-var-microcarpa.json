    "intro": "Onosma gmelinii var. microcarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited onosma, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy foliage. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This variety is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens."
