    "intro": "Ophrys cornuta var. elbursana, commonly known as the Elburs horned orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Elburs Mountains in Iran. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which features a distinctive horn-like projection on the lip, aiding in mimicry of female wasps to attract male pollinators. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns that enhance its deceptive appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
