It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, rolled leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
