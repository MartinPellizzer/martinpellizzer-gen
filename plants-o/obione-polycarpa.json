    "intro": "Obione polycarpa, commonly known as the many-fruited obione, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces multiple fruits, each containing several seeds, which contribute to its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
