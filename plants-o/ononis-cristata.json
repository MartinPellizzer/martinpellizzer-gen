    "intro": "Ononis cristata, commonly known as the crested bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces tiny, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands, rocky soils, and disturbed areas. Ononis cristata is often used in traditional herbal medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
