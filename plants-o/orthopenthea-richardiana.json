    "intro": "Orthopenthea richardiana, commonly known as the Richard's orthopenthea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces capsules as its fruit, which contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern. Its botanical study is important for understanding the biodiversity of Andean flora."
