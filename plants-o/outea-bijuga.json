    "intro": "Outea bijuga, commonly known as the Brazilian white cedar, is a deciduous tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Myristicaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by oval, woody fruits containing single seeds. Outea bijuga is valued for its durable, lightweight wood, which has been traditionally used for construction and furniture. Its ecological importance lies in providing habitat and food for various rainforest species."
