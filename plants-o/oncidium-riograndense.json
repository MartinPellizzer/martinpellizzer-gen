It is characterized by its pendulous, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are strap-like and often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. Oncidium riograndense prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
