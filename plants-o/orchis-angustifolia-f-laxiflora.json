    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia f. laxiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid in its laxiflora form, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and delicate, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is typically found in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows, where it thrives in the presence of mycorrhizal fungi. Its flowers are often clustered in racemes and have a distinctive, elongated shape. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
