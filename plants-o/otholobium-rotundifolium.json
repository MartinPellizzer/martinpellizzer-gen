    "intro": "Otholobium rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaf burr medic, is a perennial legume native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rounded, leathery leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species for dry climates. Its seeds are encased in a hairy, spiny pod, which aids in seed dispersal. Otholobium rotundifolium is often used in forage systems due to its nutritional value for livestock."
