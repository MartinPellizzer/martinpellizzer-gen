    "intro": "Oreogrammitis cheesemanii, commonly known as the Cheeseman's wall-rush, is a rare fern that thrives in specific ecological niches. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that typically grow in dense clusters on rocky or shaded substrates. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a short, creeping rhizome and small, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. It is native to New Zealand and is found primarily in the South Island, particularly in alpine and subalpine regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oreogrammitis cheesemanii is considered a vulnerable species."
