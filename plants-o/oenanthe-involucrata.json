    "intro": "Oenanthe involucrata, commonly known as the blue cohosh, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, blue-violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported tonic properties. The berries, which appear in late summer, are orange-red and contain toxic compounds, making the plant potentially dangerous if ingested."
