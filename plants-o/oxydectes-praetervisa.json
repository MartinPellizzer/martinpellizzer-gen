    "intro": "Oxydectes praetervisa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive, intricate structure. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many regions."
