    "intro": "Oncidium truncatum, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its clustered, pendulous inflorescences that bear numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, white, and green. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention. Oncidium truncatum is a pseudobulbous orchid, meaning it has thickened stems that store water and nutrients. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
