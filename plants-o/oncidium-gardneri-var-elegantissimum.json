    "intro": "Oncidium gardneri var. elegantissimum, commonly known as the Elegant Oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, fragrant flowers that come in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often with a contrasting lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs are segmented and store water, aiding in its survival in seasonal environments. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil with regular watering during the growing season."
