    "intro": "Othonna laureola, commonly known as the silver leaf othonna, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, silver-gray foliage with a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and containers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, requiring well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
