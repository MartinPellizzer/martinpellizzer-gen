    "intro": "Ornus cappadocica, commonly known as the Cappadocian ornus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by orange to red berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Ornus cappadocica is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
