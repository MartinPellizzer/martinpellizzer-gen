    "intro": "Ortachne retorta, commonly known as the twisted grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often twisted or coiled, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical cluster of spikelets, which are covered in fine hairs. Ortachne retorta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
