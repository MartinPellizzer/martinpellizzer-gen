    "intro": "Orchis rigida, commonly known as rigid orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are spurred at the base, a distinctive feature of the orchid family, and it produces small, dark brown seeds in pods. Orchis rigida is also known for its ecological importance, supporting various pollinators and serving as an indicator of healthy, undisturbed habitats."
