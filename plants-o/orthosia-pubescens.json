    "intro": "Orthosia pubescens, commonly known as the hairy orthosia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its yellow flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Orthosia pubescens is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments."
