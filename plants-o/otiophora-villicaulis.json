    "intro": "Otiophora villicaulis, commonly known as the silky haircup, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors. Its inflorescence consists of small, clustered spikes that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Otiophora villicaulis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native range."
