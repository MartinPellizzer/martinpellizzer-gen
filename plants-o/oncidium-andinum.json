    "intro": "Oncidium andinum, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting flowers that come in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Oncidium andinum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
