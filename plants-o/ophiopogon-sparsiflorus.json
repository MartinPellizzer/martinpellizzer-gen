    "intro": "Ophiopogon sparsiflorus, commonly known as the sparseflower lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Ophiopogon sparsiflorus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
