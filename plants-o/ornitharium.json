    "intro": "Ornitharium, commonly known as the bird garden, is a unique botanical structure that mimics a natural avian habitat. It typically features a variety of plants that provide shelter, food, and nesting sites for birds. The vegetation includes native shrubs, trees, and flowering plants that support local bird species. These plants are often selected for their ability to thrive in specific climates and soil conditions. The botanical design of an ornitharium emphasizes biodiversity and ecological balance."
