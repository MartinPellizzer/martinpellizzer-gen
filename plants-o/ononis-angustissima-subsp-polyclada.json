    "intro": "Ononis angustissima subsp. polyclada, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It typically features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its root system is extensive and adapted for nutrient uptake in poor soils. It is often found in rocky habitats and is valued for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
