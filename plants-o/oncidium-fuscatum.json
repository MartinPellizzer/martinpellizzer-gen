    "intro": "Oncidium fuscatum, commonly known as the dark orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features a sympodial growth habit with a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. Its roots are epiphytic, allowing it to grow on trees in its natural habitat. Oncidium fuscatum requires bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
