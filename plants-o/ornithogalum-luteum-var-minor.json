It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of yellow, star-shaped flowers during the spring and summer months. The plant is characterized by its underground bulbous stem, which serves as a storage organ for nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
