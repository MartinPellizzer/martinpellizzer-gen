    "intro": "Oxalis mutabilis, commonly known as the variable wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which resemble those of clover, and its delicate, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Oxalis mutabilis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in garden settings."
