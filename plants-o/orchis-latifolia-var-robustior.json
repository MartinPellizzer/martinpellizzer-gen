    "intro": "Orchis latifolia var. robustior, commonly known as the broad-leaved orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features a robust stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often adorned with showy, violet-blue flowers clustered in a loose spike. The leaves are broad and lance-shaped, typically arranged in a basal rosette, and the plant has a fibrous root system. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. This orchid is known for its ability to form mycorrhizal associations, which aid in nutrient uptake from the soil."
