    "intro": "Oxalis salticola, commonly known as the jumping bean plant, is a species native to South America. It is a flowering plant in the family Oxalidaceae, characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spherical seed pods that contain seeds with a unique ability to \"jump\" when disturbed, a trait that gives it its common name. Oxalis salticola thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Its botanical features make it a fascinating subject for both horticultural and scientific study."
