    "intro": "Ophrys holosericea subsp. lorenae, commonly known as the Lorena's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
