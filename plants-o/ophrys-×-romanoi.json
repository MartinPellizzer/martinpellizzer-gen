It is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera, the bee orchid, and Ophrys insectifera, the wasp orchid, resulting in a blend of traits from both parents. The plant is known for its intricate flower structure, which mimics the appearance of female insects to attract male pollinators. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with intricate patterns that resemble insect bodies, aiding in pollination through mimicry. This orchid thrives in specific habitats, often found in calcareous soils across southern Europe."
