    "intro": "Olearia stellulata var. lirata, commonly known as the silverweed daisy, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It features silvery, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance, and its flowers are typically white or pale blue, arranged in clusters. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators. However, it is considered invasive in some regions outside its native range."
