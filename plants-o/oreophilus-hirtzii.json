    "intro": "Oreophilus hirtzii, commonly known as the hairy oreophilus, is a rare and specialized plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically at elevations above 1,500 meters, where it requires cool, moist conditions. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid mountain habitat. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Oreophilus hirtzii is considered a conservation concern."
