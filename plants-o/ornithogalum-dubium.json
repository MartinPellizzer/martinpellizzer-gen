    "intro": "Ornithogalum dubium, commonly known as the doubtful star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. The plant is characterized by its bulbous underground stem, which serves as a storage organ for nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes."
