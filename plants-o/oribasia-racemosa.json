    "intro": "Oribasia racemosa, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and its leaves are usually gray-green with a fuzzy texture. Oribasia racemosa has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions, and it produces small, round, spiny fruits that contain seeds. It is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
