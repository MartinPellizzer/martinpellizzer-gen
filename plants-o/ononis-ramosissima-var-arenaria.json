    "intro": "Ononis ramosissima var. arenaria, commonly known as sandrocket, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and sandy environments. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in loose, sandy soils. Sandrocket is often found in coastal dunes, gravelly slopes, and other harsh, well-drained habitats."
