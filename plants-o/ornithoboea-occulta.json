    "intro": "Ornithoboea occulta, commonly known as the hidden bird's-beak, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, also known as the legume or bean family, and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated seed pods. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, pale yellow flowers are followed by narrow, curved seed pods that resemble a bird's beak, giving it its common name. Ornithoboea occulta is often found in coastal or mountainous regions where it thrives in well-drained soil conditions."
