    "intro": "Ophrys oestrifera, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive flower structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually a mix of brown, yellow, and green, with a prominent lip that resembles a bee's body. Ophrys oestrifera is a perennial herb that produces showy blooms from late spring to early summer."
