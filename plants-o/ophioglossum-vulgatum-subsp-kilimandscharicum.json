    "intro": "Ophioglossum vulgatum subsp. kilimandscharicum, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species native to East Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often dark green, leathery leaves that resemble a tongue. The plant produces sporangia in clusters at the base of its leaves, which are typically surrounded by a specialized structure called a sorus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
