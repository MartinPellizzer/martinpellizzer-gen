    "intro": "Octomeria apiculata, commonly known as the rock fig, is a small shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fleshy fruits that are typically yellow or red in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
