    "intro": "Oberonia flava, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers and is often found in lowland forests. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually dark green and leathery, adapted to conserve moisture. Oberonia flava is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
