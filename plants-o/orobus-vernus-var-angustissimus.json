    "intro": "Orobus vernus var. angustissimus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or reddish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a slender, branched stem and small, scale-like leaves that are often obscured by its floral structures. It typically parasitizes grasses and other herbaceous plants, growing in open, disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. Due to its lack of photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem as a specialized parasite."
