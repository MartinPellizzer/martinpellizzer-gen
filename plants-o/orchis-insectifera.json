    "intro": "Orchis insectifera, commonly known as the insect orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble insects, a trait that likely evolved as a form of mimicry to attract pollinators. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are usually purple or violet in color, with a distinctive lip that mimics the appearance of an insect. Orchis insectifera is known for its specialized pollination mechanisms, relying on specific insects for reproduction."
