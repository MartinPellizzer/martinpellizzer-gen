    "intro": "Ornithidium tafallae, commonly known as the Tafalla fern, is a rare and distinctive member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a slightly serrated edge. Native to the humid forests of the Iberian Peninsula, this plant thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its reproductive structures, including small, clustered sporangia, are located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ornithidium tafallae is considered a conservation concern."
