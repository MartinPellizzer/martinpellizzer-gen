    "intro": "Oxytropis viscida subsp. hudsonica, commonly known as Hudson's sticky locoweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, glandular hair covering its stems and leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, arranged in dense clusters. It has a deep taproot system, which allows it to thrive in dry, rocky habitats. This subspecies is noted for its sticky secretions, which can deter herbivores and aid in seed dispersal."
