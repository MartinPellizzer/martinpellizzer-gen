    "intro": "Opuntia neoargentina, commonly known as the Argentine prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and are often ribbed. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which are followed by edible, fruit-like structures called tunas. Opuntia neoargentina is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it highly drought-resistant. It is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in some regions."
