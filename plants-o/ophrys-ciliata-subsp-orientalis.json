    "intro": "Ophrys ciliata subsp. orientalis, commonly known as the eastern beard orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait known as pseudocopulation. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by male bees. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its specific ecological requirements and limited distribution."
