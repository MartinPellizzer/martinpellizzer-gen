    "intro": "Oenothera ammophiloides var. flecticaulis, commonly known as the bent-stem evening primrose, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often bent stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments and a valuable species for ecological studies."
