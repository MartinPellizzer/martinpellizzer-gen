    "intro": "Oreostemma andersonii, commonly known as the Anderson's oreostemma, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Onagraceae family, which includes willows and evening primroses, and is characterized by its small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. Its unique morphology includes ascending stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of white to pale pink flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
