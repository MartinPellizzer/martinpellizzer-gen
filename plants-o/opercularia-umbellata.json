    "intro": "Opercularia umbellata, commonly known as the umbrella lichen, is a foliose lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its bright green to yellowish thallus with a distinctive, umbrella-like shape, which gives it its common name. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and cyanobacteria, which contribute to its photosynthetic capabilities. It typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in humid, shaded environments. Opercularia umbellata is often found in temperate regions and is used as an indicator species for environmental health."
