    "intro": "Ononis natrix var. arenaria, commonly known as sand everlasting or sand bindweed, is a flowering plant native to sandy and coastal environments. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant has slender, creeping stems and small, elliptical leaves that are adapted to thrive in arid conditions. It produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its survival in sandy soils. This plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
