It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are usually narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing structural support for its climbing habit. Oberonia delicata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouse settings due to its specific care requirements."
