    "intro": "Oxytropis platysema, commonly known as the broad-leaved bur pea, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets and clusters of violet to purple flowers. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Oxytropis platysema is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment."
