    "intro": "Ochradenus minor, commonly known as the lesser oxytropis, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing, perennial shrub that typically reaches a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Ochradenus minor is often found in rocky soils and is considered an important component of steppe and desert ecosystems."
