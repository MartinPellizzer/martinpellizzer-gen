    "intro": "Osteospermum ecklonis, commonly known as the African daisy, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces a unique structure called a \"head\" composed of many small, tubular florets surrounded by ray florets. Osteospermum ecklonis thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its foliage is typically gray-green, and it is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive appearance and hardiness."
