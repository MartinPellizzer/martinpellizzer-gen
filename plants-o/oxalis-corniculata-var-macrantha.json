    "intro": "Oxalis corniculata var. macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped lobes and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with five petals. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and can spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some regions. The flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the morning and closing by midday."
