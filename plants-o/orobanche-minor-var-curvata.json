    "intro": "Orobanche minor var. curvata, commonly known as the dwarf broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of other plants such as grasses and legumes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its life cycle is closely tied to the seasonal availability of host plants, making it a transient and elusive species. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized flora in certain regions."
