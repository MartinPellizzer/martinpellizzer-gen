It features slender, branched stems that often grow from the base and are covered in fine, soft hairs. The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and have a slightly toothed margin, typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length. Small white to pale yellow flowers are arranged in umbrella-like clusters, blooming in late spring to early summer. This plant is adapted to moist soils and is often found in areas with standing water or saturated ground."
