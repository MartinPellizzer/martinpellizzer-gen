    "intro": "Odontoglossum crispum, commonly known as the curly lip orchid, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a herbaceous perennial orchid characterized by its striking, dark green leaves with a wavy, curly margin. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear clusters of fragrant, violet to purple flowers with a distinctive, lip-like structure. Odontoglossum crispum thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for both greenhouse cultivation and botanical collections."
