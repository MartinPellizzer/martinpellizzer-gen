    "intro": "Opuntia dimorpha, commonly known as the narrowleaf prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in small, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Opuntia dimorpha is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert wildlife."
