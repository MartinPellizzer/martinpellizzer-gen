    "intro": "Orthopogon undulatus, commonly known as the zigzag grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, undulating leaf blades that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. Orthopogon undulatus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
