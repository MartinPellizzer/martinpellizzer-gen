    "intro": "Oxytropis rhynchophysa, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, compound leaves and pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen, which enriches the soil and supports other plant life. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some areas."
