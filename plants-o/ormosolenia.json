    "intro": "Ormosolenia, commonly known as the \"flowering grass\" or \"southern grass,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, often tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense spikes. Ormosolenia species are often found in moist or wet habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas. They play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and microorganisms."
