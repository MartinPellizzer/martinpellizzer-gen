It features narrow, linear leaves that form a rosette near the ground. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
