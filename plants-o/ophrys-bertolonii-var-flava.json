    "intro": "Ophrys bertolonii var. flava, commonly known as the yellow bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow floral morphology, which closely resembles a female bee, an adaptation that aids in pollination by male bees. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers during the spring season. This orchid is part of the Ophrys genus, known for its mimicry strategies to attract specific pollinators."
