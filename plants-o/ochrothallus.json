    "intro": "Ochrothallus, commonly known as the yellow thallus lichen, is a type of lichen that exhibits unique botanical characteristics. It belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae and is distinguished by its yellowish to orange-colored thallus, which is composed of a fungal component and a photosynthetic algal partner. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead forming a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and an alga. Ochrothallus thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on decaying wood or rock surfaces. Its structure and coloration make it an important indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
