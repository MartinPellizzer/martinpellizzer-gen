    "intro": "Otopappus tequilanus var. acuminatus, commonly known as the Tequila thistle, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, silver-green foliage and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a compact growth habit and is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
