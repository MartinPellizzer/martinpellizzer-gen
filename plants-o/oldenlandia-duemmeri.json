    "intro": "Oldenlandia duemmeri, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist environments make it an important component of riparian ecosystems. However, it can also become invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
