    "intro": "Orchis mascula subsp. hispanica, commonly known as the Spanish twayblade, is a rare and specialized orchid found in southern Europe. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, leafless stem and a single, showy purple or violet flower. The plant is adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments, often in woodlands or along stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in many regions."
