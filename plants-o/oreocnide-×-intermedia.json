    "intro": "Oreocnide \u00d7 intermedia, commonly known as the hybrid evergreen shrub, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Oreocnide fruticosa and Oreocnide glabrescens. It is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of China, Vietnam, and Indonesia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features dense, leathery foliage with elliptical to ovate leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, berry-like fruits. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
