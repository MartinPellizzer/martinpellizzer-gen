    "intro": "Ourisia glabra, commonly known as the smooth ourisia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Ourisia glabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
