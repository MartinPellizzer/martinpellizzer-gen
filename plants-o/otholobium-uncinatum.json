    "intro": "Otholobium uncinatum, commonly known as the hooked otholobium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in coastal and sandy environments, often as a shrub or subshrub. Its small, compound leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, hooked pods that contain several seeds. Otholobium uncinatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
