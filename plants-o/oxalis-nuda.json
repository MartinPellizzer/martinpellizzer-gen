    "intro": "Oxalis nuda, commonly known as the naked wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves with three heart-shaped leaflets and small, yellow flowers that resemble those of true sorrel. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Oxalis nuda has a fibrous root system and can spread vegetatively through rhizomes. Its botanical name reflects its lack of stipules, which are absent in this species."
