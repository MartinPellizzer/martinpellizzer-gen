    "intro": "Oreocarya alata, commonly known as the winged buckthorn, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Chile. It is characterized by its distinctive winged branches and small, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in the spring, followed by small, fleshy berries that are edible for birds and other wildlife. Oreocarya alata thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its high-altitude habitat. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food for local fauna."
