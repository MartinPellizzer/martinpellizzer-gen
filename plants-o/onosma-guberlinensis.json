    "intro": "Onosma guberlinensis, commonly known as the Guberlin's skullcap, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
