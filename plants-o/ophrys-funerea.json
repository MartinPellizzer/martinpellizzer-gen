    "intro": "Ophrys funerea, commonly known as the funeral orchid, is a striking species of orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark, almost blackish-purple flowers that resemble human faces, a feature common in many Ophrys species. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are specialized for mimicry, often resembling female wasps to attract male pollinators. Ophrys funerea is a rare and protected species, with limited distribution across southern Europe."
