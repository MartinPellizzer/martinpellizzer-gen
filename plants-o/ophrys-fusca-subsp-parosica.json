    "intro": "Ophrys fusca subsp. parosica, commonly known as the Parosic orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a complex lip that mimics the appearance of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with intricate markings that aid in mimicry. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
