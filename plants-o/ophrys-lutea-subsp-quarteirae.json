    "intro": "Ophrys lutea subsp. quarteirae, commonly known as the yellow bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers with a distinct bee-like labellum, and its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. This subspecies is noted for its specialized pollination mechanism and is often found in Mediterranean climates."
