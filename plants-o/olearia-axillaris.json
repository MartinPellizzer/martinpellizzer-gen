    "intro": "Olearia axillaris, commonly known as the silverweed or coastal daisy, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, daisy-like white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to tolerate salt spray and strong winds. Olearia axillaris is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
