    "intro": "Orchis sambucina subsp. asturica, commonly known as the Asturian lady's tresses, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its distinctive, dark purple to brownish flowers arranged in a loose, loose raceme. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, highlighting its ecological specificity. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a protected species in several regions."
