    "intro": "Opuntia caribaea, commonly known as the Caribbean prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean region. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are often green and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers, followed by edible, fleshy fruits called tunas. Opuntia caribaea is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick stems. It plays a role in local ecosystems and has been used by indigenous peoples for food and traditional medicine."
