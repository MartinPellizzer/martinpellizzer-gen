    "intro": "Odontoglossum galianoi, commonly known as the Galiano's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking, dark green to purple foliage and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its flowers are often clustered in racemes and have a unique, spurred shape typical of the Odontoglossum genus. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
