    "intro": "Oreopanax farallonensis, commonly known as the Farallon Island sycamore, is a rare flowering plant native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is a member of the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and showy white flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, where it thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to the harsh maritime climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique species from threats such as habitat loss and invasive species."
