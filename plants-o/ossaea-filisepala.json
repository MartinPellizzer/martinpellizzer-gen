It belongs to the family Restionaceae, which includes many grass-like plants adapted to arid and coastal environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, thread-like sepals that give it its common name. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often appearing in spring or early summer. Ossaea filisepala is generally found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
