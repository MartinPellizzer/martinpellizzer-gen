    "intro": "Oenothera recurva, commonly known as the recurved evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, round seeds. Oenothera recurva is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is valued for its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
