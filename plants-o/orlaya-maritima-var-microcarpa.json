    "intro": "Orlaya maritima var. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited sea blush, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the eastern United States. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and pink to red flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are often used by birds and small mammals as a food source. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well adapted to sandy or muddy shores, where it thrives in brackish or saline conditions. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its coastal environment."
