It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, violet-blue flowers with distinctive yellow-green spots. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in mountainous regions, thriving in well-drained environments. Its pollination is primarily facilitated by specific bee species, highlighting its ecological niche. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
