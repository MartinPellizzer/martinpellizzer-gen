    "intro": "Opuntia davisii, commonly known as the Davis prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, spineless pads and vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its flowers are pollinated by various insects, including bees and moths, and the fruit, known as a tunas, is edible. Opuntia davisii plays an important role in its ecosystem, providing food and shelter for native wildlife."
