    "intro": "Oxalis stricta, commonly known as wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features trifoliate leaves, each leaflet resembling a heart shape, and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of yellow or white. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Oxalis stricta has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense mats."
