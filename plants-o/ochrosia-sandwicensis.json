    "intro": "Ochrosia sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian silver vine, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal areas and forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, reflective hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Ochrosia sandwicensis is considered an endangered species due to habitat loss and invasive species competition."
