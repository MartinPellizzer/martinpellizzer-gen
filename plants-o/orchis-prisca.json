    "intro": "Orchis prisca, commonly known as the ancient orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to parts of Europe. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and requires specific soil conditions to thrive. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it plays an important role in supporting local pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
