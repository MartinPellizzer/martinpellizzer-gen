    "intro": "Oldenlandia rupicola var. hirtula, commonly known as the hairy rock dodder, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its parasitic growth habit, attaching itself to host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. Its leaves are reduced to small scales, and it has a fibrous, creeping stem that can spread along rocky surfaces. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils."
