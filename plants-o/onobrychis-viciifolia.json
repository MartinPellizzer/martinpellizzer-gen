    "intro": "Onobrychis viciifolia, commonly known as sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. It is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Sainfoin also has historical uses in livestock feed and traditional medicine."
