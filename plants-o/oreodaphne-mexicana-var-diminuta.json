    "intro": "Oreodaphne mexicana var. diminuta, commonly known as the dwarf oreodaphne, is a small evergreen shrub native to parts of Mexico. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
