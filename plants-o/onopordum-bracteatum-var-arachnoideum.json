    "intro": "Onopordum bracteatum var. arachnoideum, commonly known as the spider-thistle, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, purplish stems and leaves covered in fine, hair-like structures that give it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically surrounded by bracts, which are modified leaves that often resemble petals. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
