    "intro": "Oreopanax oroyanus, commonly known as the Andean giant arrowleaf, is a striking plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a member of the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments at high elevations, often in cloud forests. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in its native habitat. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
