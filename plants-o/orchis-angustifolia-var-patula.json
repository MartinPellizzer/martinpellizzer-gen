    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia var. patula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows, often in temperate regions of Europe. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are pollinated by insects. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it lacks true leaves in the traditional sense, instead having reduced foliage. This orchid is a hemiparasitic species, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake."
