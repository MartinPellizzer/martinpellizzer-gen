    "intro": "Odontites serotinus var. paularensis, commonly known as the Paularensis Toothed Violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the violet family (Violaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, basal leaves and small, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky slopes. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. This variety is notable for its horticultural value and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
