It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its succulent, rounded leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, preferring well-drained soils and partial shade. Its flowers, which bloom in spring, are often pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
