    "intro": "Oreocharis hekouensis, commonly known as the Hekou oreocharis, is a rare flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, orchid-like flowers. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions with a humid climate, often in shaded forest understories. Its flowers are usually small and white or pale pink, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
