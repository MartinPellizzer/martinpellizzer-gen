    "intro": "Ophelia corymbosa var. elatior, commonly known as the greater water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands. The plant features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a distinctive white or pale pink flower cluster at the base of the stem. Its flowers are clustered in dense, showy inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is often used in water gardens and wetland restoration projects due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
