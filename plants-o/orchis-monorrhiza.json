    "intro": "Orchis monorrhiza, commonly known as the purple orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, bearing a single spike of violet to purple flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system and is often found in moist, calcareous soils in woodland areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant. Orchis monorrhiza is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism, relying on specific insects for reproduction."
