    "intro": "Oncidium uribei, commonly known as the Uribes orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, long-lasting blooms. The plant typically produces pendulous inflorescences with colorful, showy flowers that come in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Oncidium uribei is a pseudobulbous orchid, meaning it has thickened stems that store water and nutrients. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
