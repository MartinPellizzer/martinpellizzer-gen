    "intro": "Oncidium batemanianum, commonly known as the Bateman's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescence bearing numerous fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with white and purple markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers bloom in the spring and summer, and it thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light. Oncidium batemanianum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
