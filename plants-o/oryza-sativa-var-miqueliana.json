    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. miqueliana, commonly known as the Miquel rice, is a lesser-known variant of the rice species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and small, fragrant grains. The plant typically reaches a height of 1 to 1.5 meters and produces panicles that are often more compact compared to common rice varieties. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth, waxy surface. This variety is valued for its unique aroma and is sometimes cultivated for specialty rice markets."
