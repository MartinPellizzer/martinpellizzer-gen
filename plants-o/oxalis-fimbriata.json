    "intro": "Oxalis fimbriata, commonly known as the Fringed Wood Sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and its clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Oxalis fimbriata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in partial shade."
