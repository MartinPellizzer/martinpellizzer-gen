    "intro": "Ophiopogon kansuensis, commonly known as the Kansu lily, is a perennial herb native to China. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense mats. Ophiopogon kansuensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional Chinese medicine."
