    "intro": "Oreophylax, commonly known as the mountain grass, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, elongated leaves and small, clustered flowers. These plants are typically found in high-altitude environments, such as mountainous regions and alpine meadows. Oreophylax species are adapted to cold climates and often thrive in well-drained soils. Their ecological importance lies in their role as pioneer species in rocky and disturbed habitats."
