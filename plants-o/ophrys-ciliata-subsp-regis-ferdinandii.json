    "intro": "Ophrys ciliata subsp. regis-ferdinandii, commonly known as the King Ferdinand's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a pouch-like structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which is used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale greenish-yellow flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
