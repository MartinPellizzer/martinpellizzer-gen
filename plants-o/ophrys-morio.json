    "intro": "Ophrys morio, commonly known as the early bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive flower shape, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers bloom from late winter to early spring, making it one of the earliest orchids to appear in the spring season. The botanical structure of Ophrys morio includes a slender stem with a single or few racemes of flowers, each with a specialized labellum that mimics the appearance of an insect."
