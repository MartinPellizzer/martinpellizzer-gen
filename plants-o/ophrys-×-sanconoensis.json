    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 sanconoensis, commonly known as the Sanconensis Bee Orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure, which features a prominent, fuzzy lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a striking display of yellow and brown hues. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
