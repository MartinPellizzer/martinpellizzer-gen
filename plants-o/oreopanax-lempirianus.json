It is characterized by its large, compound leaves that are often arranged in a palmate pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an important species for ecological studies in its native range."
