    "intro": "Oenanthe globulosa, commonly known as globular water dropwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, globular inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along stream banks and wet meadows. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, round fruits. Oenanthe globulosa is often found in riparian habitats and is considered a characteristic species of wetland vegetation."
