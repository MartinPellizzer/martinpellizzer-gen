    "intro": "Ononis pendula var. penduliflora, commonly known as the hanging sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features small, fleshy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers that hang downward, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
