    "intro": "Oncostylis junciformis var. ambigua, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a perennial herb native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Its flowers are usually green or brown, and it is often found in swampy areas or along riverbanks. This variant is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical form of Oncostylis junciformis."
