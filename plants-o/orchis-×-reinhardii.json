It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, particularly in regions such as Germany and the Czech Republic. The plant produces striking violet or purple flowers with a distinctive lip that is often marked with dark spots. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The hybrid exhibits characteristics of both parent species, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
