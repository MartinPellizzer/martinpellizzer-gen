    "intro": "Orchis sagittata, commonly known as the arrowhead orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves and delicate, often pale purple or white flowers. The plant typically grows in woodland or meadow habitats, preferring moist, well-drained soil. It is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, usually in late spring or early summer. The orchid has a complex relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological significance."
