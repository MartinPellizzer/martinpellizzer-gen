    "intro": "Ostodes integrifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that are entire, meaning they have no notches or teeth along the edges. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. Its fronds are floating, with the lower portion submerged, allowing it to absorb nutrients from the water. Ostodes integrifolia plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water quality through nutrient cycling."
