    "intro": "Otholobium sabulosum, commonly known as the coastal burr bush, is a small shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its wiry, thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces fluffy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in winter, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a burr-like structure that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals. Otholobium sabulosum is typically found in sandy or rocky coastal areas and is adapted to withstand harsh, saline conditions."
