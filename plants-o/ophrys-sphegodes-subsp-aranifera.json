    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes subsp. aranifera, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive flower structure, which closely resembles a bee, aiding in its pollination by male bees. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of a bee's body. The subspecies aranifera is distinguished by its specific morphological features, including the shape and coloration of its floral pouch."
