    "intro": "Oxytropis glabra var. salina, commonly known as saltbush or saltbriar, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and saline environments. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant is adapted to high salinity and poor soils, making it a common species in desert and coastal regions. Its deep root system allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, enhancing its drought tolerance. Oxytropis glabra var. salina plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats."
