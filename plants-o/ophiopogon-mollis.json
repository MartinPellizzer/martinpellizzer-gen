    "intro": "Ophiopogon mollis, commonly known as the Japanese forest grass, is a perennial evergreen herb native to East Asia. It features dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, dark green leaves that form a low, carpet-like growth. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in ornamental landscaping for its attractive foliage and ease of maintenance. Ophiopogon mollis is also valued for its ability to tolerate a variety of soil conditions and its role in ecological restoration projects."
