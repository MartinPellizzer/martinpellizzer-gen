    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered sandalwood, is a flowering plant species native to Southeast Asia. It is a small shrub that typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, often found in mangrove and tropical forest ecosystems. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in pairs, giving it its common name. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Ophiorrhiza biflora is also known for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
