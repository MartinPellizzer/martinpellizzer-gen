    "intro": "Onopordum carduiforme subsp. blancheanum, commonly known as the Blancheanum thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. It has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller and more rounded leaves compared to the typical form of *Onopordum carduiforme*."
