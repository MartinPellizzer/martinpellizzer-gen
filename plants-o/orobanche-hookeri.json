    "intro": "Orobanche hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its showy, often pink or purple, flowers. The plant typically attaches itself to the roots of grasses or other herbaceous plants, forming a symbiotic relationship. Its life cycle involves germinating in the absence of light and establishing a connection with a host plant's root system. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host species."
