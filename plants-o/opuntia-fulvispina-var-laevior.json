    "intro": "Opuntia fulvispina var. laevior, commonly known as the smooth spineless prickly pear, is a cacti species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red or orange fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, though this variety has reduced spines compared to other Opuntia species. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
