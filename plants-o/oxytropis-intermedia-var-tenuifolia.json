    "intro": "Oxytropis intermedia var. tenuifolia, commonly known as slenderleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant has slender, hairy stems and small, compound leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its flowers are usually pale blue to purple, arranged in racemes, and bloom in late spring to early summer. The species is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia, contributing to soil fertility in arid environments."
