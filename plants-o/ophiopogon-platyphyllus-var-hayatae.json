    "intro": "Ophiopogon platyphyllus var. hayatae, commonly known as the Japanese forest grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Japan. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense, mat-like foliage, often with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers in late summer, followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in partial to full shade and is well-suited for woodland gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value lies in its attractive foliage and ability to create a lush, natural appearance in shaded landscapes."
