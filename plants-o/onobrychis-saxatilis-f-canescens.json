    "intro": "Onobrychis saxatilis f. canescens, commonly known as the grey-leaved clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and arid regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, trifoliate leaves that are covered in a fine, greyish pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in limestone habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
