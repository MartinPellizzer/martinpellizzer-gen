    "intro": "Ornithocephalus dusenianus, commonly known as the Dusen's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, showy blooms that often feature a mix of white, pink, and purple hues. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions with partial shade. Its unique floral structure includes a specialized lip that aids in pollination by specific insects. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
