    "intro": "Ornithogalum rupestre, commonly known as the rock onion or mountain garlic, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale green flowers. The plant is adapted to rocky and arid environments, often growing in well-drained soils. Its bulbous stem stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and moths, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat."
