    "intro": "Odontarrhena pateri subsp. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate odontarrhena, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its creeping stems that lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered with fine hairs to reduce water loss. This subspecies is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystem."
