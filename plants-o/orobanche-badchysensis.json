    "intro": "Orobanche badchysensis, commonly known as the Kashmir ghostflower, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, often pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, where it can establish itself on a variety of host species. Its life cycle involves germinating in the absence of light and attaching to host roots through specialized structures called haustoria. Due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements, Orobanche badchysensis is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
