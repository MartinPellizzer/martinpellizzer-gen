    "intro": "Oxytropis lithophila, commonly known as the rock hopper vetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and slender, branched stems. The plant typically grows on rocky slopes and gravelly soils, showing adaptations to drought and poor nutrient conditions. Its leaves are often trifoliate, and it produces small, hard pods that contain seeds. Oxytropis lithophila plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
