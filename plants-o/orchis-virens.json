    "intro": "Orchis virens, commonly known as the green-winged orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in moist, calcareous habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf that is often reddish at the base. Its flowers are arranged in a loose spike, with pale green to yellowish petals and sepals, and a distinctive, hairy labellum. Orchis virens is notable for its ability to form mycorrhizal associations, which aid in nutrient uptake from the soil."
