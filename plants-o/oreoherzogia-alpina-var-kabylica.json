    "intro": "Oreoherzogia alpina var. kabylica, commonly known as the Kabylica snowbell, is a rare alpine plant native to the high mountain regions of Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats at elevations above 2,000 meters. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces a cluster of flowers at the top of its slender stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
