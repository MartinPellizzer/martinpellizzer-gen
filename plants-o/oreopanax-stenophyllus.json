It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its compound, pinnate leaves that are typically narrow and leathery. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries that are a source of food for various animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
