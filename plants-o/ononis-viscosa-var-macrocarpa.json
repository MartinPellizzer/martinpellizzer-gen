    "intro": "Ononis viscosa var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces elongated, hairy pods that contain several seeds. The variety macrocarpa is distinguished by its larger, more robust fruits compared to the typical form of Ononis viscosa."
