    "intro": "Orobanche amethystea var. henriquesii, commonly known as the purple broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its highly reduced, often showy flowers. The plant typically grows in Mediterranean climates and is often found parasitizing species of the genus Astragalus. Its flowers are usually pink to purple in color, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem, influencing the growth and distribution of its host plants."
