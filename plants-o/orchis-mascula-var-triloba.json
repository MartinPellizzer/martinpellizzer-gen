    "intro": "Orchis mascula var. triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed male orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a deep purple or violet color with intricate patterns. The plant has a tall, erect stem with several leaves and produces clusters of flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
