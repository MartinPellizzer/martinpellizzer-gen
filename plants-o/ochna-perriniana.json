    "intro": "Ochna perriniana, commonly known as the African velvetwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and striking yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain smooth, black seeds. Ochna perriniana is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-resistant. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber due to its hard, durable wood."
