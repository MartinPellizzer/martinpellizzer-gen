    "intro": "Ophrys polyxo, commonly known as the Polyxo bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower structure, which features a hairy, yellowish-green labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a delicate, fragrant scent to attract pollinators. Ophrys polyxo is a protected species in many areas due to habitat loss and over-collection."
