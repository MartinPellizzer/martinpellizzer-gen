    "intro": "Oenothera media, commonly known as the evening primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It is characterized by its showy, yellow or orange flowers that open in the evening, hence its common name. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, oily seeds. Oenothera media thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in prairies and open woodlands. It is also valued for its medicinal properties due to the high content of essential fatty acids in its seeds."
