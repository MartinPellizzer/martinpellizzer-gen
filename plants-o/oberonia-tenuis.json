    "intro": "Oberonia tenuis, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It typically grows on tree trunks or branches, relying on its host for physical support rather than nutrients. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the wet season. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Oberonia tenuis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by enthusiasts of rare orchids."
