    "intro": "Oxytropis lagopus var. conjugans, commonly known as the hoary vetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is a perennial legume characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being narrow and slightly hairy. The species is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
