    "intro": "Oenocarpus circumtextus, commonly known as the breadnut tree, is a tropical species native to Central and South America. It is a large, evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a dense canopy and smooth, grayish-brown bark. The plant produces large, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, and its fruit is a hard, spiny capsule containing edible seeds. The seeds, known as breadnuts, are rich in oil and have been used traditionally for food and oil extraction. Its botanical features make it an important species in tropical ecosystems and agroforestry systems."
