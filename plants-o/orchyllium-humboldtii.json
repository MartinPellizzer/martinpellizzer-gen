    "intro": "Orchyllium humboldtii, commonly known as Humboldt's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Andean highlands of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine soils, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its unique morphology includes a slender stem and a single, showy flower that blooms during the cooler months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Orchyllium humboldtii is considered a species of conservation concern."
