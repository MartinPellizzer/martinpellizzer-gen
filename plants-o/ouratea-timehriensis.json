    "intro": "Ouratea timehriensis, commonly known as the Brazilian beautyberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, simple, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer months. Following flowering, it develops small, round, purple-black berries that are edible but have a mild, slightly bitter taste. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a compact, shade-tolerant plant."
