    "intro": "Ophrys transhyrcana subsp. paphlagonica, commonly known as the Paphlagonian bee orchid, is a rare orchid species native to parts of Turkey and the Caucasus. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils in open, sunny habitats. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
