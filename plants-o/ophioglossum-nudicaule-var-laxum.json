    "intro": "Ophioglossum nudicaule var. laxum, commonly known as the loose-stemmed adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species belonging to the Ophioglossaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often arching fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, club-shaped sporangia along the underside of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, humus-filled soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
