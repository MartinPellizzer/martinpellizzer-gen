    "intro": "Onobrychis kurdica, commonly known as Kurdish clover, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant is adapted to dry and rocky soils, making it a hardy species in arid environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility. Its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils have made it a subject of interest in ecological and horticultural studies."
