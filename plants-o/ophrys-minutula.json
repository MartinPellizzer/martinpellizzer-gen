    "intro": "Ophrys minutula, commonly known as the small bee orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance of a small bee, a feature that aids in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Ophrys minutula is a protected species in several countries due to habitat loss and over-collection."
