    "intro": "Orobanche wiedemannii, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is found in various regions of Europe, Asia, and Africa, often growing on the roots of legumes and other herbaceous plants. The plant produces small, pale yellow or white flowers and has a unique root system composed of haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It plays a role in ecological systems by influencing host plant populations and soil nutrient dynamics. Due to its parasitic nature, it can be a challenge for agricultural crops, particularly in regions where it is invasive."
