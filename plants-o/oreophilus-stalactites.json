    "intro": "Oreophilus stalactites, commonly known as mineral deposits in cave systems, are geological formations rather than botanical entities. They are composed primarily of calcium carbonate and form through the slow deposition of mineral-rich water. These structures are not living organisms and do not exhibit plant-like characteristics such as growth through photosynthesis. Instead, they grow through chemical precipitation in subterranean environments. While they are often found in association with cave ecosystems, they play a crucial role in shaping the physical structure of caves."
