    "intro": "Orobanche diaphana, commonly known as the pale broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of various flowering plants. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
