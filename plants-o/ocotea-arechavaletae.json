    "intro": "Ocotea arechavaletae, commonly known as the Ecuadorian ocotea, is a species of flowering plant in the Lauraceae family. It is native to the Andean regions of Ecuador and is characterized by its aromatic, evergreen leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within cloud forests, where it thrives in the cooler, humid climate. Its bark and leaves contain essential oils, which have been used in traditional medicine for their purported therapeutic properties. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
