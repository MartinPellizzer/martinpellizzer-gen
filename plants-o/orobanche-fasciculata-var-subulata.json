    "intro": "Orobanche fasciculata var. subulata, commonly known as the slender dwarf broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of various flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in summer. It is native to regions of the Mediterranean and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
