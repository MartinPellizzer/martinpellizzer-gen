    "intro": "Orchis barbata, commonly known as the hairy twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stem and two opposite lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single spike of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often overlooked due to their muted color. Orchis barbata is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient uptake."
