    "intro": "Odontarrhena eriophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is adapted to store water, enabling it to survive prolonged dry periods. Odontarrhena eriophylla is often found in sandy soils and is an important component of local ecosystems in its native range."
