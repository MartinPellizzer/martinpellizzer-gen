    "intro": "Ononis natrix subsp. mauritii, commonly known as the Mauritius bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
