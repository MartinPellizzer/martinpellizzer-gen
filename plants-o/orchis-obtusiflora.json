    "intro": "Orchis obtusiflora, commonly known as the blunt-flowered orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland areas and thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. Its flowers are bilaterally symmetric, with three sepals and three petals, one of which is prominently hooded. Orchis obtusiflora plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies due to its nectar-rich blooms."
