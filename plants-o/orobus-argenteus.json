    "intro": "Orobus argenteus, commonly known as silverweed, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a sprawling growth habit with silver-gray leaves that have a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and often form dense colonies, making it a persistent weed in disturbed soils. Orobus argenteus is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy, or rocky environments."
