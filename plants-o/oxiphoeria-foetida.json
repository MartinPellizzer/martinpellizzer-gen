    "intro": "Oxiphoeria foetida, commonly known as the stinking nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is native to parts of Africa and is characterized by its dark green, ovate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces berries that are initially green and turn red when mature, though they are toxic and should not be consumed. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its strong, unpleasant odor, it is sometimes referred to as the \"smelly nightshade.\""
