It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant has hairy, silver-green leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow and bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Osvaldoa valida is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats."
