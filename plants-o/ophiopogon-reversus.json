    "intro": "Ophiopogon reversus, commonly known as the reverse spike grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and clusters of small, pale green to white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, while its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Ophiopogon reversus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
