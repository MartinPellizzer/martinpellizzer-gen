    "intro": "Oxalis eggersii, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves that resemble those of common oxalis species. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to rocky soils and full sunlight. It produces small, green, three-lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Oxalis eggersii is typically found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it blooms in spring and early summer."
