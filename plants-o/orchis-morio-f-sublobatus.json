    "intro": "Orchis morio f. sublobatus, commonly known as the sublobate marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in wet meadows and marshy habitats. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive pinkish-purple flowers with a prominent lip. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense, woolly coating. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this orchid is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
