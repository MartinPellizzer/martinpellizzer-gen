    "intro": "Otatea carrilloi, commonly known as the Carrillo's otatea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae, native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is a small to medium-sized palm characterized by its slender trunk and pinnate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by small, round fruits. Otatea carrilloi is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along riverbanks, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in botanical gardens and as a houseplant in certain regions."
