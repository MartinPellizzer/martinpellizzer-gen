    "intro": "Opuntia coccinea, commonly known as the red prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in sharp spines and woolly areoles. The plant produces vibrant red flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, orange-colored fruits. Its leaves are modified into flat, paddle-shaped stems, a common adaptation in cacti for reducing water loss. Opuntia coccinea is also notable for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy pads, allowing it to thrive in arid environments."
