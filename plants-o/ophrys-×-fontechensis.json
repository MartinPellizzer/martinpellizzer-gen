    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 fontechensis, commonly known as the Fontecheche orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the genus Ophrys, which is characterized by its mimicry of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant produces intricate, bee-like flowers with a specialized structure called a labellum, which plays a key role in its pollination strategy. It thrives in rocky and woodland habitats, preferring cool, moist environments. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
