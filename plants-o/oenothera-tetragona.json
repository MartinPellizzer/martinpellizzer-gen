    "intro": "Oenothera tetragona, commonly known as the four-angle evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Oenothera tetragona is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly moths and beetles."
