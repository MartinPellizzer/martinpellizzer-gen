    "intro": "Otiophora scabra subsp. diffusa, commonly known as the rough-stemmed rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous or coastal areas. The plant features wiry, often hairy stems and small, pinnately divided leaves that are usually covered in fine pubescence. Its flowers are white or pale yellow, arranged in racemes, and bloom in late spring or early summer. The subspecies diffusa is distinguished by its more rugged appearance compared to the typical form of Otiophora scabra."
