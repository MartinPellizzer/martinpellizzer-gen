    "intro": "Ophrys ferrum-equinum f. integerrima, commonly known as the iron horse orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait known as sexual deception. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by bees. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this orchid is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
