    "intro": "Odontochilus candidus, commonly known as the white-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, white flowers with a distinctive lip that is often adorned with a yellowish or greenish hue. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
