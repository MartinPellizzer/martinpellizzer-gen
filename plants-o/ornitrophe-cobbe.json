    "intro": "Ornitrophe cobbe, commonly known as the featherleaf orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It features slender, grass-like leaves that resemble bird feathers, giving it its unique common name. The plant produces small, pale violet flowers in clusters during the early spring. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
