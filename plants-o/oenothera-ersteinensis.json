It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often branching and erect. Oenothera ersteinensis is part of the Onagraceae family, which includes other evening primrose species known for their ecological and historical significance."
