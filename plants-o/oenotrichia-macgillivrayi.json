    "intro": "Oenotrichia macgillivrayi, commonly known as the MacGillivray's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its leafless stems and gelatinous, sticky berries that adhere to the branches of its host trees. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while it provides shelter and food for various insect species. Its unique ecological role makes it an important component of New Zealand's forest ecosystems. Oenotrichia macgillivrayi is also notable for its historical use by M\u0101ori people in traditional practices."
