    "intro": "Orobus canescens var. ensifolius, commonly known as the slender orobus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems covered in a grayish-white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The leaves are linear and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette at the base, and are covered in fine hairs. Its small, pale blue to purple flowers are clustered in loose panicles, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. This plant is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a common sight in dry, sunny habitats."
