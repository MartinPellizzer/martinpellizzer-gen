    "intro": "Orchis pyramidalis var. urvilleana, commonly known as the Urville's pyramidal orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and eastern Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear showy, violet to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. Its flowers are arranged in a dense spike, and it produces small, dark brown capsules as fruits. This variety is distinguished by its slightly different floral morphology compared to the typical form of Orchis pyramidalis."
