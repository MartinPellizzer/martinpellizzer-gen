    "intro": "Opuntia cochabambensis, commonly known as the Cochabamba prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Bolivia. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems called cladodes. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia cochabambensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with spines that help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Its structure and growth habits make it well-suited for survival in harsh, dry climates."
