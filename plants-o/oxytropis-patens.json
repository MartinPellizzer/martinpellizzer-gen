    "intro": "Oxytropis patens, commonly known as the creeping yellow vetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats, with slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, with small, hairy leaflets, and it is adapted to thrive in poor, sandy soils. Oxytropis patens plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
