    "intro": "Olbia hispida, commonly known as the roughleaf lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its dark green to blackish thallus with a rough, granular surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Olbia hispida is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
