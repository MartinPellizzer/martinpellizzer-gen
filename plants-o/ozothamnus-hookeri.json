    "intro": "Ozothamnus hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's golden daisy, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in coastal and subalpine regions, characterized by its silver-gray foliage and bright yellow flowers. The plant features a compact growth habit with wiry stems and small, rounded leaves. Its flowers are clustered in dense heads, often surrounded by pale green bracts, and bloom in spring and early summer. Ozothamnus hookeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and hardiness."
