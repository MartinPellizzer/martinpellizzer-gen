    "intro": "Opuntia infesta, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are often used as leaves. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, called a tuna, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. Opuntia infesta is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
