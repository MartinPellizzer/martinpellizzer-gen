    "intro": "Oncidium cardiochilum, commonly known as the \"Heart-lobed Orchid,\" is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, racemose inflorescence that produces numerous fragrant, butterfly-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad, fleshy, and often have a waxy texture to retain moisture. Oncidium cardiochilum is valued in horticulture for its vibrant colors and long-lasting blooms."
