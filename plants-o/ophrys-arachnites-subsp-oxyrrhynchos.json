    "intro": "Ophrys arachnites subsp. oxyrrhynchos, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive floral structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a complex labellum that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open grasslands and woodland edges. The subspecies oxyrrhynchos is distinguished by its more elongated and narrow flower shape compared to other Ophrys species."
