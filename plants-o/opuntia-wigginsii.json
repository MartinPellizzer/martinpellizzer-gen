    "intro": "Opuntia wigginsii, commonly known as the Wiggins prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia wigginsii is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in desert ecosystems."
