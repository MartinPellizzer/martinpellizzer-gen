    "intro": "Ophrys aveyronensis subsp. vitorica, commonly known as the Vitorica bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern France. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils within Mediterranean shrublands, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. Its flowering period occurs between April and June, producing showy, bee-like flowers that are adapted for specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
