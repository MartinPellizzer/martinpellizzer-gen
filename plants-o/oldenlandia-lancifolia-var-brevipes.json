    "intro": "Oldenlandia lancifolia var. brevipes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mile-a-minute vine, is a fast-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, trailing stems with opposite, lanceolate leaves that are typically hairy and have a distinctive reddish or purple hue. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in umbels, which are often followed by bead-like, blue or purple berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
