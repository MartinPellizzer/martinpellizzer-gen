    "intro": "Olax loranthiformis, commonly known as the parasitic olax, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Olacaceae and is characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants while performing photosynthesis. The plant typically has small, opposite leaves and produces yellow or greenish-yellow flowers. It is often found growing on trees and shrubs in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical significance lies in its ecological role as both a parasite and a potential host for other organisms."
