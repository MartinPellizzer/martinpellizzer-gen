    "intro": "Osmia odorata, commonly known as the fragrant mason bee, is a solitary bee species native to various regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, metallic-blue body and is often seen pollinating a wide range of flowering plants. The female constructs its nest in hollow stems or pre-existing cavities, where it lays eggs and provisions them with pollen. Osmia odorata plays a vital role in pollination, contributing to the reproduction of both wild and cultivated plants. Its preference for early-flowering plants makes it an important pollinator in spring ecosystems."
