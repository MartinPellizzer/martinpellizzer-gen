It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from white to pale yellow. The plant produces clusters of fragrant blooms during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage consists of strap-like leaves that are dark green and slightly glossy. Olyra kegelii is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower due to its elegant appearance."
