    "intro": "Oligodorella, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rockrose, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. Native to rocky and arid regions of southern Europe and northern Africa, it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant is often found growing on cliffs, slopes, and other dry, sunny habitats. Its low-growing habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy ornamental plant suitable for rock gardens."
