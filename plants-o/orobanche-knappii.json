    "intro": "Orobanche knappii, commonly known as the Knapp's broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to parts of southern Europe and the Mediterranean region. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, tubular structure that facilitates pollination by insects. It is often found growing on the roots of various herbaceous plants, particularly those in the legume family. Due to its specialized parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecological niche."
