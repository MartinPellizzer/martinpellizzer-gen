    "intro": "Oxytropis hailarensis f. hailarensis, commonly known as the Hailar oxytropis, is a perennial legume native to the grasslands of northern China. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of purple or pink. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates with moderate rainfall. This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in nitrogen fixation and its potential for use in restoration projects."
