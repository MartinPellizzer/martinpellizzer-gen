    "intro": "Olea aquifolium var. cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holm oak, is a variant of the holm oak native to the Mediterranean region. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy and have a distinctively narrow form. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by small, leathery fruits that are typically inedible for humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide shade in urban and rural landscapes."
