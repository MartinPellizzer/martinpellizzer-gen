    "intro": "Ornduffia parnassiifolia, commonly known as the Parnassian bellflower, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the high elevations of the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, which bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to the cold, harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. It thrives in rocky soil and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
