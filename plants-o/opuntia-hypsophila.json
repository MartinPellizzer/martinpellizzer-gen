    "intro": "Opuntia hypsophila, commonly known as the highland prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its flat, spineless stems that are often covered in a whitish coating, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by bright red or yellow fruits. Opuntia hypsophila is adapted to high-altitude environments and requires well-drained soil and full sun exposure. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit."
