    "intro": "Orchis coriophora f. alba, commonly known as the white marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to parts of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers. This subspecies is distinguished by its predominantly white floral coloration, which sets it apart from the typical greenish-yellow flowers of the main species. It thrives in wet, calcareous habitats such as marshes and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
