    "intro": "Oncidium lucescens, commonly known as the Golden Cattleya, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescence that bears numerous fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with a distinctive white lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its unique appearance. Oncidium lucescens is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate with proper care."
