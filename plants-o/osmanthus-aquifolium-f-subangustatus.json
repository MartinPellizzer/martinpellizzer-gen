    "intro": "Osmanthus aquifolium f. subangustatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved osmanthus, is a rare and distinctive cultivar of the osmanthus genus. It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves that are typically a deep green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late autumn, emitting a sweet, honey-like scent. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique foliage and aromatic properties. This form is less common in the wild and is primarily found in specific regions of China where it thrives in temperate climates."
