    "intro": "Ochthocosmus grandifolius, commonly known as the large-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees. It has woody stems and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant's leaves are broad and leathery, with a distinctive glossy appearance. It relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while conducting photosynthesis to produce its own food. Ochthocosmus grandifolius is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in ecosystem dynamics."
