    "intro": "Oxytropis caudata, commonly known as the long-horned milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its hairy, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Oxytropis caudata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
