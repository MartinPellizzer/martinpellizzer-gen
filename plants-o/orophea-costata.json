    "intro": "Orophea costata, commonly known as the Costate Orophea, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Randiaceae. It is native to the island of Madagascar and is characterized by its striking, palm-like appearance with elongated, segmented leaves. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a distinctive waxy coating. Orophea costata is typically found in moist, shaded forest environments, where it thrives in the understory. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
