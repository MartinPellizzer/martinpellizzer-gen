    "intro": "Oreobolus furcatus var. gaimardioides, commonly known as the Gaimard's spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in desert or coastal dune environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its slightly different leaf morphology and flowering structure."
