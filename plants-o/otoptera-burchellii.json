    "intro": "Otoptera burchellii, commonly known as the Burchell's shield fern, is a tropical fern native to regions of Africa and Madagascar. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in humid conditions. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a unique pattern of veins that aid in water retention."
