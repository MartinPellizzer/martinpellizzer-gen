    "intro": "Orinus alticulmus, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant blooms that typically appear in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from poor soil, and it has a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Orinus alticulmus is considered a vulnerable species."
