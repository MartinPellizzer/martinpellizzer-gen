    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 haussknechtii, commonly known as the Haussknecht's orchid, is a hybrid orchid species that results from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis anthropophora. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland habitats across Europe. Its flowers have a distinctive lip that is often marked with dark purple or brown patterns. This orchid is considered a rare and protected species due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity."
