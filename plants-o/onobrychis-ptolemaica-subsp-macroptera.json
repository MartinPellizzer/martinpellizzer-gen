    "intro": "Onobrychis ptolemaica subsp. macroptera, commonly known as the Egyptian clover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a robust root system that helps it thrive in poor soils and arid conditions. It is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, contributing to soil stabilization. Its seeds are adapted for dispersal by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively."
