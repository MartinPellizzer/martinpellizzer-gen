    "intro": "Orchis morio f. velutina, commonly known as the velvet twayblade, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves and its unique, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in association with specific host plants. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in many regions."
