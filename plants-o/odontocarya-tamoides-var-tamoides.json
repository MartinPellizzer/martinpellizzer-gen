    "intro": "Odontocarya tamoides var. tamoides, commonly known as the yellow-flowered sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and fleshy, succulent stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
