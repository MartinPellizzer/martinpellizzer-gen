    "intro": "Onobrychis linearis, commonly known as narrowleaf burclover, is a leguminous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces pods containing small, hard seeds that are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Onobrychis linearis is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
