    "intro": "Osmelia borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean osmella, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with elliptical leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with five petals and a prominent central tube, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not widely consumed. Due to habitat loss, Osmelia borneensis is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
