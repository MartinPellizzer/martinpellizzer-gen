    "intro": "Oberonia calcicola, commonly known as the limestone orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the limestone hills of southern China and northern Vietnam. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and requires specific microhabitats for successful growth. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical studies. Due to habitat destruction, Oberonia calcicola is considered endangered and is protected in some regions."
