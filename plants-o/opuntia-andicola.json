    "intro": "Opuntia andicola, commonly known as the Andean prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the highlands of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems, which are covered in sharp spines and glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and has a sweet, juicy flavor. Opuntia andicola is adapted to arid and high-altitude environments, making it a resilient and drought-tolerant plant."
