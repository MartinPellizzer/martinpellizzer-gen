    "intro": "Opuntia tardospina, commonly known as the slow-spine prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are small, hair-like structures. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Opuntia tardospina is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, succulent stems. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in some regions."
