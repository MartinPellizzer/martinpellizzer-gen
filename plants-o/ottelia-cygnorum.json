    "intro": "Ottelia cygnorum, commonly known as the water buttercup, is a aquatic plant native to wetland environments in Africa and Asia. It features floating leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom above the water surface, attracting pollinators such as bees and insects. Its root system helps stabilize soil in shallow waters, preventing erosion. Ottelia cygnorum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to improve water quality."
