    "intro": "Oxytropis curviflora, commonly known as the curlleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, often curling leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Oxytropis curviflora plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
