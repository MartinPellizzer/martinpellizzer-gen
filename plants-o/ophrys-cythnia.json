    "intro": "Ophrys cythnia, commonly known as the Cythnian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a form of mimicry used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a hairy, bee-like labellum that plays a crucial role in its reproductive strategy. Ophrys cythnia thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range."
