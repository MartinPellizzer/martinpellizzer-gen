    "intro": "Ophiopogon longifolius, commonly known as the Japanese spathiphyllum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features dense, grass-like foliage with long, narrow leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form compact, evergreen clumps over time."
