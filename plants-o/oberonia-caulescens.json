It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the forest floor, and it forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Oberonia caulescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
