    "intro": "Onoclea sensibilis f. obtusilobata, commonly known as the broad-lobed water fern, is a variant of the sensitive water fern. It is a fern species characterized by its large, delicate fronds that are typically divided into broad, rounded lobes. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and stream banks. Its fronds are often submerged or floating, contributing to aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms. The plant's reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family."
