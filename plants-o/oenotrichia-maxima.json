    "intro": "Oenotrichia maxima, commonly known as the giant sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Oenotrichia maxima thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in swampy or marshy environments. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for native invertebrates."
