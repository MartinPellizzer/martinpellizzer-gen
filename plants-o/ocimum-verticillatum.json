    "intro": "Ocimum verticillatum, commonly known as creeping basil, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, fragrant leaves that emit a strong basil scent. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb, valued for their aromatic properties. Ocimum verticillatum thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as a ground cover or in ornamental gardens."
