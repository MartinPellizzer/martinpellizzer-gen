    "intro": "Oxalis cernua var. maculata, commonly known as the spotted wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with distinctive red or purple markings and produces small, five-petaled yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread easily. It is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it contributes to the understory vegetation. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shady garden settings."
