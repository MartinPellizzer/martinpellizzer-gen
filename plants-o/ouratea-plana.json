It is characterized by its simple, opposite, and usually elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy on top. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the dry season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. The plant is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
