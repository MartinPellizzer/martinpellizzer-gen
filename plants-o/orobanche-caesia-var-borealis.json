    "intro": "Orobanche caesia var. borealis, commonly known as the northern common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, often growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific host species, and it plays a role in certain ecological interactions. Due to its parasitic nature, it is not typically cultivated but is of interest in botanical studies."
