    "intro": "Ornithocephalus lankesteri, commonly known as the Lankester's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, intricate floral structure. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and often display a striking combination of colors, including white, yellow, and green. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
