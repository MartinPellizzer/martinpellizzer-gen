    "intro": "Ononis repens var. miniana, commonly known as creeping restharrow, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, sprawling stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its leaves are linear and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. It is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as cliffs, roadsides, and disturbed areas."
