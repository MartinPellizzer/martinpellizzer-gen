    "intro": "Olea europaea var. araban, commonly known as the Arabian olive, is a variant of the common olive tree native to the Arabian Peninsula. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree, typically reaching heights of 3 to 6 meters. The plant features dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a distinctive aromatic scent. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are followed by edible, wrinkled drupes that are often used in local cuisine. The Arabian olive is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and resilient species in its native habitat."
