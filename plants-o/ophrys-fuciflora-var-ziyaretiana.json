    "intro": "Ophrys fuciflora var. ziyaretiana, commonly known as the Turkish bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Turkey. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils in mountainous regions, thriving in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers are usually a mix of brown, yellow, and green hues, resembling the body and wings of a bee. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
