    "intro": "Opuntia hamiltonii, commonly known as the Hamilton's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and are often segmented. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia hamiltonii is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system. It plays an important role in its ecosystem, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
