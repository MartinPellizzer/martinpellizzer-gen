    "intro": "Orobanche mutelii var. mutelii, commonly known as the yellow broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in regions such as Europe and parts of Asia. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for many years, making it a persistent weed in agricultural settings. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of crops."
