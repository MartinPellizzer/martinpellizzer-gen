    "intro": "Opuntia missouriensis var. salmonea, commonly known as the Missouri prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the central United States. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, a segmented pear-shaped structure, is edible and often used in local cuisines. This variety is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in its native range."
