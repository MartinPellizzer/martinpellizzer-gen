    "intro": "Oreomyrrhis andicola var. rigida, commonly known as the rigid oreomyrrhis, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific high-altitude regions. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or andic soils, thriving in cool and moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a bluish-green hue, while its flowers are small and clustered. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
