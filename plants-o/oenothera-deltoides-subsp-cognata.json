    "intro": "Oenothera deltoides subsp. cognata, commonly known as the plains evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the central and western United States. It is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats like prairies and disturbed soils, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. This species is also valued for its oil-rich seeds, which have been used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential fatty acids."
