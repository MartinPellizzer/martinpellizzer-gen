    "intro": "Oxytropis pilosa var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically reaches heights of only a few inches, making it well adapted to rocky and disturbed soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to harsh environmental conditions."
