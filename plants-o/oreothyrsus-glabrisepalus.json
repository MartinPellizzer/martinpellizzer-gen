    "intro": "Oreothyrsus glabrisepalus, commonly known as the smooth-sepaled orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip, which is smooth and lacks the typical hairy texture seen in many orchids. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in undergrowth near streams or in dense vegetation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
