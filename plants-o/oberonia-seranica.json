    "intro": "Oberonia seranica, commonly known as the Seranica orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a short rhizome with a few leaves and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its flowers are characterized by their intricate structure and are often pollinated by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oberonia seranica is considered a rare and endangered species."
