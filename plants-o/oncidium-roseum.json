    "intro": "Oncidium roseum, commonly known as the pink orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features elongated, pendulous flower spikes that bloom in shades of pink, white, and yellow, creating a striking visual display. The plant has strap-like leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, providing a lush backdrop for its vibrant flowers. Oncidium roseum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its relatively easy care requirements and long-lasting blooms."
