    "intro": "Oxytropis lambertii f. pannosa, commonly known as the pannose milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This variety is part of the Oxytropis genus, which is known for its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules."
