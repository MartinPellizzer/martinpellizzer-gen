    "intro": "Orobanche pancicii f. gymnandra, commonly known as the gymnandra broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish to reddish stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. This species typically parasitizes members of the legume family, such as Vicia and Astragalus, by inserting its haustoria into the host's vascular system. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth and development of its host, making it an important ecological component in certain ecosystems. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants."
