    "intro": "Octotheca ouveana, commonly known as the Ouvean starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its star-shaped, brightly colored petals that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with dark green, glossy leaves that are oval in shape. Its flowers typically appear in late spring to early summer, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils under partial to full sun. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
