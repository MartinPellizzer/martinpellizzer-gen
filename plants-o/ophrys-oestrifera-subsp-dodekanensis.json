    "intro": "Ophrys oestrifera subsp. dodekanensis, commonly known as the Dodecanese bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found primarily in the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
