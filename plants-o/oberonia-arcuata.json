    "intro": "Oberonia arcuata, commonly known as the curved orchid, is a species of flowering plant in the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia. This epiphytic plant typically grows on trees, using its roots to anchor itself without drawing nutrients from its host. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a mix of white, green, and yellow hues. Oberonia arcuata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
