    "intro": "Oxytropis xerophila, commonly known as the desert locoweed, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and reduced leaf surface area. It is often found in sagebrush steppe and other xeric habitats. Oxytropis xerophila plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife, though it can be toxic to livestock in high concentrations."
