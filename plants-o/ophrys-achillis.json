    "intro": "Ophrys achillis, commonly known as the Achilles' heel orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female wasps to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually pale green or brown, with intricate patterns that aid in mimicry. Ophrys achillis is a protected species in many areas due to habitat loss and over-collection."
