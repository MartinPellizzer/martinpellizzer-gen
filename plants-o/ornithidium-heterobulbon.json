    "intro": "Ornithidium heterobulbon, commonly known as the bulbous orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique bulb-like structures that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming during the wet season. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often growing close to the ground. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many countries."
