    "intro": "[WRONG START] Ornu cuspidata, commonly known as the Japanese hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in catkins, which are followed by small, round fruits. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with distinct ridges that become more pronounced with age. Ornus cuspidata is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive form and seasonal color changes."
