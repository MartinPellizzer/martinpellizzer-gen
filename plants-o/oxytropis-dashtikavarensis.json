    "intro": "Oxytropis dashtikavarensis, commonly known as the Dashtikavaran locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often growing in rocky soils and saline areas. Its leaves are typically small and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration. Oxytropis dashtikavarensis is also noted for its toxic properties, containing alkaloids that can be harmful to grazing animals."
