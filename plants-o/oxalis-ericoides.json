It features small, heart-shaped leaves with distinctive red veins and produces delicate, five-petaled white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often found in rocky or coastal areas, where it forms dense mats. Oxalis ericoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
