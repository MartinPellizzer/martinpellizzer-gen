    "intro": "Ocellochloa brachystachya, commonly known as the short-stalked hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact inflorescences that consist of short, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing branches. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along streambanks. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil in its habitat. Ocellochloa brachystachya is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity and its use in ornamental and ecological restoration projects."
