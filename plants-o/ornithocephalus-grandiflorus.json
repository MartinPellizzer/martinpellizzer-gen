    "intro": "Ornithocephalus grandiflorus, commonly known as the grandiflorous orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The orchid's flowers are often pink or purple, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species."
