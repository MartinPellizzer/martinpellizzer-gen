    "intro": "Oxydectes pavana, commonly known as the swamp mallow, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems. Oxydectes pavana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
