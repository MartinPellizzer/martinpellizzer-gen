    "intro": "Orchis omeishanica, commonly known as the Omeishan Orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions in China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing intricate floral structures with specialized pollination mechanisms. Its habitat is often limited to moist, shaded forest floors, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat sensitivity, Orchis omeishanica is considered a species of conservation concern."
