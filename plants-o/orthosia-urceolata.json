    "intro": "Orthosia urceolata, commonly known as the bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like seed pods that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush habitats. It produces yellow flowers in early spring, and its leaves are alternate, pinnately divided, and covered in fine hairs. Orthosia urceolata is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress plants."
