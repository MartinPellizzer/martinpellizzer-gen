It features delicate, trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped lobes and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has upright, somewhat woody stems that are covered in fine, hairy pubescence. Its leaves and flowers are often used in ornamental gardening due to their attractive appearance. Oxalis rigidicaulis thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
