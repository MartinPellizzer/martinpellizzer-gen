    "intro": "Oxycoccus palustris subsp. microcarpus, commonly known as the small-fruited bog cranberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, red berries that are typically less than 5 mm in diameter, which are adapted for dispersal by birds. The plant thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor wetlands and bogs, where its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the soil. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, with a waxy coating that reduces water loss in its moist, often waterlogged habitat. The species is closely related to other cranberry species but is distinguished by its smaller fruits and specific ecological preferences."
