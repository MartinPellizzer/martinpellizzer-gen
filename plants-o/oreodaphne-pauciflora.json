    "intro": "Oreodaphne pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered daphne, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
