    "intro": "Otholobium sericeum, commonly known as silky otholobium, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It features slender, wiry stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale yellow or white, arranged in dense, terminal clusters. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often pubescent, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Otholobium sericeum is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions."
