It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their simple, opposite leaves and showy, yellow or orange flowers. Ochnella species often have a rough, fissured bark and produce small, woody fruits. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
