    "intro": "Oxytropis mandshurica f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in racemes, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
