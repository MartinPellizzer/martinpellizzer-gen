    "intro": "Oxygonum lineare, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marshmallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features slender, linear leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters during the summer months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, often water-saturated soils. Oxygonum lineare is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes."
