It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its hairy, oval-shaped leaves and small, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. It is known for its ability to spread via runners, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. The species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
