    "intro": "Oxytropis glareosa, commonly known as the glaucous locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that are usually pale blue to yellow in color. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a distinctive bluish-gray coating that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Oxytropis glareosa is part of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and it has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules."
