    "intro": "Onobrychis depauperata, commonly known as the poor man's clover, is a low-growing perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features small, trifoliate leaves and produces yellowish or reddish pea-like flowers, which bloom in early summer. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and wastelands. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment in agricultural settings."
