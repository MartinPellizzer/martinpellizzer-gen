    "intro": "Opuntia leptocaulis f. brevispina, commonly known as the short-spined prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features flattened, fleshy stems that are typically green with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its short, spiny stems are adapted to arid environments, allowing it to store water efficiently. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
