    "intro": "Oncodia, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to South America, particularly Brazil. The plants typically have basal leaves that are alternate and often covered in fine hairs. They produce small, yellow flowers that are clustered in composite heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. Oncodia species are often found in moist, shaded areas and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
