    "intro": "Onobrychis darwasica, commonly known as the Darwasica burr clover, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces cylindrical, spiny pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in semi-arid regions."
