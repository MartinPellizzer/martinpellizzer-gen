It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescences that bear clusters of bright yellow flowers. The plant has strap-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Oncidium johannis is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its vibrant color and relatively easy care requirements."
