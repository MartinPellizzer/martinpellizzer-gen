    "intro": "Orobanche salvifixa, commonly known as the common yellow broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants, making it a weed of concern in certain ecosystems."
