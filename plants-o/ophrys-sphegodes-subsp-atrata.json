    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes subsp. atrata, commonly known as the black bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and grasslands. Its flowers are dark purple to black in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
