    "intro": "Opuntia subsphaerocarpa, commonly known as the globe cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical or globose stems, which are covered in dense clusters of spines and are often ribbed. The plant produces vibrant yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tunafly, is edible and contains small, sweet seeds. Opuntia subsphaerocarpa is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
