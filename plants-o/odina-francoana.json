It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white flowers. The plant derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized roots called haustoria. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly in countries like Brazil and Peru. Odina francoana plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain birds and insects."
