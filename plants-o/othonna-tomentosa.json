    "intro": "Othonna tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly othonna, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly grayish-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
