    "intro": "Ornithogalum kochii subsp. monticola, commonly known as the mountain ornithogalum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, rhizomatous stem with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive."
