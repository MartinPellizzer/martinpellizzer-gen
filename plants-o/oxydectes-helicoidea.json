    "intro": "Oxydectes helicoidea, commonly known as the spiral waterwheel plant, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves that spiral around its stem. It is native to freshwater habitats in tropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia. The plant's leaves are thin and ribbon-like, often floating on the water surface while the lower portion remains submerged. It is adapted to slow-moving or still waters and can form dense mats that provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. Its distinctive morphology and ecological role make it an important species in aquatic ecosystems."
