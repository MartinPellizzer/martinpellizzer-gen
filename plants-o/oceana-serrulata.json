    "intro": "Oceana serrulata, commonly known as the serrated seaflower, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue and purple flowers that bloom along the shoreline during the summer months. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky coastal habitats, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and serrated, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Oceana serrulata plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small coastal organisms."
