    "intro": "Oxytropis glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth locoweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature. However, it can be toxic to livestock if consumed in large quantities."
