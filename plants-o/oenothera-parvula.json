    "intro": "Oenothera parvula, commonly known as the small evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that open in the evening, hence its common name. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Oenothera parvula is known for its ability to thrive in arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
