    "intro": "Orchis anatolica subsp. sezikiana, commonly known as the Anatolian orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to regions of Turkey and the Balkans. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing intricate, lip-shaped petals that are adapted for pollination by insects. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this subspecies is considered endangered in some areas."
