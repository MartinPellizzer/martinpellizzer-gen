    "intro": "Olea ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty olive, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Europe and northern Africa. It belongs to the Oleaceae family, which includes other olive species. The plant is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit is a small, leathery drupe that turns dark when mature. Olea ferruginea is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its dense foliage and tolerance to poor soil conditions."
