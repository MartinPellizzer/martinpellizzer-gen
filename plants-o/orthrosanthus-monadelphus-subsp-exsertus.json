    "intro": "Orthrosanthus monadelphus subsp. exsertus, commonly known as the slender rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces a single, erect spadix with numerous tiny, sessile flowers, a feature common in many orchid species. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to grow in full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
