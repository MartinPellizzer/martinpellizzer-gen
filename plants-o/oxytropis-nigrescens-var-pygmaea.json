It typically thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sagebrush steppe and rocky soils. The plant features small, hairy leaves and produces yellow to reddish-purple pea-like flowers. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. This variety is part of the Fabaceae family, which includes many nitrogen-fixing plants."
