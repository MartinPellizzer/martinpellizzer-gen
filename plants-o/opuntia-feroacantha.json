    "intro": "Opuntia feroacantha, commonly known as the broadleaf prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and are often segmented. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are modified into flat, paddle-shaped structures that help reduce water loss. Opuntia feroacantha is adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food."
