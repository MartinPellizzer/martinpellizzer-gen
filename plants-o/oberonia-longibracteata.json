    "intro": "Oberonia longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces striking, pendulous inflorescences with small, showy flowers that are typically greenish-white with red or purple markings. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique growth habit."
