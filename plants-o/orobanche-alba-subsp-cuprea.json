    "intro": "Orobanche alba subsp. cuprea, commonly known as the red broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color, and it is often found in disturbed soils or agricultural fields. The plant has a short, fleshy stem with no true leaves, and its root system consists of haustoria that penetrate the roots of its host. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is considered a weed in some agricultural contexts. The species is characterized by its distinctive reddish coloration and its unique parasitic lifestyle."
