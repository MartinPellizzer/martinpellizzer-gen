    "intro": "Orthopichonia barteri, commonly known as the Barter's orthopichonia, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its small, white flowers are often overlooked due to its inconspicuous appearance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
