It features heart-shaped leaves with distinctive reddish veins and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and woodland settings. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and prolonged flowering period."
