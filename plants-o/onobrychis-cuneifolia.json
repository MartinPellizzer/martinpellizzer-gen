    "intro": "Onobrychis cuneifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf burclover, is a perennial legume native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are narrow and pointed, and its small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, and it is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
