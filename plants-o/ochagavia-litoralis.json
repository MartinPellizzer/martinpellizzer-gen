    "intro": "Ochagavia litoralis, commonly known as the coastal cholla, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often branched and covered in small, spine-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils and can tolerate salt spray from the sea. Ochagavia litoralis is a hardy, drought-resistant species that plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
