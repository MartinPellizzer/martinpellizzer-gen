    "intro": "Odontella deflersii, commonly known as the golden algae, is a unicellular marine alga belonging to the class Bacillariophyceae. It is characterized by its golden-brown color due to the presence of fucoxanthin, a type of carotenoid pigment. The organism forms intricate silica cell walls, known as frustules, which are ornamented with complex patterns. It thrives in coastal waters and is often found in estuaries and brackish environments. Odontella deflersii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to primary productivity and serving as a food source for various microorganisms."
