    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia var. curvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid with curved leaves, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and delicate, pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are spurred at the base, a distinctive feature of many orchid species. The variety curvifolia is distinguished by its uniquely curved leaf shape, which sets it apart from other variants of Orchis angustifolia."
