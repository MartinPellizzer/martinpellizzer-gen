It features intricate, often fragrant flowers with a distinctive, elongated lip that is adorned with fine, ciliate (fringed) hairs. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on its aerial roots for moisture and nutrients. Its leaves are usually broad and strap-like, and it produces clusters of flowers in a range of colors including yellow, orange, and red. Oncidium ciliatulum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
