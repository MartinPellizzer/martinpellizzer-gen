    "intro": "Oxybaphus polytrichus, commonly known as the African hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in wetland and marshy environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Its root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in its natural habitat. Oxybaphus polytrichus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and environmental benefits."
