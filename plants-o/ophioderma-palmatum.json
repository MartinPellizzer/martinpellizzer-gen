    "intro": "Ophioderma palmatum, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a unique epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmate fronds that resemble a star, with bright yellow to gold-colored veins contrasting against its dark green foliage. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the understory of tropical forests. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients in its natural habitat. The golden star fern is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
