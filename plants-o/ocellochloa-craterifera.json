    "intro": "Ocellochloa craterifera, commonly known as the mountain clover, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, serrated leaf blades and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing tiny white or pale yellow flowers. Ocellochloa craterifera plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine environments and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme conditions."
