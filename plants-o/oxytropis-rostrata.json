    "intro": "Oxytropis rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, characterized by its slender stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Oxytropis rostrata is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
