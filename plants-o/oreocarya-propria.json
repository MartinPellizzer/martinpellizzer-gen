    "intro": "Oreocarya propria, commonly known as the Sierra primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Oreocarya propria is an important species for pollinators and is often found in alpine meadows."
