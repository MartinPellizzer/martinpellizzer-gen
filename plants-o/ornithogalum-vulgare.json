    "intro": "Ornithogalum vulgare, commonly known as the star of Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is characterized by its bulbous underground stem, which stores nutrients and allows it to survive in various soil types. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or open meadows. Ornithogalum vulgare is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
