    "intro": "Oenanthe ambigua, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water dropwort, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as along the edges of ponds and streams. Its roots contain compounds that have been traditionally used in herbal medicine, though it is considered toxic in large quantities. Oenanthe ambigua plays a role in supporting local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small aquatic organisms."
