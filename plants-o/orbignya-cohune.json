    "intro": "Orbignya cohune, commonly known as the coconut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The tree produces a distinctive fruit known as the coconut, which contains a white, fleshy mesocarp and a hard, inner shell. The coconut is rich in oil and has been used for food, medicine, and industrial purposes for centuries. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptability to coastal and tropical climates."
