    "intro": "Oreophilus villosus, commonly known as the hairy mountain orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its arid, mountainous habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale purple, typically blooming in late spring. Oreophilus villosus thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
