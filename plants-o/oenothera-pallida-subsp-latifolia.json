    "intro": "Oenothera pallida subsp. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf evening primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features showy yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are broader than those of the typical Oenothera pallida, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats like grasslands and disturbed areas. Its botanical significance lies in its role in ecological systems and its potential for ornamental and medicinal use."
