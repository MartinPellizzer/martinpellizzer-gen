    "intro": "Opuntia toumeyi, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible fruit known as tunas. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to poor soil conditions. Opuntia toumeyi is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine and as a food source."
