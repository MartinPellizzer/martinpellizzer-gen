    "intro": "Oocarpon jussiaeoides, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features showy, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy and have a waxy coating. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds with silky appendages for wind dispersal. Oocarpon jussiaeoides plays a vital role in supporting pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees, in its native environment."
