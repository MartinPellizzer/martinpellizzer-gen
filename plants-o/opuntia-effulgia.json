    "intro": "Opuntia effulgia, commonly known as the golden prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its large, flattened, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and are often ribbed. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which are typically followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia effulgia is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick stems. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine."
