    "intro": "Onobrychis tenuis, commonly known as slender burr medic, is a low-growing perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters along the stems. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces distinctive, curved burrs that contain seeds. It thrives in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration and as a forage plant."
