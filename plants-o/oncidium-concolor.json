    "intro": "Oncidium concolor, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, yellow flowers. The plant has strap-like leaves that are usually dark green and covered in a fine, waxy coating. Oncidium concolor thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
