It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The variety 'lucidum' is distinguished by its shiny, smooth foliage, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
