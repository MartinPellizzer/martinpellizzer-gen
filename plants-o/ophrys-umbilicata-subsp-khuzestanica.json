    "intro": "Ophrys umbilicata subsp. khuzestanica, commonly known as the Khuzestan bee orchid, is a rare orchid species native to western Iran. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements."
