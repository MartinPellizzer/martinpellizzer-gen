    "intro": "Orthopenthea fasciata, commonly known as the banded orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a distinctive yellow or green stripe down the center of each petal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
