    "intro": "Oncidium variegatum subsp. velutinum, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, yellow-green flowers with red markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. It produces showy, orchid-like blooms that can last several weeks, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its botanical features make it well-suited for indoor cultivation with proper light and humidity conditions."
