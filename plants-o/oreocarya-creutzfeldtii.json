    "intro": "Oreocarya creutzfeldtii, commonly known as the Creutzfeldt's oreocarya, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it adapts to harsh climatic conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
