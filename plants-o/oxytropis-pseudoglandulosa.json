    "intro": "Oxytropis pseudoglandulosa, commonly known as the broad-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, compound leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, temperate climates. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Oxytropis pseudoglandulosa is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits surrounding vegetation."
