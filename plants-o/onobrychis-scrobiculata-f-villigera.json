    "intro": "Onobrychis scrobiculata f. villigera, commonly known as the yellow vetch, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive yellowish-green color and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or arid environments. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to tolerate drought conditions. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to prevent soil erosion."
