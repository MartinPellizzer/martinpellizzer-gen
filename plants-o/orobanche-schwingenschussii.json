    "intro": "Orobanche schwingenschussii, commonly known as the Schwingenschuss broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and is entirely dependent on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing species within the Fabaceae family. The plant produces small, often yellow or brown flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to regions of Europe and is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it plays a unique role in its ecological niche."
