    "intro": "Ornithogalum costatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, rhizomatous stem and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Ornithogalum costatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
