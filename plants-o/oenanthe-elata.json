    "intro": "Oenanthe elata, commonly known as the tall water dropwort, is a perennial herb native to wetland and riparian habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish or purplish tinge. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in umbels, typically blooming from June to August. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Oenanthe elata is adapted to moist environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil along waterways."
