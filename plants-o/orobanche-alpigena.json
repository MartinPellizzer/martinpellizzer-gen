    "intro": "Orobanche alpigena, commonly known as the alpine broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is found in alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a spike, and its life cycle is closely tied to specific host species such as those in the Brassicaceae family. Due to its specialized nature, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a food source for certain insects and its unique parasitic adaptation."
