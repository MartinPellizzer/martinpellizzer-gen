    "intro": "Ouret scandens, commonly known as the climbing pomegranate, is a woody vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its long, flexible stems that allow it to climb and twine around supports. The plant produces striking, red-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, round fruits similar to pomegranates. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly serrated margin. Ouret scandens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
