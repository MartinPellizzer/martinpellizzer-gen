    "intro": "Ophrys fusca subsp. proxima, commonly known as the Lesser Bee Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in acidic, nutrient-poor soils in open woodland or heathland habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. The species is considered endangered due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
