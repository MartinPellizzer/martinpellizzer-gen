    "intro": "Odontoglossum \u00d7 wilckeanum var. pallens, commonly known as the White Orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that are often adorned with subtle green or purple markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs are elongated and cylindrical, supporting the plant's growth and storage of nutrients. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, making it a prized ornamental plant in horticulture."
