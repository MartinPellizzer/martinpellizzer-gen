    "intro": "Onosma verruculosa, commonly known as the woolly onosma, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
