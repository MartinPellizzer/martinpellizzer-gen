    "intro": "Olea europaea var. rotundata, commonly known as the round-leaved olive, is a variety of the olive tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its rounded, thick leaves that are typically larger than those of the standard olive tree. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by edible fruits, which are rich in oil and have been used for centuries in culinary and medicinal applications. Its growth habit is compact and shrub-like, making it suitable for ornamental gardening. The variety is also valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in dry, sunny conditions."
