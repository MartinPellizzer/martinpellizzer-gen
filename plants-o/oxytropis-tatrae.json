    "intro": "Oxytropis tatrae, commonly known as the Tatra oxytropis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe, particularly the Carpathian Mountains. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes, where it is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets, and it produces pods that contain lens-shaped seeds. Oxytropis tatrae is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in alpine ecosystems."
