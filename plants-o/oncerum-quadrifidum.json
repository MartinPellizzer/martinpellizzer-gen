    "intro": "Oncerum quadrifidum, commonly known as the four-lobed orchid, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, yellow, and green. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in seasonal environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, while its roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in moist, well-drained soil. Oncerum quadrifidum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right growing conditions."
