    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza pilosissima, commonly known as the silky ophiorrhiza, is a tropical shrub belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, opposite leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers, followed by small, round berries that are typically yellow or red when mature. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories in Southeast Asia. Ophiorrhiza pilosissima is noted for its adaptability to wet conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
