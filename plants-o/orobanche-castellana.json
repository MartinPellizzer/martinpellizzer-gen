    "intro": "Orobanche castellana, commonly known as the Castilian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found primarily in Mediterranean regions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive appearance with a short stem and clustered leaves. It parasitizes various species of legumes, including Vicia and Astragalus. Due to its lack of roots and photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem as a specialized parasite."
