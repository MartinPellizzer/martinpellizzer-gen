    "intro": "Oxydectes ardisioides, commonly known as the red-flowered oxalis, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It features striking, heart-shaped leaves with a reddish tint and produces clusters of delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of red and pink. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and showy blooms that appear in spring. Oxydectes ardisioides is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
