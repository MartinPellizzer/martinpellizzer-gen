    "intro": "Oxysepala lewisensis, commonly known as the Lewis's oxysepala, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing white to pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Oxysepala lewisensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
