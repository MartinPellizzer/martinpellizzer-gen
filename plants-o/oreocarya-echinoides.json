    "intro": "Oreocarya echinoides, commonly known as the spiny oreocarya, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and leaves, which help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered a resilient species in its native range."
