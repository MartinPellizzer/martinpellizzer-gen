    "intro": "Ouratea polyantha, commonly known as the clustered ouratea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories. The plant is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pale green flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that contains several seeds, contributing to its role in forest regeneration."
