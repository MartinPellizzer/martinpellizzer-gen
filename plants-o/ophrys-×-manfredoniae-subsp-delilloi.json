The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with a distinctively shaped labellum that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. This subspecies is valued for its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native environment."
