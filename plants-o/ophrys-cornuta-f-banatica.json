    "intro": "Ophrys cornuta f. banatica, commonly known as the Banat horned orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkans. It is characterized by its unique, bee-like flower structure, which features a prominent, horn-shaped spur and intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of female bees. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. Its flowers bloom in early spring, producing a delicate, pale yellow to greenish hue. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
