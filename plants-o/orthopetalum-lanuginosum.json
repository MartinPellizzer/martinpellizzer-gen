    "intro": "Orthopetalum lanuginosum, commonly known as the wooly orthopetalum, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, or lanuginous, stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its fruit is a small, berry-like drupe that ripens to a dark red color in the fall. Orthopetalum lanuginosum is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
