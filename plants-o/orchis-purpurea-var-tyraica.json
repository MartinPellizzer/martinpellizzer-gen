    "intro": "Orchis purpurea var. tyraica, commonly known as the Tyrian orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy purple or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in woodland habitats and thrives in shaded, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its flowers have a distinct three-lipped structure, with the lower lip being the most prominent and often adorned with intricate markings. The Tyrian orchid is also notable for its ability to form mycorrhizal associations with fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake."
