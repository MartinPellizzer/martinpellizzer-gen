    "intro": "Oenothera thalassaphila, commonly known as the sea sand evening primrose, is a species of flowering plant native to coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that open in the evening, and its ability to thrive in sandy, coastal soils. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, oval seeds. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Oenothera thalassaphila plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing nectar for nocturnal pollinators."
