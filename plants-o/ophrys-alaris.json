    "intro": "Ophrys alaris, commonly known as the Early Marsh Orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and damp woodlands, thriving in moist, calcareous soils. The plant has a slender, upright stem that can reach up to 60 cm in height, bearing a single, showy flower with a distinctive lip that mimics the appearance of a female wasp. Its flowers bloom from late winter to early spring, often before the leaves emerge, and are pollinated by male wasps that are deceived into attempting to mate with the flower. The species is also notable for its role in supporting local biodiversity and its ecological importance in wetland habitats."
