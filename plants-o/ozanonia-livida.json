    "intro": "Ozanonia livida, commonly known as the green mossy orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in pine woodlands and along stream banks. Its unique botanical features include a sympodial growth habit and a specialized root system adapted for nutrient absorption in acidic soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ozanonia livida is considered a conservation concern."
