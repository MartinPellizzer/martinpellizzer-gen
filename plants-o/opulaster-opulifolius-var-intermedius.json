It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often reddish-brown beneath. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by capsule fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
