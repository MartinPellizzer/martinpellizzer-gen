    "intro": "Opuntia picardoi, commonly known as the Picard's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and are often ribbed. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia picardoi is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water. Its structure and growth habits make it a notable example of xerophytic adaptation in the plant kingdom."
