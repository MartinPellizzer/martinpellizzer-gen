    "intro": "Opuntia americana, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, typically in the spring and summer. Its fruit, the prickly pear, is edible and contains a juicy, sweet pulp. Opuntia americana is well adapted to arid environments and plays an important role in desert ecosystems."
