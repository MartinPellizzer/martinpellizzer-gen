    "intro": "Opuntia candelabriformis, commonly known as the candlestick prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to 10 feet in height, forming a tree-like structure. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are modified into spiny stems, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid environments. Opuntia candelabriformis is well adapted to hot, dry climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
