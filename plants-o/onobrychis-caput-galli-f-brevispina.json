    "intro": "Onobrychis caput-galli f. brevispina, commonly known as the short-spined goat's rue, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with short, stiff spines. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by flat, bean-like pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and ecological restorations."
