    "intro": "Oxydectes mauritiana, commonly known as the Mauritius starling orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the island of Mauritius. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate floral structure. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration pattern, typically featuring white and purple hues. It thrives in specific microhabitats, such as shaded rock crevices, and requires a humid, tropical climate. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
