    "intro": "Onosma carduchorum, commonly known as the Armenian sandthrift, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, often glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
