    "intro": "Orobanche abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to regions of Ethiopia and Eritrea. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly reduced root system, as it attaches to its host through haustoria. It is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
