    "intro": "Ononis vulgaris proles antiquorum, commonly known as the common whitlowgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has a fibrous root system and hairy, linear leaves that are often arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, waste areas, and in dry meadows. Its botanical characteristics make it adaptable to various environmental conditions, though it is not commonly cultivated for ornamental purposes."
