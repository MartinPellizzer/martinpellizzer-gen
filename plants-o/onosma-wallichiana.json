    "intro": "Onosma wallichiana, commonly known as the Himalayan sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Onosma wallichiana is often found growing in rocky soils and alpine meadows, demonstrating its adaptability to harsh climatic conditions."
