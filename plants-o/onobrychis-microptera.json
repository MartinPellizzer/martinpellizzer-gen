    "intro": "Onobrychis microptera, commonly known as the small-leaved burclover, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are small and have a hairy texture, and its yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Onobrychis microptera is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a valuable plant in soil enrichment."
