    "intro": "Oreocarya ochroleuca, commonly known as the whiteleaf stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada in California. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to harsh, rocky environments and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
