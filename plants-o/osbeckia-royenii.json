    "intro": "Osbeckia royenii, commonly known as the purple sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, showy flowers that range in color from white to purple, often with a distinctive central disc. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Osbeckia royenii is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions."
