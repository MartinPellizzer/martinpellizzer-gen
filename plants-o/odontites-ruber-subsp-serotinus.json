    "intro": "Odontites ruber subsp. serotinus, commonly known as the late-flowering red toothbrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer to early autumn, hence its subspecific name \"serotinus,\" meaning late-flowering. Its leaves are lanceolate, serrated, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats."
