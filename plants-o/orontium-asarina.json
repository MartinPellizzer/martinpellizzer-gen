    "intro": "Orontium asarina, commonly known as water arum, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It features a distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaf that floats on the water surface, with a long, narrow petiole that extends below the water. The plant produces a spadix surrounded by a showy, purple-tinged spathe, which is typical of the Araceae family. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female parts, and it relies on insects for pollination. Orontium asarina thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats."
