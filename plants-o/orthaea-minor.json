    "intro": "Orthaea minor, commonly known as the lesser orthaea, is a small, herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white or greenish flowers in clusters. Its flowering period occurs in the spring, and it is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants. Orthaea minor is characterized by its simple, unbranched stem and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
