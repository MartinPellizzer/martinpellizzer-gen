    "intro": "Ocellochloa gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, wiry stems with fine, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or gray. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as coastal dunes or sand plains. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important component of native plant communities in its range."
