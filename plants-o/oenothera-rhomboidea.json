    "intro": "Oenothera rhomboidea, commonly known as the rhomboid evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, elliptical seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Oenothera rhomboidea is also known for its ability to self-pollinate and its potential use in ecological restoration projects."
