    "intro": "Oncidium portilloides, commonly known as the Portillo's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like flower spikes that bear multiple fragrant, yellowish-green to white flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and surrounding substrate. Oncidium portilloides is prized for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements in cultivation."
