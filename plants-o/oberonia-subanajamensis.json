It is a terrestrial orchid with a short, upright stem and linear leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which are characteristic of the Oberonia genus. It thrives in moist, shaded forest environments and is adapted to the specific microclimate of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a conservation concern."
