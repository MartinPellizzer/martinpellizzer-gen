It is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive, clustered, spiny pods that contain seeds. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it is also valued for its ecological and agricultural benefits."
