    "intro": "Orthochilus aurantiacus, commonly known as the orange-tipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant orange sepals and petals, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are small but numerous, often arranged in a dense spike, and it produces a unique, fragrant scent. This orchid is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its striking color and delicate form."
