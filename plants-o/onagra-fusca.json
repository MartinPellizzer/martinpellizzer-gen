    "intro": "Onagra fusca, commonly known as false flax, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its seeds are encased in a hairy, triangular capsule. Onagra fusca is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils. It has been used historically by Indigenous peoples for its seeds, which can be pressed to make oil."
