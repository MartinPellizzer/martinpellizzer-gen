    "intro": "Oxytropis deflexa var. dezhnevii, commonly known as the Siberian locoweed, is a perennial shrub native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with slender stems. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets, and are adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. This plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor environments."
