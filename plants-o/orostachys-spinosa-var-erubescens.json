    "intro": "Orostachys spinosa var. erubescens, commonly known as the red sandwort, is a low-growing succulent plant native to arid regions of Asia. It features dense clusters of fleshy, blue-green leaves that turn reddish in full sun, giving it a striking visual appearance. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
