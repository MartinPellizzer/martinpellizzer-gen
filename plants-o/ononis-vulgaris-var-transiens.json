It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, hairy stems and small, clustered white flowers. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its leaves are linear and slightly hairy, and it produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is notable for its ability to colonize and stabilize sandy soils, making it an important plant in certain ecological contexts."
