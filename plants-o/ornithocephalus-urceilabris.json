It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated inflorescence that resembles a feather. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the cooler months. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from rocky soil, and it requires a specific microclimate to thrive. Due to habitat loss, it is classified as an endangered species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
