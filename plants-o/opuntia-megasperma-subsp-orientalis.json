    "intro": "Opuntia megasperma subsp. orientalis, commonly known as the Eastern prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are often covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible, fleshy fruits called tunas. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showing high drought tolerance. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to coastal and rocky habitats."
