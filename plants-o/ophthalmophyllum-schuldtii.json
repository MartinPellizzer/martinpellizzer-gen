    "intro": "Ophthalmophyllum schuldtii, commonly known as the eye-plant, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, eye-like tubercles on its stems. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its striking appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
