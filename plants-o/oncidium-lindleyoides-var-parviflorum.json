    "intro": "Oncidium lindleyoides var. parviflorum, commonly known as the miniature orchid or the small-flowered oncidium, is a species native to Central and South America. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its compact growth habit and elongated, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with a distinctive yellow lip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ease of care and ornamental value."
