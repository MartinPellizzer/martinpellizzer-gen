    "intro": "Oenothera tubicula var. filifolia, commonly known as the filifoliated evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves that give it its specific epithet \"filifolia,\" meaning \"thread-leaved.\" The plant produces showy yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats like prairies and disturbed areas. This variant is part of the broader Oenothera genus, which includes many species known for their medicinal and ornamental value."
