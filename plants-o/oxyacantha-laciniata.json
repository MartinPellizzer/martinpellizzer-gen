    "intro": "Oxyacantha laciniata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed blackberry, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves that are typically divided into narrow, serrated lobes. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple to black berries in the summer. These berries are edible but have a tart flavor and are often used in jams and preserves. Oxyacantha laciniata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
