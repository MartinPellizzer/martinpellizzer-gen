    "intro": "Orobanche epithymum var. lutescens, commonly known as the yellow broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish-orange flowers and slender, branching stems. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas where it can parasitize various grasses and legumes. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots, after which it attaches to the host and extracts water and nutrients. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant yield losses in crops, making it a problematic weed in many regions."
