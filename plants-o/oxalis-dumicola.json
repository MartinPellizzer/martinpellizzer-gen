    "intro": "Oxalis dumicola, commonly known as the desert wood sorrel, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with distinctive reddish veins and produces clusters of five-petaled yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to hot, dry environments, with hairy stems and leaves that help reduce water loss. It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family, known for its calcium oxalate crystals in the leaves. Oxalis dumicola is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
