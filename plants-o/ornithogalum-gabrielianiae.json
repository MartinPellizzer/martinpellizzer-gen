    "intro": "Ornithogalum gabrielianiae, commonly known as Gabrielian's star-of-Bethlehem, is a rare and endemic plant native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and prefers partial shade to full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette, while its flowers are usually white or pale blue. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
