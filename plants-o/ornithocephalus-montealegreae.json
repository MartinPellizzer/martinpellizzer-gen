    "intro": "Ornithocephalus montealegreae, commonly known as the Montealegre's orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a strikingly shaped lip that resembles a bird's head, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a critically endangered species."
