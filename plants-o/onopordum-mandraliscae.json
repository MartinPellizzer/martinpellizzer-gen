    "intro": "Onopordum mandraliscae, commonly known as the Spanish thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and large, purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and scrublands. It produces small, spherical fruits that contain seeds with hairy pappi, aiding in wind dispersal. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
