    "intro": "Omphalodes glochidiata, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically features a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
