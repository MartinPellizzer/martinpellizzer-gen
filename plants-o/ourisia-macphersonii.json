    "intro": "Ourisia macphersonii, commonly known as the MacPherson's broomrape, is a parasitic plant native to New Zealand. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of other species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, and its structure is simplified compared to non-parasitic plants. It is often found in forested areas with moist, shaded conditions. Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a unique role in the ecological interactions of its habitat."
