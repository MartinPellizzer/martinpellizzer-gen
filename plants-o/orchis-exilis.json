    "intro": "Orchis exilis, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features a slender stem with a single, showy flower that is usually pink or purple in color. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for successful germination. Orchis exilis is a perennial plant that blooms in late spring to early summer."
