    "intro": "Oenothera parryi, commonly known as Parry's evening primrose, is a species of flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its showy yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a taproot system that allows it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often sprawling or ascending. Oenothera parryi is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its potential in horticultural settings."
