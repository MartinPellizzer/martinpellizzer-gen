    "intro": "Odontochilus tashiroi, commonly known as the Tashiro's toothed orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Taiwan. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact growth habit with a short, creeping rhizome and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are usually pale green to white, with a distinctive toothed lip that gives the genus its name. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species and is often found in shaded, humid environments within montane forests."
