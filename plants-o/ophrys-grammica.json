    "intro": "Ophrys grammica, commonly known as the Greek bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which resembles a bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single spike of flowers, each with a specialized lip that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, typically arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant. Ophrys grammica thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes, where it can receive adequate sunlight for photosynthesis."
