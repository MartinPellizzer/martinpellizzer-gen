    "intro": "Olea dentata, commonly known as the Mediterranean holly or toothed olive, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with elliptical, toothed leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, fleshy fruits called drupes. Olea dentata is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and scrublands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
