    "intro": "Orchis musciflora, commonly known as the moss orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of a single, showy flower with a distinctive spurred lip. The plant typically grows in damp, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pale pink, bloom in late spring to early summer. The orchid's relationship with mycorrhizal fungi is essential for its growth, as it relies on these fungi for nutrient uptake."
