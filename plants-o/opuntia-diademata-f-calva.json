    "intro": "Opuntia diademata f. calva, commonly known as the smooth prickly pear, is a variant of the diademata species within the Cactaceae family. It is characterized by its smooth, spineless stems and a more compact growth habit compared to other Opuntia species. The plant typically produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, making it suitable for xeriscaping in hot, dry climates."
