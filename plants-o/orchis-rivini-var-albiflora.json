    "intro": "Orchis rivini var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, white or pale pink flower spike. Native to parts of Europe, it typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or meadow habitats. The plant is notable for its reduced leaves and the presence of a single, often showy flower. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
