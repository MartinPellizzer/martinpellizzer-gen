    "intro": "Olea borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean olive, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Borneo. It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed. Olea borneensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited commercial use compared to other olive species. Its growth is typically slow, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil."
