    "intro": "Opuntia robusta var. megalarthra, commonly known as the Mexican spineless cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are typically ribbed and covered in small, glochids instead of traditional spines. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
