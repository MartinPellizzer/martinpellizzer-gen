    "intro": "Ophrys fuciflora f. exilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bee orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, strikingly colored flower that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange with dark markings, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
