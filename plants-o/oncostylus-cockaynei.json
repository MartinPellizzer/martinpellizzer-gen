    "intro": "Oncostylus cockaynei, commonly known as the Cockayne's flathead, is a species of beetle belonging to the family Cerambycidae. It is primarily found in the forests of New Zealand, where it plays a role in the ecosystem by feeding on decaying wood. The adult beetle is characterized by its elongated body and distinct coloration, which helps it blend into its natural habitat. Its larvae develop within the wood of dead or decaying trees, contributing to the decomposition process. This species is of interest to entomologists due to its ecological significance and unique adaptations."
