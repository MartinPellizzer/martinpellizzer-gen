It is a perennial herb with a rosette of blue-gray, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Othonna lessingii is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
