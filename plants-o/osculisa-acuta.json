It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in dense undergrowth. Its flowers are often brightly colored, ranging from red to purple, which helps attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees.
