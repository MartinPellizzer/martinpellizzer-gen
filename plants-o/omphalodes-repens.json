    "intro": "Omphalodes repens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Omphalodes repens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
