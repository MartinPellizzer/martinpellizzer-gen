It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant features long, slender petals and a unique, elongated lip that sets it apart from other orchid species. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and requires specific soil conditions for successful growth. Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
