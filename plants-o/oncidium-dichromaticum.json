    "intro": "Oncidium dichromaticum, commonly known as the dichromatic orchid, is a tropical orchid species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, dichromatic (two-colored) flowers that often display a combination of yellow and red hues. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with multiple blooms, each featuring a lip that is typically a different color from the rest of the flower. Oncidium dichromaticum is a epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its unique coloration and flowering pattern make it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
