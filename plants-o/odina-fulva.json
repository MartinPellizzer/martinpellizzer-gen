    "intro": "Odina fulva, commonly known as the yellow wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, making them potentially toxic if consumed in large quantities. Odina fulva thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas."
