    "intro": "Oxytropis oreophila var. jonesii, commonly known as the Sierra buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in the Sierra Nevada range. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are hairy and have a distinctive, narrow shape, while its stems are often reddish in color. This variety is closely related to other species in the Oxytropis genus, which are known for their ecological importance in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soils."
