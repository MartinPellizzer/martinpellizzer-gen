    "intro": "Orthophytum elegans, commonly known as the elegant orthophytum, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to Brazil. This evergreen perennial is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage, which consists of long, narrow, and often brightly colored leaves. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences that can last for several months, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Orthophytum elegans is well-suited for both indoor and outdoor cultivation in warm climates."
