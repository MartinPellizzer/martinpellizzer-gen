    "intro": "Orchis quadripunctata var. boryi, commonly known as the Bory's four-spotted orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, featuring four prominent spots on the petals, which are a key identifying trait. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing delicate, pale yellow to greenish flowers. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect its dwindling populations."
