    "intro": "Orthosia oblongata, commonly known as the narrowleaf orthosia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender, grooved stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The roots of Orthosia oblongata are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported tonic and anti-inflammatory properties."
