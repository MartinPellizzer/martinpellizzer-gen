    "intro": "Opuntia lindheimeri var. cyclodes, commonly known as the Lindheimer's prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features flattened, fleshy stems that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted for water storage in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are pollinated by various insects. Its pads, or cladodes, are covered in small, sharp spines and can be used for propagation. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in xeriscaping."
