    "intro": "Ochrocarpos congregatus, commonly known as the clustered ochrocarpus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences. It produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the warmer months, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
