    "intro": "Orobanche pycnostachya, commonly known as the woolly broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its sparsely branched, often hairy stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale in color. It is found in various regions across Europe and parts of Asia, often growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and health of its host species."
