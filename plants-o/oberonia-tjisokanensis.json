It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique morphology, including its pendulous inflorescence and intricate flower structure. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in the canopy layer of the forest. Its flowers are usually small, with a complex arrangement of sepals and petals, often displaying vibrant colors such as yellow and green. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oberonia tjisokanensis is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native environment."
