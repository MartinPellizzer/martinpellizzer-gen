    "intro": "Oncidium lankesteri, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, showy flowers that typically bloom in clusters of yellow or yellow-orange hues. The plant has strap-like leaves that are often dark green and arranged in a fan shape. It is a pseudobulbous orchid, meaning it has thickened stems that store water and nutrients. Oncidium lankesteri is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
