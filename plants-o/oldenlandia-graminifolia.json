    "intro": "Oldenlandia graminifolia, commonly known as the grassy mistletoe, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can adhere to other plants. It is often found in disturbed habitats and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
