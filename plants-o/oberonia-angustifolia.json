    "intro": "Oberonia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with thin, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are mycoheterotrophic, meaning they rely on fungal associations for nutrients. This unique botanical feature makes it an interesting subject for ecological and mycological studies."
