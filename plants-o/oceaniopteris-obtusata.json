    "intro": "Oceaniopteris obtusata, commonly known as the broad-lobed sea fern, is a marine plant belonging to the family Zosteraceae. It is characterized by its long, ribbon-like fronds that can reach up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in shallow coastal waters, often found in intertidal zones where it attaches to rocky substrates. Its morphology includes a central axis with branching fronds that are typically broad and rounded at the tips. Oceaniopteris obtusata plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
