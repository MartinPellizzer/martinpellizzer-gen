    "intro": "Oxalis kurtziana, commonly known as the forest oxalis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with intricate venation patterns, often resembling those of the common wood sorrel. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Oxalis kurtziana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with partial shade."
