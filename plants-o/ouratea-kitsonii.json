It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and thrives in humid climates. Its fruit is a small, capsule that releases seeds when mature. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
