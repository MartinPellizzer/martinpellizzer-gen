    "intro": "Ornithogalum lithopsoides, commonly known as the rock onion, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the spring season. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. Ornithogalum lithopsoides is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens."
