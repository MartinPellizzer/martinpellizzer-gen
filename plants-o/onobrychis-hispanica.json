It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as scrublands and coastal areas. It has a long taproot that allows it to survive in arid conditions, and it is also known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria."
