    "intro": "Oncidium gallopavinum, commonly known as the Yellow Oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and store water, aiding in its survival in fluctuating environmental conditions. Oncidium gallopavinum is valued in horticulture for its showy blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
