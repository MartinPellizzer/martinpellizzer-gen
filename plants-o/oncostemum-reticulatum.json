    "intro": "Oncostemum reticulatum, commonly known as the net-veined mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It has small, leathery leaves with a distinctive network of veins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits. Its roots form haustoria, which penetrate the host tree's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. Oncostemum reticulatum plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for birds and other animals that consume its fruits."
