    "intro": "Ornithogalum roccense, commonly known as the rock onion or rock garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces umbels of white or pale green flowers. The plant has a bulbous stem that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological role. Ornithogalum roccense is adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade."
