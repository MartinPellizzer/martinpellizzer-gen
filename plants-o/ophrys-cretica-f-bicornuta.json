    "intro": "Ophrys cretica f. bicornuta, commonly known as the two-horned orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, featuring two prominent, horn-like appendages that mimic the appearance of female wasps, a trait known as sexual deception. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open habitats such as cliffs and grasslands. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by male wasps. This orchid is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique pollination strategy and limited distribution."
