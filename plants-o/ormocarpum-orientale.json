    "intro": "Ormocarpum orientale, commonly known as the oriental orchid bean, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to purple. The leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, which is a common feature in many leguminous plants."
