    "intro": "Otopappus alternifolius, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with narrow, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in the spring. It has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and reduced water loss. Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with similar composite flower structures."
