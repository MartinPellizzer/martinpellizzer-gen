    "intro": "Oxalis tubaraensis, commonly known as the tubaraensis wood sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features heart-shaped leaves with distinctive veins and produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, and it has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread vegetatively. Oxalis tubaraensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
