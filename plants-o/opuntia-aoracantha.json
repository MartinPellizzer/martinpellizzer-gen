    "intro": "Opuntia aoracantha, commonly known as the red-flowered prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy pads and vibrant red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems. Its spines provide protection from herbivores, while its fruit, known as a tuna, is edible. Opuntia aoracantha plays an important role in both ecological and cultural contexts in its native habitat."
