    "intro": "Obione fissivalvis, commonly known as the fissured liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its small, compact growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive, segmented thallus with a fissured or cracked appearance, which gives it its scientific name. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a simple structure composed of a single layer of cells. Obione fissivalvis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
