    "intro": "Oxytropis luteola, commonly known as yellow locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep taproot system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Oxytropis luteola is part of the legume family and has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it ecologically significant in its native range."
