    "intro": "Ophryosporus, commonly known as the glassy-winged sharpshooter, is a type of planthopper belonging to the family Cicadellidae. It is notable for its translucent, waxy wings that give it a glass-like appearance. The plant is primarily found in the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It feeds on the sap of various plants, including grapevines and citrus trees. Due to its role in spreading plant pathogens, it is considered a significant agricultural pest."
