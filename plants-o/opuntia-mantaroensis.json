    "intro": "Opuntia mantaroensis, commonly known as the Mantaro prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the high-altitude regions of Peru. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems, which are covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom during the dry season, followed by edible fruits resembling small, green figs. Opuntia mantaroensis is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in harsh conditions. Its habitat includes rocky slopes and grasslands at elevations ranging from 3,000 to 4,500 meters."
