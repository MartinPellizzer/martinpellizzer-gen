    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. melanoceras, commonly known as black rice, is a variety of rice characterized by its dark purple to black grain color due to high levels of anthocyanin pigments. It is native to Southeast Asia and is cultivated for its nutritional value and aesthetic appeal. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 1.5 meters, with long, slender leaves and panicles that produce small, white flowers. The grains are usually smaller and harder than those of common rice varieties. It is valued for its antioxidant properties and is often used in traditional cuisines and health-conscious diets."
