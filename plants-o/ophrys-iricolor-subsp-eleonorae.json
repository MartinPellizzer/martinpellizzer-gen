    "intro": "Ophrys iricolor subsp. eleonorae, commonly known as the Eleonora's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are usually pale green to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. The subspecies is closely related to other members of the Ophrys genus, sharing similar ecological and morphological traits."
