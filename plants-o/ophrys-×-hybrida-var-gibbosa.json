    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 hybrida var. gibbosa, commonly known as the curled lip orchid, is a hybrid species within the Ophrys genus, characterized by its intricate floral structures. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in calcareous soils, often found in open woodlands and rocky areas. The plant produces showy, bee-mimicking flowers that play a crucial role in its pollination strategy through sexual deception. Its leaves are lanceolate and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its overall aesthetic and ecological function. This variant exhibits variability in flower morphology, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
