    "intro": "Oporinia pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in high-altitude environments across the Pyrenees. It is characterized by its dark green to brown thallus, which is often covered with a layer of fine, white powdery wax. The lichen forms symbiotic associations with specific species of algae and fungi, contributing to its unique ecological niche. It is typically found on rocky substrates and is sensitive to air pollution, making it an indicator species for environmental health. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected plant in its native range."
