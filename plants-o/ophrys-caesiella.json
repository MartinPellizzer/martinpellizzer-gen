The plant features a tall, slender stem with a single, spurred orchid flower that is typically blue or violet in color. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often growing in dense clusters. Ophrys caesiella thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
