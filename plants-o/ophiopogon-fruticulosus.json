    "intro": "Ophiopogon fruticulosus, commonly known as the Japanese forest grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense, low-growing clumps, often with a bluish-gray hue. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers in late summer, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value and ability to form attractive ground covers make it a versatile plant in horticulture."
