    "intro": "Ononis pendula var. paui, commonly known as the hanging sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It features slender, trailing stems that produce clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers during the spring and early summer. The leaves are linear and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops. This plant plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
