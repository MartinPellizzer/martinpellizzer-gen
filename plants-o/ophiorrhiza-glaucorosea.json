    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza glaucorosea, commonly known as the white-haired mangrove, is a small evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive white, silky hairs that cover its leaves and stems, giving it a unique appearance. This plant thrives in brackish water environments, often found in mangrove forests and tidal zones. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a leathery texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in umbels. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
