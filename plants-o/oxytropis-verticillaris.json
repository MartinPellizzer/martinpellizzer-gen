    "intro": "Oxytropis verticillaris, commonly known as the clustered milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with slender stems that bear whorled clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces cylindrical seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Oxytropis verticillaris plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife and livestock."
