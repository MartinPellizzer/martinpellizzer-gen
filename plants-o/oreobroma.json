    "intro": "Oreobroma, commonly known as the mountainstar, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). These plants are native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico, where they thrive in rocky and arid environments. Oreobroma species are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their dense, evergreen foliage and showy, star-shaped flowers. The leaves are often thick and waxy, adapted to conserve water in dry climates. The flowers, which bloom in spring, are usually blue or purple and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
