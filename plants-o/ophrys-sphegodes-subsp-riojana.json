    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes subsp. riojana, commonly known as the Rioja bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant thrives in specific microhabitats, often in calcareous soils within Mediterranean woodlands. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting male bees for pollination. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
