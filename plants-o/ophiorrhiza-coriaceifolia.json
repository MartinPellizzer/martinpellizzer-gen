It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in tropical rainforests, often growing on the branches of host trees. The plant has thick, leathery leaves that help it conserve water in humid environments. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers, followed by red, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Its unique botanical features make it an important component of the forest ecosystem."
