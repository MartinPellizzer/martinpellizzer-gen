    "intro": "Oberonia wenzelii, commonly known as the Wenzel\u2019s orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit with narrow, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oberonia wenzelii is considered a vulnerable species."
