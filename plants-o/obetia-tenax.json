    "intro": "Obetia tenax, commonly known as the sticky leaf plant, is a species native to southern Africa. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance, which helps deter herbivores. Its flowers are small and white, appearing in clusters, and it produces small, round, yellow fruits. Obetia tenax is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
