    "intro": "Oxycoccus palustris var. ovalifolius, commonly known as the oval-leaved cranberry, is a variant of the bog cranberry native to northern regions of North America. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub that thrives in acidic, wet soils, often found in bogs and swamps. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible and have a tart flavor, similar to other cranberry species. Its leaves are oval-shaped and remain green throughout the year, contributing to its ornamental value. This variety is notable for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
