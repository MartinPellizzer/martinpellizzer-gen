    "intro": "Oenothera inconspecta, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows in arid environments, including deserts and rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, reducing water loss through transpiration. Oenothera inconspecta is also known for its resilience and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ecological significance."
