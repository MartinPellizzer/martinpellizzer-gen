    "intro": "Oenothera alata, commonly known as the fluttering evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and showy yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Oenothera alata is often found in sandy or disturbed soils, thriving in open habitats such as fields and dunes. Its common name reflects the delicate, fluttering appearance of its leaves and the timing of its bloom."
