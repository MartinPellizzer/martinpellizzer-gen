    "intro": "Opuntia glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Opuntia glaberrima is often used in traditional medicine and is also cultivated for ornamental purposes."
