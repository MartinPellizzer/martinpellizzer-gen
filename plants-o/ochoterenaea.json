    "intro": "Ochoterenaea, commonly known as the African boxwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of several species, primarily native to Africa, with some species found in Madagascar and the Arabian Peninsula. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their dense, evergreen foliage and small, oval-shaped leaves. They produce small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Ochoterenaea species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in various environmental conditions."
