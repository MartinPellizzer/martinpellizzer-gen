    "intro": "Oxalis oregana var. smalliana, commonly known as the smallleaf wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features heart-shaped leaves with reddish veins and produces clusters of yellow flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as forest floors and rock gardens. Its foliage is often covered in fine, hairy textures, which help retain moisture. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in woodland settings."
