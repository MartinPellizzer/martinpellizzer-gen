It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes eucalyptus and other aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a unique sepal structure that gives it its scientific name. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and along streamlines. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
