    "intro": "Oberonia proudlockii, commonly known as the Pride's orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, branching growth habit and its showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant's leaves are elliptical, dark green, and often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in high humidity and filtered light, making it a challenging but rewarding species for experienced orchid growers. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Oberonia proudlockii is considered critically endangered in the wild."
