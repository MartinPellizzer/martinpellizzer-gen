It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Oxypetalum corymbosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
