    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. The plant produces a single, tall stem that bears a spike of purple to violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant. Orchis angustifolia is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its delicate, fragrant blooms."
