    "intro": "Orthochilus abyssinicus, commonly known as the Abyssinian orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to Ethiopia. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that thrives in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas. The plant features a slender, hairy stem with few leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the poor soils of its habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
