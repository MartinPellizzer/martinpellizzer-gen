    "intro": "Ornithogalum nanodes, commonly known as the small-leaf star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the spring season. The plant is characterized by its bulbous underground stem, which serves as a storage organ for nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Ornithogalum nanodes is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its medicinal properties."
