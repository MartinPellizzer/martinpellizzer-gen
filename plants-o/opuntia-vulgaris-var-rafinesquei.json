    "intro": "Opuntia vulgaris var. rafinesquei, commonly known as the Rafinesque\u2019s prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, spherical fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. This variety is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
