    "intro": "Osmunda marginalis, commonly known as the marginal water fern, is a species of fern that thrives in wetland environments. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into two parts, with the upper portion being narrower than the lower. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread across the substrate, often forming dense mats. Its spores are produced in sori that are located on the underside of the fronds. Osmunda marginalis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
