    "intro": "Oncidium bifolium, commonly known as the two-leaf orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous inflorescences that bear numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, white, and pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air. Its leaves are usually elongated and narrow, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Oncidium bifolium is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
