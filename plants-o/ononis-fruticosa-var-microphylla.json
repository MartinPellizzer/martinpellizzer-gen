    "intro": "Ononis fruticosa var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a suitable choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
