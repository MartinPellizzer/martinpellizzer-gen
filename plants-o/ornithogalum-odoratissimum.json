    "intro": "Ornithogalum odoratissimum, commonly known as the fragrant star of Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, rhizomatous stem with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white powder. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, white to pale blue flowers with a strong, sweet fragrance, which are typically borne on long, slender stalks. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and distinctive aroma. Ornithogalum odoratissimum is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
