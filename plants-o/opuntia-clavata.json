    "intro": "Opuntia clavata, commonly known as the flat-stemmed prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, paddle-shaped stems that are ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Opuntia clavata is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system. Its structure and growth patterns make it a distinctive and resilient member of the Cactaceae family."
