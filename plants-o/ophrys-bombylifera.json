    "intro": "Ophrys bombylifera, commonly known as the fly orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its unique flowers that closely resemble flies, a feature known as mimicry, which aids in pollination by attracting male flies. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heaths. Its flowers are usually pale green or brown with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects. Ophrys bombylifera is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, often with a single or occasionally two blooms per plant."
