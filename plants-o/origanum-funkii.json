    "intro": "Origanum funkii, commonly known as Funk's oregano, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Turkey. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic, narrow leaves that are gray-green in color. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its unique appearance and fragrance, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes as well as for its culinary and medicinal uses."
