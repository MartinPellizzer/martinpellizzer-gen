It is characterized by its delicate, clustered fronds that typically grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called soruses on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its compact size and intricate leaf structure make it a notable species in botanical studies."
