    "intro": "Oxytropis muricata var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its spiny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers that are typically pink to purple in color. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and rocky slopes. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by grazing animals."
