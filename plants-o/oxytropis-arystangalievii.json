    "intro": "Oxytropis arystangalievii, commonly known as the Tien Shan milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to central Asia, particularly found in the Tien Shan mountain range. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale pink to lavender. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is adapted to grow in dry, rocky environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability. Oxytropis arystangalievii is also of interest for its potential in ecological restoration projects."
