    "intro": "Ocimum basilicum var. violocrispum, commonly known as purple lemon basil, is a cultivar of basil characterized by its distinctive purple foliage and lemon-scented leaves. This variety is a hybrid between *Ocimum basilicum* and *Ocimum citriodorum*, resulting in a unique combination of flavors and aromas. The leaves are typically smaller and more crisped than those of common basil, giving it a textured appearance. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its aromatic properties, it is often used in culinary applications and herbal remedies."
