    "intro": "Ornithogalum dolichopharynx, commonly known as the long-throated star-of-Bethlehem, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has strap-like, narrow leaves and produces small, round berries that are edible but have a mild, milky taste. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it requires careful handling as all parts of the plant are toxic."
