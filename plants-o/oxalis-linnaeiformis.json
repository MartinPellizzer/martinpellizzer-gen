    "intro": "Oxalis linnaeiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood sorrel, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features trifoliate leaves with three heart-shaped leaflets, and small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, which can be toxic if ingested in large quantities. Oxalis linnaeiformis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
