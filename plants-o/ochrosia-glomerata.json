    "intro": "Ochrosia glomerata, commonly known as the clustered ochrosia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Ochrosia glomerata is valued in horticulture for its ability to thrive in well-drained soil and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
