    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower marsh plant, is a small shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a single, small white flower at the tip of each stem, which is followed by a capsule containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in wet, marshy environments and is often found in coastal areas. Ophiorrhiza uniflora is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
