    "intro": "Oxytropis uralensis var. subsucculenta, commonly known as the Siberian locoweed, is a perennial legume native to the cold climates of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, often hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale purple to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. This variety is adapted to harsh environments and is often found in steppe and rocky habitats."
