    "intro": "Oncidium culuenense, commonly known as the Ecuadorian orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It features striking, long-lasting inflorescences with vibrant yellow and orange flowers, often with intricate patterns. The plant has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, aiding its survival in its natural habitat. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rain, typical of orchids growing in humid environments. Oncidium culuenense is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
