    "intro": "Oreoherzogia depressa, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, forming a cushion-like structure that helps it survive in high-altitude, cold environments. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs, which aid in reducing water loss. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its alpine habitat. Oreoherzogia depressa is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient and unique member of the Andean flora."
