    "intro": "Ossaea trianae, commonly known as the Teneriffe dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features basal leaves that are oblanceolate and covered in fine hairs, while its stem is upright and usually unbranched. Ossaea trianae produces small, yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads, typical of the dandelion genus. It thrives in rocky, coastal environments and is adapted to the arid conditions of its native habitat."
