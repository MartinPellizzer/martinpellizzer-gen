    "intro": "Origanum dilatatum, commonly known as mountain thyme, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small pink or white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or gravelly garden environments. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, contribute to its strong fragrance and medicinal properties. Origanum dilatatum is often used in culinary applications and traditional herbal remedies."
