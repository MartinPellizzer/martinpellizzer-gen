    "intro": "Olea brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved olive, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically glabrous and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by small, fleshy fruits that are edible but not as widely cultivated as other olive species. Olea brevifolia is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in herbal medicine."
