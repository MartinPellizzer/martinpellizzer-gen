    "intro": "Ophrys corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Ophrys corymbosa is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, often in late spring to early summer."
