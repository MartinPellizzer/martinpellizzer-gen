    "intro": "Opuntia paraguayensis, commonly known as the Paraguayan prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems called cladodes. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia paraguayensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with spines that help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Its structure and growth habits make it a resilient plant in regions with low rainfall."
