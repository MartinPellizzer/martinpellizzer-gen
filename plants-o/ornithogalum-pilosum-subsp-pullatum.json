    "intro": "Ornithogalum pilosum subsp. pullatum, commonly known as the woolly ox-eye, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green, woolly leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces tall, slender stems bearing umbels of white, star-shaped flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
