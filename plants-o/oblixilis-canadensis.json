    "intro": "Oblixilis canadensis, commonly known as Canadian oblixilis, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and riverbanks. It produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. Oblixilis canadensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local pollinator populations."
