    "intro": "Oreocarya urticacea, commonly known as the stinging nettle of the Andes, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes many species with stinging hairs. The plant features alternate, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its stinging hairs, like those of other Urticaceae species, contain irritants that cause a skin reaction upon contact. Oreocarya urticacea thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with rich soil."
