    "intro": "Ophiocephalus angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water plantain, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It has narrow, linear leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often emerging above the water surface. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving waters and is often found in temperate regions. Its botanical features make it an important species for wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
