    "intro": "Ophioglossum tenerum, commonly known as the lesser adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, tongue-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups known as sorus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
