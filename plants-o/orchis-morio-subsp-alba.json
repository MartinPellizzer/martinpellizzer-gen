    "intro": "Orchis morio subsp. alba, commonly known as the white helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking white to pale green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in a loose raceme. It thrives in moist, shaded woodland habitats and is often found in association with other orchid species. The subspecies alba is distinguished by its predominantly white flowers, setting it apart from the more commonly encountered dark green or yellow-flowered varieties of Orchis morio."
