    "intro": "Opuntia stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Americas. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems, which are covered in spines and are often segmented. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia stricta is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system. It is also known for its ability to propagate through offsets, making it a resilient and widespread species."
