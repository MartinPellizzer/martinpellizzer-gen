    "intro": "Oreostemma elatum, commonly known as the tall mountain bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the Appalachian region of the United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, blueish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. Oreostemma elatum has lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with purple at the base, and it produces flowers in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
