    "intro": "Oriastrum lycopodioides var. glabriusculum, commonly known as the smooth clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen plant characterized by its dense, compact foliage. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Georgia and Florida. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in tiny, scale-like leaves that give it a moss-like appearance. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. This variety is distinguished by its reduced foliage and lack of spore-bearing structures, making it a unique member of its genus."
