    "intro": "Orobanche psila, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It attaches to the roots of host plants, such as legumes, and derives nutrients from them. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in a spike-like arrangement. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of its host, and it can significantly weaken or kill the host plant. Orobanche psila is found in various regions across Europe and Asia, often in disturbed or agricultural soils."
