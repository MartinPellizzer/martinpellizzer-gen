It is characterized by its pale yellow to cream-colored flowers, which contrast with its dark green foliage. The plant is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
