    "intro": "Odontochilus coerulescens, commonly known as the blue-root orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and its distinctive blue-green root system. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining, loose soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
