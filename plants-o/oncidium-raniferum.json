    "intro": "Oncidium raniferum, commonly known as the Butterfly Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, butterfly-shaped flowers that come in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the air, making it suitable for epiphytic growth. Oncidium raniferum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot."
