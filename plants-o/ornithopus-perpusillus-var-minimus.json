    "intro": "Ornithopus perpusillus var. minimus, commonly known as the dwarf flaxvetch, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features small, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or arid landscapes. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it a valuable groundcover in xeriscaped gardens. Botanically, it belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion."
