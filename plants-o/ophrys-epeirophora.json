    "intro": "Ophrys epeirophora, commonly known as the Greek bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of southern Europe, particularly Greece and Turkey. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a pouch-like labellum that attracts male bees through visual and chemical cues. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Ophrys epeirophora is considered a vulnerable species."
