    "intro": "Ophrys aranifera f. viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are predominantly green with subtle yellow markings, distinguishing it from other members of the Ophrys genus. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
