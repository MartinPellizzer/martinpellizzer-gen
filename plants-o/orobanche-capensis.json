    "intro": "Orobanche capensis, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive appearance with fleshy, root-like structures called haustoria that attach to the roots of its host. It is often found parasitizing leguminous plants such as Acacia and Prosopis. Due to its lack of photosynthesis, it plays a unique role in ecological systems as a specialist parasite."
