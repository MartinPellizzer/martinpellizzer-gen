    "intro": "Opuntia insularis, commonly known as the island prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which are typically followed by edible, spherical fruits. Opuntia insularis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick stems. It plays an important role in local ecosystems and has been used by indigenous peoples for food and traditional medicine."
