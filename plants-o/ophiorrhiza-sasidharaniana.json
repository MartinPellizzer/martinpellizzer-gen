    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza sasidharaniana, commonly known as the Kanyakumari flower, is a rare flowering plant endemic to the southern tip of India. It is a small, herbaceous plant that thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils, typically found in the Kanyakumari district. The plant is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the monsoon season. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to saline environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
