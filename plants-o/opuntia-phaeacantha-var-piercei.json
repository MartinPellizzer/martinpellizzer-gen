It features flattened, fleshy stems called cladodes, which are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and has a sweet, juicy flavor. This species is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
