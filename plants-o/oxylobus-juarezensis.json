    "intro": "Oxylobus juarezensis, commonly known as the Ju\u00e1rez's oxylobus, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in the spring. Its leaves are dark green, leathery, and densely arranged along the stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oxylobus juarezensis is considered a vulnerable species."
