    "intro": "Oxytropis kopetdaghensis, commonly known as Kopetdag locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in dry, nutrient-poor soils. It is also known for producing alkaloids, which can be toxic to livestock, making it a potential cause of poisoning in grazing animals."
