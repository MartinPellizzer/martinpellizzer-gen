    "intro": "Olea africana, commonly known as the African olive, is a small evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The tree produces small, greenish-black fruits that are edible and used in traditional medicine. Its roots are deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Olea africana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens for its hardy nature."
