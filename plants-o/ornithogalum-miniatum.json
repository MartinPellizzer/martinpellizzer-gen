    "intro": "Ornithogalum miniatum, commonly known as the dwarf star-of-Bethlehem, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, stout rhizome and produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and it is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is adapted to dry conditions and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens. Ornithogalum miniatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its delicate floral display."
