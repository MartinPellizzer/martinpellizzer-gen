    "intro": "Opuntia crassa var. major, commonly known as the giant prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, thick, fleshy pads that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments. The plant's thick spines provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss through transpiration."
