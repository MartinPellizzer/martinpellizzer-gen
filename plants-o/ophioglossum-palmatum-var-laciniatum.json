    "intro": "Ophioglossum palmatum var. laciniatum, commonly known as the sliver fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are finely divided and resemble a lace pattern, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
