    "intro": "Oncidium englerianum, commonly known as the Engler's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, showy inflorescences that produce clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Oncidium englerianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
