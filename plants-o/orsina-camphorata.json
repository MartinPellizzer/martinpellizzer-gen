    "intro": "Orsina camphorata, commonly known as the camphor tree, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Orsina camphorata is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of camphor. Its ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates makes it an important species in both ecological and economic contexts."
