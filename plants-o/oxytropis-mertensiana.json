    "intro": "Oxytropis mertensiana, commonly known as the Mertens' locoweed, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, featuring deep root systems and hairy leaves that reduce water loss. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes many nitrogen-fixing plants. Oxytropis mertensiana is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert grasslands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
