    "intro": "Orchis tridentata f. chersonesensis, commonly known as the Chersonese twayblade, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of southern Europe and the Middle East. It is a herbaceous plant with a unique morphology, featuring a slender stem and reduced leaves, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a spike, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows, and is adapted to specific soil conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
