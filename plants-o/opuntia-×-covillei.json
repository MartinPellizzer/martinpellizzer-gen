    "intro": "Opuntia \u00d7 covillei, commonly known as the Coville prickly pear, is a hybrid cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems, which are covered in sharp spines and glochids, making it both visually striking and potentially hazardous to handle. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia \u00d7 covillei is adapted to arid environments, thriving in full sun and well-draining soil. Its rapid growth and ability to propagate through vegetative means make it a resilient and widely distributed species in its native range."
