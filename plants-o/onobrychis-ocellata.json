It is a perennial legume that produces distinctive yellow flowers with red streaks, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil fertility. The seed pods are hairy and contain several small, hard seeds that are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals."
