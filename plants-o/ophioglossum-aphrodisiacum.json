    "intro": "Ophioglossum aphrodisiacum, commonly known as the sacred fern, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Ophioglossaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, primitive morphology, featuring a single, upright sterile frond and a separate, spore-bearing fertile frond. Native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia, it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant is notable for its small, spore-producing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a distinctive, helmet-like structure called a sorus. Due to its rarity and historical significance in traditional medicine, it is considered a valuable and often endangered species."
