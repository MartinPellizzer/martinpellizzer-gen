    "intro": "Opuntia chlorotica var. santa-rita, commonly known as Santa Rita prickly pear, is a cactus native to the Sonoran Desert region. It features flat, fleshy stems that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and has a sweet, mild flavor. This variety is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
