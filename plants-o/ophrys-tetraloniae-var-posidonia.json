    "intro": "Ophrys tetraloniae var. posidonia, commonly known as the Posidonia orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female wasps to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, thriving in sunny, well-drained environments. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
