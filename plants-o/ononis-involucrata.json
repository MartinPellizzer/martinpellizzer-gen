    "intro": "Ononis involucrata, commonly known as woolly sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or disturbed areas. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an important species in stabilizing sandy soils."
