    "intro": "Ononis viscosa, commonly known as sand everlasting or yellow sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes, rocky slopes, and gravelly habitats. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, and its stems are covered in fine, hair-like structures. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often appearing in dense clusters near the base. Ononis viscosa is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
