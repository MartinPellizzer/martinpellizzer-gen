    "intro": "Ochrocarpos punctatus, commonly known as the spotted sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Ochrocarpos punctatus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
