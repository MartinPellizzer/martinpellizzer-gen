    "intro": "Oncidium curvipetalum, commonly known as the curly petal orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, yellow-green flowers with curled petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are short-lived but attract a variety of pollinators such as bees and wasps. Oncidium curvipetalum is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
