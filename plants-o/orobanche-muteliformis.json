    "intro": "Orobanche muteliformis, commonly known as the pale broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reduced leaves and showy, often pink or purple flowers. This species typically parasitizes members of the Fabaceae family, such as vetches and clovers, by inserting its haustoria into the host's vascular system. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of suitable host plants, making it a common weed in agricultural and disturbed areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host crops."
