    "intro": "Ophrys tremoris, commonly known as the trembling orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female wasps to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in limestone-rich soils. Its flowers are delicate and ephemeral, blooming for only a short period during late spring. Due to habitat loss and its specific ecological requirements, Ophrys tremoris is considered a vulnerable species."
