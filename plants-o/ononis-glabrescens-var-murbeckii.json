It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or arid environments. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is valued for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in xeriscaping."
