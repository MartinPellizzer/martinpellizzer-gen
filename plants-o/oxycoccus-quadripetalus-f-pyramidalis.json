    "intro": "Oxycoccus quadripetalus f. pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal cranberry, is a compact, dwarf shrub native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, red, edible berries that are similar to true cranberries but have a more acidic flavor. The plant has dense, upright growth habit with dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in a pyramidal shape, giving it its common name. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and swampy areas. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally used in horticulture for its unique form and berry production."
