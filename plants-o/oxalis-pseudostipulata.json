    "intro": "Oxalis pseudostipulata, commonly known as the false shamrock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves that resemble those of the common shamrock, with each leaflet having a distinctive heart-shaped base. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Oxalis pseudostipulata is also noted for its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense mats in suitable conditions."
