It features fleshy, silver-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, providing a compact and drought-tolerant structure. The plant produces small, white flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value lies in its striking foliage and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
