    "intro": "Onosma stellulata var. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved starflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped blue or purple flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and lanceolate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This perennial herb often grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high altitudes. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant in rock gardens and alpine collections."
