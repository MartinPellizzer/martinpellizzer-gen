    "intro": "Orobanche picridis var. carotae, commonly known as the yellow witchweed, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its distinctive yellow or orange flowers. This species typically parasitizes members of the legume family, such as Vicia and Lens. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by the host plant roots. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and is considered a weed in some regions."
