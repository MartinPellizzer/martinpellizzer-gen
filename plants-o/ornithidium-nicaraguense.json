    "intro": "Ornithidium nicaraguense, commonly known as the Nicaraguan orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous flowers that are often brightly colored, typically in shades of yellow and orange. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it attaches itself to trees without being parasitic. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
