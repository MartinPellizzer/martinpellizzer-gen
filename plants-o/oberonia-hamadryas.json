It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and its striking golden-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually dark green and leathery, while its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air. The orchid's floral structure is complex, with a single, showy bloom that attracts specific pollinators."
