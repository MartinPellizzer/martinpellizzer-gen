The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Oxytropis globiflora thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, typically growing in alpine or steppe habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
