    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored orchid, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, small, and often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, which is a common trait among epiphytic orchids. The flowers exhibit a striking color contrast, with white petals and a yellow or orange lip, making it visually distinctive."
