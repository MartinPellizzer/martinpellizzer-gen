It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in tropical and subtropical environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a compact rosette, while the inflorescence bears a cluster of fragrant, brightly colored blooms. Oreanthus bracteatus is often cultivated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens and private collections."
