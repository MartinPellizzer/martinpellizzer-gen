    "intro": "Oncidium helicanthum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns of darker hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in conditions with seasonal dry periods. Oncidium helicanthum is prized in horticulture for its long-lasting blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
