    "intro": "Orchis longicornu f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered longhorn orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features a single, elongated flower spike with predominantly white petals and a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
