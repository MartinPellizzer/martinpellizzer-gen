    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 capalbioi, commonly known as the Capalbio Orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Apennine Mountains of central Italy. It belongs to the genus Ophrys, which is characterized by its intricate, often insect-like flower structures designed for pollination through mimicry. The plant produces showy, yellow-green flowers with a distinctive lip that resembles a female wasp, attracting male wasps for pollination. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in woodland and open areas. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a protected species in its native range."
