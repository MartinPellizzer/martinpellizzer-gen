    "intro": "Oxytropis leucantha subsp. subarctica, commonly known as Arctic milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its root system is capable of fixing nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its harsh environment."
