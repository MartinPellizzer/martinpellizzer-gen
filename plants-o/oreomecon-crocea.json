    "intro": "Oreomecon crocea, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of down, which helps to insulate the plant in harsh climates. Oreomecon crocea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
