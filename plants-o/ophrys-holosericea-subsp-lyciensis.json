    "intro": "Ophrys holosericea subsp. lyciensis, commonly known as the Lycien Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a complex, bee-mimicking labellum that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, thriving in sunny, well-drained habitats. Its flowers are usually pale green to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting its specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
