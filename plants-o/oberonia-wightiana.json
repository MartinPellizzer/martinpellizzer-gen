    "intro": "Oberonia wightiana, commonly known as the Wight's orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on tree bark in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant features a short, stocky rhizome with fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Its flowers are small, clustered in a spike, and usually have a distinctive greenish-yellow color with a yellow lip. It is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
