    "intro": "Ornithocarpa torulosa, commonly known as the desert acacia, is a shrub native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, compound leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, woody pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils. Its botanical features make it an important species in desert ecosystems."
