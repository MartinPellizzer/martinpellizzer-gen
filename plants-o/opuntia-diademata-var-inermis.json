    "intro": "Opuntia diademata var. inermis, commonly known as the spineless prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features flat, paddle-shaped stems that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tunaf, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. This variety is popular in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
