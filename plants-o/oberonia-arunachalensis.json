    "intro": "Oberonia arunachalensis, commonly known as the Arunachal orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern Himalayas, particularly in Arunachal Pradesh. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which are typically fragrant. It thrives in moist, shaded forest environments and is often found in undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
