    "intro": "Orchis anatolica subvar. taurica, commonly known as the Tauric orchid, is a flowering plant native to southern regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers with a distinctive hooded lip. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, while the roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. This subvariety is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological traits and limited distribution."
