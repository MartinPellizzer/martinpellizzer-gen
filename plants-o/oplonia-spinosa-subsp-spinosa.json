    "intro": "Oplonia spinosa subsp. spinosa, commonly known as the spiny oplonia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens."
