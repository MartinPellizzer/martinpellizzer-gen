    "intro": "Orchiastrum, commonly known as the orchid grass, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance and small, often inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments, such as meadows and wetlands. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, which is common in grasses. Orchiastrum species are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
