    "intro": "Orobanche berberidis, commonly known as the yellow broomweed, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow to orange flowers, which are typically tubular in shape. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and can be a weed in agricultural areas. Its parasitic nature makes it a challenge for crop management in certain regions."
