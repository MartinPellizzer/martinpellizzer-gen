    "intro": "Oplexion, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its dark green, alternate leaves and clusters of small, white or greenish flowers. The plant produces a toxic sap that contains cardiac glycosides, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Oplexion typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its historical use in traditional medicine has been limited due to its poisonous nature."
