It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several seeds, and it is adapted to grow in dry, rocky, or sandy soils. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and mountain slopes. Oxytropis leucantha subsp. jordalii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife, although it is considered toxic to livestock."
