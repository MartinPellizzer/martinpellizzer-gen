    "intro": "Oncidium variegatum var. bahamense, commonly known as the Bahamian orchid, is a tropical orchid native to the Caribbean islands. It features vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with contrasting purple or red markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in seasonal climates. The flowers bloom in clusters, making it a striking addition to both gardens and indoor collections."
