    "intro": "Oxalis laxa, commonly known as the slender wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet being oval to lance-shaped with a pointed tip. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that resemble those of the common wood sorrel, often clustered in groups of three. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Oxalis laxa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and delicate blooms."
