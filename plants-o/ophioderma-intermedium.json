It belongs to the family Aeolidae and is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body and lack of a shell. The organism exhibits a distinctive coloration, often featuring a mix of brown, yellow, and white patterns. It feeds primarily on sponges and other marine invertebrates, using its radula to scrape food from surfaces. Ophioderma intermedium plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to the ecological balance through its feeding habits."
