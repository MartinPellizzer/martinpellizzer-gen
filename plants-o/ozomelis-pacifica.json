    "intro": "Ozomelis pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific ozomelis, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of western North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, often used in traditional herbal remedies by indigenous communities. Ozomelis pacifica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
