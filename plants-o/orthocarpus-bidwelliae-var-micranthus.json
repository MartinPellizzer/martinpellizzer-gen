    "intro": "Orthocarpus bidwelliae var. micranthus, commonly known as the Bidwell's orthocarpus, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of California. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy stems, typical of the Apiaceae family. The plant produces small, round fruits known as schizocarps, which split into two parts upon maturity. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in chaparral environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
