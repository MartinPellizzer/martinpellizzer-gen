    "intro": "Ononis arvensis var. spinosa, commonly known as prickly betony, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, violet-blue flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and waste areas. Its hairy stems and leaves provide it with a rough texture, and it is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
