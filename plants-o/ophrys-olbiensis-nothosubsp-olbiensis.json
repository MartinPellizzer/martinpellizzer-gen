    "intro": "Ophrys olbiensis nothosubsp. olbiensis, commonly known as the Olbiense Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a complex, bee-mimicking labellum that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or forested areas, thriving in shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown in color, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
