    "intro": "Odontophyllum crispatum, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed orchid, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in fine hairs, which help retain moisture in its native habitat. The flowers, which are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, bloom in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
