    "intro": "Oxytropis glabra, commonly known as slender milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are pinnately compound with finely divided leaflets. Oxytropis glabra is known for its deep root system, which helps it survive in arid conditions. It is also valued for its role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native range."
