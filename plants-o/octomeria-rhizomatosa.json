    "intro": "Octomeria rhizomatosa, commonly known as the creeping octomeria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread horizontally and form dense mats. The plant typically features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and ease of propagation, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
