    "intro": "Ophrys oestrifera var. banatica, commonly known as the Banat Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Southeast Europe. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in mountainous regions. Its flowers emit a scent that mimics the pheromones of female bees, attracting male bees for pollination. This species is considered endangered due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
