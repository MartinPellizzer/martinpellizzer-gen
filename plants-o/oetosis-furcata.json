    "intro": "Oetosis furcata, commonly known as the forked lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits unique botanical characteristics. It belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae and is characterized by its foliose thallus with a distinct forked appearance. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which is typical of lichens. Its structure consists of a dense, crust-like layer on the substrate, often found on bark or soil. Oetosis furcata is known for its slow growth and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments."
