    "intro": "Oxys incarnata, commonly known as the common evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its showy yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Oxys incarnata is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields, and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties."
