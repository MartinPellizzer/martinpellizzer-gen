    "intro": "Olea europaea var. laurifolia, commonly known as the laurel olive, is a variant of the olive tree characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are broader and more rounded than those of the typical olive. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by edible fruits that are similar to those of the common olive. Its foliage is evergreen, providing year-round ornamental value, and it is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens. The species is also valued for its aromatic leaves, which are used in culinary and medicinal applications."
