    "intro": "Opuntia alpina, commonly known as the Alpine prickly pear, is a cactus native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers, typically in the summer months, which are followed by edible, spherical fruits. Opuntia alpina is adapted to arid and high-altitude environments, with a succulent structure that stores water efficiently. It plays an important role in its ecosystem, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
