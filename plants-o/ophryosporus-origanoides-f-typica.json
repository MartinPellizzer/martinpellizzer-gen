    "intro": "Ophryosporus origanoides f. typica, commonly known as the typical form of the genus Ophryosporus, is a member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in umbels. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and disturbed areas. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and it is often found in temperate regions of the Mediterranean. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
