    "intro": "Oncidium geraense, commonly known as the Geraense orchid, is a tropical orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Oncidium geraense is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
