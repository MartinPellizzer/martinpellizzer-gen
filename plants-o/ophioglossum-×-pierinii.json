    "intro": "Ophioglossum \u00d7 pierinii, commonly known as the hybrid adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spurred spores and a unique leaf structure that resembles a tongue, giving it its common name. The plant produces a single, large, heart-shaped leaf that can reach up to two meters in length. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its sporangia are clustered in a specialized structure called a sorus. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
