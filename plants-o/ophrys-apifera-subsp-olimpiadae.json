    "intro": "Ophrys apifera subsp. olimpiadae, commonly known as the Olympic bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. This subspecies is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a striking blend of yellow and brown hues that closely resemble the bee's body. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation priority in its native range."
