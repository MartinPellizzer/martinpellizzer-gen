    "intro": "Ophiopogon spicatus var. koreanus, commonly known as Korean spiky grass, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are arranged in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground covers."
