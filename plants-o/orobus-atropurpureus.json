    "intro": "Orobus atropurpureus, commonly known as the purple globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, purple-pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves and produces small, round seed pods that split open when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species adapted to arid environments. Orobus atropurpureus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
