It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers in early spring. The plant belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its underground bulbs that store nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
