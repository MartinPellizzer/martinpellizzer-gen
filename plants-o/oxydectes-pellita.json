    "intro": "Oxydectes pellita, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Oxydectes pellita is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh conditions."
