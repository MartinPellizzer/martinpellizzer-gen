    "intro": "Ophrys scolopax var. sepalina, commonly known as the Sepaline Bee Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive lip that resembles the body of a bee, complete with fine hairs and a dark marking. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Due to its specific ecological requirements and habitat fragmentation, this variety is considered endangered in many regions."
