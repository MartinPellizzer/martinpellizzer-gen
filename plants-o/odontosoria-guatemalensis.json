    "intro": "Odontosoria guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan tooth fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a serrated or tooth-like appearance. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new fronds along their length. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are usually located on the underside of the fronds. Odontosoria guatemalensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
