    "intro": "Onobrychis oxyodonta, commonly known as the oxyodonta burr clover, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces spherical, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
