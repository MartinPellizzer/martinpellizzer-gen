    "intro": "Oxytropis setosa var. aigulak, commonly known as the alpine oxytropis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish to brownish flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in dense, globular inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
