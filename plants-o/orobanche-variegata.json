    "intro": "Orobanche variegata, commonly known as the variegated broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to regions of Europe and western Asia. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host plants, such as those in the genus Astragalus. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
