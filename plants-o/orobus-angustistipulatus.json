    "intro": "Orobus angustistipulatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orobus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, also known as the legume or bean family, characterized by its pod-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows in grassland habitats and is known for its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role and potential for use in restoration projects."
