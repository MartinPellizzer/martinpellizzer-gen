    "intro": "Onobrychis gypsicola, commonly known as the gypsum bursfoot, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a sprawling habit, characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. It is adapted to thrive in poor, calcareous soils, often found on rocky or sandy soils. Onobrychis gypsicola is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
