    "intro": "Ophioglossum ekmanii, commonly known as the ekman's adder's mouth, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae, which is characterized by its unique, primitive morphology. The plant has a short, erect rhizome with a single, pinnate leaf that is often covered in a dense layer of hair. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a distinctive, tongue-like shape at the base of the leaf. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophioglossum ekmanii is considered a conservation concern."
