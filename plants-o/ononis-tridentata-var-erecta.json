It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, hairy fruits. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a resilient species in arid environments."
