    "intro": "Ornithogalum tenuifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved star-of-Bethlehem, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in the spring. The plant is adapted to rocky and dry soils, often growing in open woodlands or along stream banks. Its bulbs are toxic and contain calcium oxalate crystals, which can cause irritation if ingested. It is valued in gardens for its elegant appearance and early blooming habit."
