    "intro": "Ochthephilus repentinus, commonly known as the sudden orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, ephemeral blooms that appear suddenly and often last only a short period. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with a unique structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Ochthephilus repentinus is considered a critically endangered plant."
