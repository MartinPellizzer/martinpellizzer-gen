    "intro": "Oberonia ciliolata, commonly known as the feather-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Oberonia ciliolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
