    "intro": "Onobrychis degenii, commonly known as the Degen's vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant produces elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is native to regions of southern Europe and is often found in dry, rocky soils. Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
