    "intro": "Ophrys ferrum-equinum subsp. ferrum-equinum, commonly known as the iron-horse orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a male bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting its specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
