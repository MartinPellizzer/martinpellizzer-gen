It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. It is often found in rocky or calcareous habitats. Sosnowsky's vetch is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
