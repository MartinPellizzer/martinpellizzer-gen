    "intro": "Orchis maculata var. montana, commonly known as the mountain spotted orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, spotted purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and thrives in woodland or meadow habitats. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinator populations."
