    "intro": "Onobrychis brachypus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved burclover, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Onobrychis brachypus is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment."
