    "intro": "Octadesmia oligophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed liverwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a thallus that is leafy and closely resembles a small, flat moss, with a dense arrangement of small, scale-like leaves. Its reproductive structures, including male and female gametophytes, are borne on specialized shoots called caulocarps. Octadesmia oligophylla plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
