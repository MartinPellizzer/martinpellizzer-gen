    "intro": "Opuntia pituitosa, commonly known as the yellow prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy pads called cladodes, which are covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits. Opuntia pituitosa is adapted to arid environments and has a shallow root system to conserve water. It is also valued for its ornamental use and traditional medicinal properties."
