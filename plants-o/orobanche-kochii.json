    "intro": "Orobanche kochii, commonly known as the Indian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and stems, with a taproot that attaches to the roots of its host. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, and it is often found growing on the roots of various leguminous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host, making it a concern in agricultural settings. Its distribution spans across Asia, Africa, and parts of Europe, where it thrives in dry, disturbed habitats."
