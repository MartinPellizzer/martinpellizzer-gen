    "intro": "Odonellia, commonly known as the \"buttercup\" or \"cup-leaved plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that resemble the shape of a cup or a buttercup. The flowers are typically small and white or yellow, arranged in umbels, which is a common feature in the carrot family. Odonellia species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
