    "intro": "Ophiopogon grandis, commonly known as the Japanese forest grass, is a perennial evergreen plant native to East Asia. It features dense, grass-like foliage that forms a low-growing mat, often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in late summer, which are followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Ophiopogon grandis is valued for its ability to suppress weeds and its adaptability to various garden conditions."
