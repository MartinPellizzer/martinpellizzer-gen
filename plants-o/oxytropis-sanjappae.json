It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Oxytropis sanjappae is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its ecological role includes soil stabilization and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitat."
