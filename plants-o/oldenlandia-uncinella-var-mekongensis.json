It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs. This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its unique floral structure and habitat preference. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
