    "intro": "Ornithocephalus minimiflorus, commonly known as the dwarf flower orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its small, pale green leaves and tiny, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with high levels of diffuse light. Its root system is highly specialized, forming symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi to absorb nutrients from poor soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation efforts."
