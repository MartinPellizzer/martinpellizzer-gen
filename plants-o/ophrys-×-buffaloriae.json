    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 buffaloriae, commonly known as the Buffaloria bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like floral structure, which features a prominent, hairy lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, and it thrives in temperate climates. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow and brown, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Ophrys \u00d7 buffaloriae is a short-lived perennial, producing a single spike of flowers each year before dying."
