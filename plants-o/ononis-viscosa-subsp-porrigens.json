    "intro": "Ononis viscosa subsp. porrigens, commonly known as the silky bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and covered with fine, silky hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
