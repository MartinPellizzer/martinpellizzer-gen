    "intro": "Oenothera veitchiana, commonly known as Veitch's evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Oenothera veitchiana is also noted for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
