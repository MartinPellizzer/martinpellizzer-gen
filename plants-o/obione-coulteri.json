    "intro": "Obione coulteri, commonly known as the Coulter's obione, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Obione coulteri thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds."
