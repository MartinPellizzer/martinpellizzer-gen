    "intro": "Ochna parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved ochna, is a deciduous shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Ochna parvifolia is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories."
