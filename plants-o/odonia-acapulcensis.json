    "intro": "Odonia acapulcensis, commonly known as the Acapulco odon, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, composite heads. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Odonia acapulcensis is considered a vulnerable species."
