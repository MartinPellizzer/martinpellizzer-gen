    "intro": "Onoclea hintonii, commonly known as the Hinton's water fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, bioluminescent fronds that emit a soft glow in the dark, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and swampy areas, where it can absorb the necessary humidity for survival. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the fronds. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Onoclea hintonii is considered a vulnerable species, making it a subject of conservation interest."
