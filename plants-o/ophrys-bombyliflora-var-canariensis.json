    "intro": "Ophrys bombyliflora var. canariensis, commonly known as the Canary orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female wasps to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone habitats, thriving in the arid and coastal environments of the islands. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and emit a faint scent that enhances its mimicry. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
