    "intro": "Orchis majalis f. immaculata, commonly known as the white orchid or white lady's tresses, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, white or pale pink floral spikes that bloom in early summer. The plant features long, grass-like leaves and is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are highly fragrant and attract various pollinators, including bees and moths. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this variety is considered endangered in many regions."
