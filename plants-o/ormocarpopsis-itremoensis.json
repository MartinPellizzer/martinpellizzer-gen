    "intro": "Ormocarpopsis itremoensis, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and vivid coloration. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments, where it thrives on nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are often fragrant and attract specific pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
