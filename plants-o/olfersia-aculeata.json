    "intro": "Olfersia aculeata, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, round, brown fruits that contain a single seed, often used in traditional medicine. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions. Olfersia aculeata is also valued for its potential in ecological restoration due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
