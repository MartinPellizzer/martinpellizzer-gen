    "intro": "Orthaea merumensis, commonly known as the coastal orthaea, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Orthaea merumensis plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
