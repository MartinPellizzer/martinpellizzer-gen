    "intro": "Ocotea choquetangensis, commonly known as the Choquetangensis Ocotea, is a tropical evergreen tree belonging to the Lauraceae family. It is native to the humid forests of South America, particularly in regions of Colombia and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the late summer. Its fruit is a drupe, typically containing a single seed, and it plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
