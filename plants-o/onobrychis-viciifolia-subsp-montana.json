    "intro": "Onobrychis viciifolia subsp. montana, commonly known as the mountain vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in well-drained, often rocky soils. It is also notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects. Its growth habit makes it suitable for use in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
