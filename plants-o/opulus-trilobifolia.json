    "intro": "Opulus trilobifolia, commonly known as the three-lobed whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, white flowers that appear in clusters, typically in late spring. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have three distinct lobes, giving the plant its common name. The bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky habitats."
