    "intro": "Oxyceros scandens, commonly known as the climbing oxyceros, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is a woody vine characterized by its slender, twisting stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Oxyceros scandens is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks."
