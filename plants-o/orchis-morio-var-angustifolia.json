    "intro": "Orchis morio var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved early purple orchid, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in woodland or grassland habitats, preferring moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers that can reach up to 30 cm in height. This variety is considered rare and is protected in some regions due to habitat loss and over-collection."
