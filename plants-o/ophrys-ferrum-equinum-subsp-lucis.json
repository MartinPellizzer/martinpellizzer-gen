    "intro": "Ophrys ferrum-equinum subsp. lucis, commonly known as the dawn orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific alpine and rocky habitats. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature known as pseudocopulation, used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a dark brown or black labellum that is highly specialized for its pollination strategy. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils, often in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
