    "intro": "Oenothera linifolia var. typica, commonly known as the silverleaf evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which reflects light and helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry grasslands and rocky habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential health benefits."
