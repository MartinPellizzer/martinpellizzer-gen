    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia var. gracillima, commonly known as the slender common twayblade, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It is a mycoheterotroph, meaning it relies on fungal associations for nutrients rather than photosynthesis. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes."
