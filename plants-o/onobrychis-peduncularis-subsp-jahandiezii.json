    "intro": "Onobrychis peduncularis subsp. jahandiezii, commonly known as Persian clover, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and compact, globular flower heads that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. It has a deep root system that allows it to access moisture from deeper soil layers, making it drought-tolerant. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
