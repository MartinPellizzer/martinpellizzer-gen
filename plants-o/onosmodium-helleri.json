    "intro": "Onosmodium helleri, commonly known as the Heller's onosmodium, is a rare and striking member of the Acanthaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. The plant is characterized by its striking, velvety purple foliage and clusters of small, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of violet and blue. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in specialty gardens and greenhouses. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in the wild, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
