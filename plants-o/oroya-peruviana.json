    "intro": "Oroya peruviana, commonly known as the Andean morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, orange-colored capsule that splits open when mature. Oroya peruviana is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
