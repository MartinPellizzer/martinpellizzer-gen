    "intro": "Ochrosia balansae var. excelsior, commonly known as the highland ochrosia, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and arranged in whorls around the stems. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
