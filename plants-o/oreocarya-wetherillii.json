    "intro": "Oreocarya wetherillii, commonly known as the Wetherill's oreocarya, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the high-elevation regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and small, glandular leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, arid conditions. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Oreocarya wetherillii thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
