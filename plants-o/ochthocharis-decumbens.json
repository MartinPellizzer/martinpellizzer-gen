    "intro": "Ochthocharis decumbens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Ochthocharis decumbens thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
