    "intro": "Orchis polliniana, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive flower spikes that resemble bees, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with a lip that mimics the appearance of an insect. Orchis polliniana is a herbaceous perennial that produces showy, fragrant blooms from late spring to early summer."
