    "intro": "Otiophora scabra var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its smooth, glabrous leaves distinguish it from the more hairy form of the species. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
