    "intro": "Orchis morio f. variegata, commonly known as the variegated early purple orchid, is a striking orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive purple and white variegated flowers, which bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in association with other orchid species. Its leaves are lance-shaped and form a basal rosette, while the stem is usually unbranched. This orchid is a perennial herb that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for its growth and reproduction."
