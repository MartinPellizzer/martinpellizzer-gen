    "intro": "Orobanche cannabios, commonly known as the cannabis broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is often found parasitizing species within the Cannabaceae family, including Cannabis sativa. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or greenish in color. Its life cycle involves germination in response to chemical signals released by host roots. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
