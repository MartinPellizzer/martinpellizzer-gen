    "intro": "Orobanche crenata var. owerinii, commonly known as the dwarf broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing members of the Fabaceae family. The plant is characterized by its yellowish or reddish stems and small, scale-like leaves. It is native to parts of Africa and is often found in dry, disturbed habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants."
