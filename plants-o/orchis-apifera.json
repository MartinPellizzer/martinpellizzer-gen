    "intro": "Orchis apifera, commonly known as the honey orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear a single spike of showy, violet to purple flowers. Its flowers have a distinctive honey-like scent, which attracts pollinators such as bees and wasps. Orchis apifera is known for its intricate floral structure, with three sepals and three petals, one of which is often modified into a lip."
