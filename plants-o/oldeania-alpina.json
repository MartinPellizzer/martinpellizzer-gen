    "intro": "Oldeania alpina, commonly known as the Alpine Olive, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Canary Islands. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Oldeania alpina produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
