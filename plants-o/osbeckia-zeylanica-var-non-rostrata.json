    "intro": "Osbeckia zeylanica var. non-rostrata, commonly known as the narrow-beaked osbeckia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The flowers are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. This variant is distinguished by its reduced or absent beak-like structure at the tip of the fruit, which sets it apart from other varieties of Osbeckia. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and coastal areas."
