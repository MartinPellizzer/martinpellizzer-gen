    "intro": "Oreocereus variicolor, commonly known as the variable crown-of-thorns, is a member of the Cactaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and produces yellow or orange flowers during the dry season. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping."
