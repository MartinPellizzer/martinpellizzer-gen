    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 redliorum, commonly known as the red-listed orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is characterized by its complex, bee-mimicking flowers that feature intricate patterns and a prominent lip resembling a female bee. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils in woodland and grassland habitats across Europe. It is a perennial herb with a short, erect stem bearing a single, showy flower. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in several countries."
