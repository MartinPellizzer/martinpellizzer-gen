    "intro": "Orobanche uniflora subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as the western common broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is found in various regions of western North America, often growing in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces a single, showy, yellowish or orange flower per stem, which is typical of its genus. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, known for its parasitic and hemiparasitic species. Due to its lack of leaves and photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions with its host plants."
