    "intro": "Olea europaea var. bifera, commonly known as the bifera olive, is a rare variant of the common olive tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique bifid (split) leaves, which are narrower and more elongated compared to typical olive leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by the development of small, greenish-black fruits. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its distinctive foliage and historical significance in horticulture. This variety is also valued for its potential in olive oil production, though it is less common than the standard olive tree."
