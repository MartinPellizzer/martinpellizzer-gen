    "intro": "Orobanche alba subsp. xanthostigma, commonly known as the white broom weed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish to white flowers with a distinctive yellow stripe. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in regions with temperate climates. It has a short, branched stem and small, scale-like leaves. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants, particularly those in the legume family."
