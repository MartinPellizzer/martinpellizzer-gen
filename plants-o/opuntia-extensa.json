    "intro": "Opuntia extensa, commonly known as the giant prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its large, flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are tiny, barbed bristles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fruit that is typically red or yellow and contains edible seeds. Opuntia extensa is a xerophyte, adapted to arid environments with succulent stems that store water. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
