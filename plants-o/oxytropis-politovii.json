    "intro": "Oxytropis politovii, commonly known as the Poltovskii locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the steppes of Central Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pea-like flowers. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
