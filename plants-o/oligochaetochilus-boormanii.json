    "intro": "Oligochaetochilus boormanii, commonly known as the Boorman's moss orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. Its leaves are usually small and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in its humid, shaded habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
