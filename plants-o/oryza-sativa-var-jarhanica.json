    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. jarhanica, commonly known as the Jarhan rice, is a rare and ancient variety of rice native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its small, aromatic grains and is typically grown in lowland wet rice fields. The plant has a short stature, with erect leaves and panicles that produce a profuse number of small, white flowers. It is adapted to tropical climates and requires a warm, humid environment for optimal growth. Due to its unique genetic makeup, it is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers for its potential in breeding programs."
