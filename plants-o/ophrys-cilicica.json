    "intro": "Ophrys cilicica, commonly known as the Cilician Orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in Turkey. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which features a specialized lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, aiding in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils, often in mountainous regions. Its flowers are usually pale green to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ophrys cilicica is considered a vulnerable species."
