It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture, and its flowers are small and clustered. Oreocarya hispida is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous regions of Nevada, California, and Oregon."
