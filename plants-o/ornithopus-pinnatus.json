    "intro": "Ornithopus pinnatus, commonly known as the slender bird's-foot trefoil, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its scientific name reflects its bird-like appearance, with the \"pinnatus\" referring to its feather-like leaf structure. Ornithopus pinnatus is also valued for its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
