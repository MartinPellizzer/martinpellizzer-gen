The plant has a trailing growth habit and produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Onix galegiformis is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
