    "intro": "Oberonia langbianensis, commonly known as the Langbian orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the mountainous regions of Vietnam. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pendulous inflorescences bearing small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers exhibit a range of colors, from white to pale pink, and are often adorned with intricate patterns. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Oberonia langbianensis is considered a threatened species requiring conservation efforts."
