    "intro": "Odontites puigii, commonly known as the Canary Islands rockfoil, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Canary Islands. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant features basal leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in dense inflorescences, and are typically white or pale blue in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Odontites puigii is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
