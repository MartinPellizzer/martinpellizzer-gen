    "intro": "Odontocarya tenacissima, commonly known as the hardy rock cress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, adapting to harsh alpine conditions. Odontocarya tenacissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor, rocky soils."
