    "intro": "Orobanche minor var. compositarum, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its distinctive, often yellowish or reddish, floral structures. The plant typically grows in association with various herbaceous plants, particularly those in the legume family. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for several years, facilitating its persistence in suitable habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants."
