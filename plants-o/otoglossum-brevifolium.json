    "intro": "Otoglossum brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaved orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
