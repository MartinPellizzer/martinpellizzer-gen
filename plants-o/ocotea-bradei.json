    "intro": "Ocotea bradei, commonly known as the Brade's ocotea, is a species of flowering plant in the Lauraceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America, particularly in regions of Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically elliptical and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, fragrant flowers are clustered in inflorescences, and it produces dark, glossy berries that are edible for some bird species. Ocotea bradei is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional crafts and as a source of essential oils."
