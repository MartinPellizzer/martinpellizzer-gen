    "intro": "Ocotea imrayana, commonly known as the white sand ocotea, is a species of flowering plant in the Lauraceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically elliptical and glossy, and its fragrant, small white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that turns from green to yellow or red when mature. Ocotea imrayana is valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
