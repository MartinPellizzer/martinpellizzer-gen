It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which provides a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by spiky, bristly seed heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry grasslands and rocky areas. Its botanical features make it a notable species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
