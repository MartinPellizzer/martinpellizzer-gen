    "intro": "Oligochaetochilus ziegeleri, commonly known as the Ziegeler's mossy orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate, moss-like foliage that helps it thrive in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with faintly colored lips, adapted for specific pollinators. It is often found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks, where it forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
