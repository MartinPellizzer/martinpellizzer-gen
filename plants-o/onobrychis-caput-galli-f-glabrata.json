    "intro": "Onobrychis caput-galli f. glabrata, commonly known as the glabrous head vetch, is a variant of the common head vetch. It is a perennial legume characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its root system is well-developed, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. This form is notable for its reduced pubescence, giving it a smoother appearance compared to the typical variety."
