    "intro": "Orobanche montserratii, commonly known as the Spanish broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the Iberian Peninsula, particularly in regions like Spain and Portugal. The plant produces small, yellowish or greenish flowers that are often overlooked due to its inconspicuous appearance. It typically parasitizes species of the genus Astragalus, which are common in Mediterranean shrublands. Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a unique role in its ecological niche, though it is not considered invasive in its native range."
