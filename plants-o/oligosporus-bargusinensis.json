It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brownish florets. Its leaves are narrow and\u575a\u97e7, adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
