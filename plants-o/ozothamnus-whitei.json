    "intro": "Ozothamnus whitei, commonly known as White's golden bush, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It features narrow, aromatic leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring and attract various pollinators. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Ozothamnus whitei is often used in native landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
