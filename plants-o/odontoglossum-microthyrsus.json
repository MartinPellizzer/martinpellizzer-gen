    "intro": "Odontoglossum microthyrsus, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact growth habit, featuring a pseudobulb and fleshy roots that help it survive in its humid, shaded habitat. The plant produces small, intricate flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often arranged in a raceme. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, typically clustered at the base of the pseudobulb. Odontoglossum microthyrsus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
