    "intro": "Oxytropis rubriargillosa, commonly known as the red-stemmed locoweed, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, hairy stems, and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
