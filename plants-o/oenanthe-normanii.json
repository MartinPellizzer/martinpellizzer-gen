    "intro": "Oenanthe normanii, commonly known as the Norman's hemlock, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oenanthe normanii is considered a rare and endangered species."
