    "intro": "Oosterdyckia lenormandii, commonly known as the Lenormand's marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in specific wetland habitats. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has a short, underground rhizome and produces a single, tall flowering stem with several whorls of leaves. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
