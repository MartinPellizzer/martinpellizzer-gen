    "intro": "Ophrys aranifera subsp. pseudospeculum, commonly known as the mimic bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flowers that have evolved to mimic the appearance of female bees to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and open woodlands. Its flowers are rich in nectar and emit a subtle scent that enhances the mimicry. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
