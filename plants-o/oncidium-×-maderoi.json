    "intro": "Oncidium \u00d7 maderoi, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which resemble butterflies, and its upright, branching growth habit. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in tropical and subtropical climates. Oncidium \u00d7 maderoi thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its popularity as a decorative plant is due to its long-lasting blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
