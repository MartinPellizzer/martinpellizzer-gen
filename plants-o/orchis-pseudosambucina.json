    "intro": "Orchis pseudosambucina, commonly known as the false elder orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is characterized by its tall, upright stems and clusters of pale purple to pinkish flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its pollination is primarily facilitated by bees and other insect pollinators. The species is considered rare and is often protected in its natural habitats due to habitat loss and over-collection."
