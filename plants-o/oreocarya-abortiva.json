    "intro": "Oreocarya abortiva, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapting to harsh desert conditions. The plant features a rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Oreocarya abortiva is also known for its ability to survive in low-water environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
