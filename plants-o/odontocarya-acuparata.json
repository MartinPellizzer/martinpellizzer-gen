    "intro": "Odontocarya acuparata, commonly known as the needleleaf odontocarya, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific high-altitude regions. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed, providing a unique adaptation to its harsh environment. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish in color, which bloom in the early spring. Its roots are fibrous and help it anchor in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
