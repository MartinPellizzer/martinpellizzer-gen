    "intro": "Oncidium ciliicolumna, commonly known as the columned orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features long, slender pseudobulbs that support its evergreen foliage, which consists of strap-like leaves. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or green with red or brown markings. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Oncidium ciliicolumna is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
