    "intro": "Ormocarpum trachycarpum, commonly known as the rough-seeded ormocarp, is a flowering plant species native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces distinctive, woody fruits that are covered in a rough, hairy texture, giving it its scientific name. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
