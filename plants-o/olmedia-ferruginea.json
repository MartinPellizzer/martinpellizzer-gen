    "intro": "Olmedia ferruginea, commonly known as the ironwood tree, is a species native to the Canary Islands. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with a dense, rugged trunk and a broad, rounded crown. The leaves are leathery, dark green, and have a distinctive iron-gray underside, giving the plant its common name. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by round, black fruits that are edible but not widely cultivated. The tree is valued for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soils, making it an important species in island ecosystems."
