    "intro": "Orobus sessilifolius, commonly known as the sessile-leaved orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, greenish-white or pale yellow blooms during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk, and are usually narrow and grass-like in appearance. Orobus sessilifolius thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats."
