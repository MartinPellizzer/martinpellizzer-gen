    "intro": "Orchis elata f. peltieri, commonly known as the Peltate Orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, which helps in water retention. This orchid thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
