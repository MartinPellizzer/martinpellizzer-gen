It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has compound leaves with several oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Ononis foetida is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is most noticeable when the fruits are mature."
