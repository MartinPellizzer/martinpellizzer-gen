    "intro": "Ottelia stratiotes, commonly known as water buttercup, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom above the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Ottelia stratiotes plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and stabilizing water surfaces."
