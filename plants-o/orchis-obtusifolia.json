    "intro": "Orchis obtusifolia, commonly known as the blunt-leaved orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hair. The plant produces a tall flowering stem that bears a single, showy violet or purple flower with a distinctive pouch-like structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Orchis obtusifolia is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
