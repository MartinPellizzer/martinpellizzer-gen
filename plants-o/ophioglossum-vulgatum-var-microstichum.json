    "intro": "Ophioglossum vulgatum var. microstichum, commonly known as the small-stemmed adder's-tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species with a unique botanical structure. It features a short, horizontal rhizome that produces a single, lance-shaped leaf with a distinctive, tongue-like spore-producing structure on its underside. The leaf is typically narrow and elongated, with a thick, waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its woodland habitat. Its spores are borne in clusters on the underside of the leaf, a characteristic feature of the Ophioglossaceae family. This plant is often found in moist, shaded areas and is considered a relict species with a long evolutionary history."
