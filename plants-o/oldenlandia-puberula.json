    "intro": "Oldenlandia puberula, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silky ironweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, often pubescent stems and leaves, which give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Oldenlandia puberula is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
