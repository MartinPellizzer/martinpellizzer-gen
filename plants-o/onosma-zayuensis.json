It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows. It is adapted to cold climates and has a short growing season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
