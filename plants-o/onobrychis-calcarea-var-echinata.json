    "intro": "Onobrychis calcarea var. echinata, commonly known as the thorny vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces pods that are typically hairy and contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
