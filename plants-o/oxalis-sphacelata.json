    "intro": "Oxalis sphacelata, commonly known as the coral root oxalis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that resemble those of the common wood sorrel. The plant produces small, pale pink or white flowers with five petals, often clustered in racemes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Oxalis sphacelata is known for its ability to form dense mats, which can help suppress weeds and stabilize soil."
