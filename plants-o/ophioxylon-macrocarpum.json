    "intro": "Ophioxylon macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-fruited oxyleon, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, elliptical leaves with a smooth surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by distinctive, large, fleshy fruits that are typically reddish in color. Ophioxylon macrocarpum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
