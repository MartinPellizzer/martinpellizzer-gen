    "intro": "Opuntia erinacea var. columbiana, commonly known as the Columbian prickly pear, is a cacti species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features flattened, fleshy stems that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted for water storage in arid environments. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and often used in local cuisines. The plant is characterized by its spiny areoles and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
