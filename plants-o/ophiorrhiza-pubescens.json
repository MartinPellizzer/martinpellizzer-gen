    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza pubescens, commonly known as the hairy swamp banyan, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine pubescence, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing single seeds. It thrives in wet, swampy environments and is often found in mangrove ecosystems. Ophiorrhiza pubescens plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local biodiversity."
