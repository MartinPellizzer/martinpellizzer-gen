    "intro": "Oncidium nodosum, commonly known as the nodding orchid, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically blooms in the summer months, producing showy, drooping inflorescences that attract pollinators. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor. Oncidium nodosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
