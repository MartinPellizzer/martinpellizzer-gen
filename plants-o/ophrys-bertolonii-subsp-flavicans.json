    "intro": "Ophrys bertolonii subsp. flavicans, commonly known as the yellow bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow and brown flowers that resemble a bee, a feature that aids in pollination by mimicking the appearance and scent of its pollinators. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It has a slender, erect stem with a single or few flowers at the top. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is known for its specialized pollination mechanism involving male bees."
