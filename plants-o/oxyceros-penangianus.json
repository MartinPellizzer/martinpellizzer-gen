    "intro": "Oxyceros penangianus, commonly known as Penang tree or Penang ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Singapore. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, fissured bark. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
