It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, showy flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in rocky or dry environments. Its leaves are usually linear and grass-like, adapting to its arid habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil."
