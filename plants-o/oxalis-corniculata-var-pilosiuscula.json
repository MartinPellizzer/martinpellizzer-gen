    "intro": "Oxalis corniculata var. pilosiuscula, commonly known as the hairy wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to Asia and parts of Africa. It is a small, herbaceous perennial with trifoliate leaves that have a distinctive heart-shaped appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in gardens and along forest edges. Its foliage and flowers are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though it contains oxalic acid and should be handled with care."
