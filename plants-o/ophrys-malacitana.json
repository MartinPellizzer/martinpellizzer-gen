    "intro": "Ophrys malacitana, commonly known as the Malacitan bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its striking floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy. Ophrys malacitana is a rare and protected species, often found in specific microhabitats within its native range."
