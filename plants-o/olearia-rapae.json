    "intro": "Olearia rapae, commonly known as the New Zealand frostflower, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to harsh, windy conditions. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Olearia rapae is an important component of New Zealand's native flora and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky shores."
