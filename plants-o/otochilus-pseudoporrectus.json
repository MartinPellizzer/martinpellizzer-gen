    "intro": "Otochilus pseudoporrectus, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is native to New Zealand. It is a large, evergreen fern that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forests. Its fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
