    "intro": "Oreocereus ritteri, commonly known as the Ritter's moon cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico. It is a small, slow-growing cactus characterized by its globular shape and vibrant, colorful flowers that bloom in spring. The plant features a thick, fleshy stem covered in spines, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and are produced at the top of the plant, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. Oreocereus ritteri is well-suited for cultivation in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts."
