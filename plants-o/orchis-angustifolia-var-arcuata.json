    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia var. arcuata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a rare and delicate species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and a single spike of pale purple to white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, this orchid is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
