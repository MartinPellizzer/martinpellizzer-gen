It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and tall spikes of violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. It is a perennial herb that produces both showy flowers and smaller, less conspicuous ones for self-pollination. The species is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role and ornamental value."
