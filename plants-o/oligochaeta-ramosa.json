It is characterized by its thalloid structure, which is typically dorsiventral and lobed, with a distinct upper and lower surface. The plant produces male and female gametophores, which are specialized structures for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil surfaces. Oligochaeta ramosa plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms."
