    "intro": "Ondinea purpurea subsp. petaloidea, commonly known as the purple sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cystolithaceae. It is characterized by its striking purple flowers and fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its coastal habitat. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shorelines of the western Atlantic. Its flowers are often surrounded by a ring of modified leaves called perianths, which enhance its ornamental appeal. It is well adapted to saline environments and can tolerate periodic flooding."
