    "intro": "Orobanche condensata, commonly known as the clustered broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing on species of Astragalus and other legumes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short, thick stem with few leaves. Its life cycle is closely tied to the germination of its host, and it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops. Due to its specialized parasitic nature, it is considered a weed in many areas where it invades cultivated fields."
