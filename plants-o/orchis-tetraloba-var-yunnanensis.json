    "intro": "Orchis tetraloba var. yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan broad-leaved orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to China. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and striking, violet-blue flowers with a yellow lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats, often in mountainous regions. Its floral structure is typical of the Orchidaceae family, featuring three sepals and three petals, with the lip being highly modified. This variety is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
