    "intro": "Opuntia denudata, commonly known as the naked prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, paddle-shaped stems, which are covered in spines and are adapted for water storage. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia denudata is a shrub-like plant that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its structure and growth habits make it well-suited for desert ecosystems."
