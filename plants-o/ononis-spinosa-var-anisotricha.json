    "intro": "Ononis spinosa var. anisotricha, commonly known as the hairy bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branching stems covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, often with a serrated edge. This variety is often found in grassy areas, along pathways, and in disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
