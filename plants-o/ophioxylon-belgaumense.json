    "intro": "Ophioxylon belgaumense, commonly known as the Belgaum wood, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its woody stem and unique foliage, which are adapted to the humid and tropical climate of its habitat. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and has a distinctive bark that is often covered in a layer of moss. It plays a vital role in the local ecosystem by providing shelter and food for various insects and small animals. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern."
