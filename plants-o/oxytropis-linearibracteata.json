It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe, often growing in well-drained soils."
