    "intro": "Oncidium hastatum, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, strap-like leaves and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that resemble butterflies. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it prefers bright, indirect light with high humidity. Oncidium hastatum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
