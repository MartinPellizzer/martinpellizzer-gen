    "intro": "Ornithogalum gracile, commonly known as the slender star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers during the spring and summer months. The plant belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its bulbous underground storage structures. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated in gardens across temperate regions."
