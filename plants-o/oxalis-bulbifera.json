    "intro": "Oxalis bulbifera, commonly known as the bulbous wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet bearing a distinctive heart-shaped base. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. Its unique feature is the production of bulb-like structures called bulbils, which develop at the base of the leaves and can propagate the plant. Oxalis bulbifera thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade."
