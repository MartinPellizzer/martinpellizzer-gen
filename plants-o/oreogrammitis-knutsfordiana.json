    "intro": "Oreogrammitis knutsfordiana, commonly known as Knutsford's spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the British Isles. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. The plant features a creeping rhizome with erect, needle-like leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the leaves. Oreogrammitis knutsfordiana is a rare and protected species, reflecting its limited distribution and ecological significance."
