    "intro": "Ophrys dyris, commonly known as the Greek bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance and scent of female bees to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, often in open woodlands or grasslands. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange with dark markings, and the plant produces small, greenish-brown fruits that contain the seeds. Ophrys dyris is a perennial herb that thrives in temperate climates and is known for its unique evolutionary adaptation to mimicry in pollination."
