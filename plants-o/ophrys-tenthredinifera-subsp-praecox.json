    "intro": "Ophrys tenthredinifera subsp. praecox, commonly known as the early bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as grasslands and heathlands, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowering period occurs earlier than most other orchid species, usually in late spring. The subspecies praecox is distinguished by its slightly earlier blooming time and smaller floral size compared to the typical form of Ophrys tenthredinifera."
