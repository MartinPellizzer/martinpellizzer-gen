    "intro": "Oncidium galeatum, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features striking, showy flowers that are typically yellow with green markings, resembling the wings of a butterfly. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its roots are fibrous and often grow in a loose, tangled mass. Oncidium galeatum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
