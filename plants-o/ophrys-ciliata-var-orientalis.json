    "intro": "Ophrys ciliata var. orientalis, commonly known as the Eastern Hairy Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a hairy, bee-mimicking labellum that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, mineral-rich soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
