    "intro": "Ophrys flammeola, commonly known as the flame orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like appearance, with a yellow and orange flower that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are highly specialized, featuring intricate markings and a distinct lip that aids in the pollination process. Ophrys flammeola is a rare and protected species, often found in specific microhabitats across southern Europe."
