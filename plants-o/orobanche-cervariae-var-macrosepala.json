    "intro": "Orobanche cervariae var. macrosepala, commonly known as the giant broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its swollen, fleshy stems and showy, often purple or red flowers. The plant typically parasitizes members of the legume family, such as vetches and clovers, by attaching to their roots with specialized structures called haustoria. Its flowers are usually arranged in dense clusters and can be quite large, giving it its common name. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
