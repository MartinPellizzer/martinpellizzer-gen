    "intro": "Osmunda rupestris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along stream banks and in rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Osmunda rupestris plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
