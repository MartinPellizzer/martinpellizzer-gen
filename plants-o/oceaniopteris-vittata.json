    "intro": "Oceaniopteris vittata, commonly known as the golden feather fern, is a species of fern native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green with a subtle golden hue along the veins. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments near the ocean, where it can access the moisture-rich air and nutrient-laden soil. Its spores are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas along rocky shores and sandy beaches. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and are valued for their ornamental appearance in horticulture."
