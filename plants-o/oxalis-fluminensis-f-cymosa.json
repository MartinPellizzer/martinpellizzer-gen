It features thick, fleshy leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, often in clusters, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant foliage and delicate floral display."
