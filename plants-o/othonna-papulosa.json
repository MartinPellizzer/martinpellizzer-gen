    "intro": "Othonna papulosa, commonly known as the Woolly Othonna, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, contributing to its unique visual character. Othonna papulosa is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
