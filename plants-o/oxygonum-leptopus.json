    "intro": "Oxygonum leptopus, commonly known as the slender waterwheel plant, is a floating aquatic plant native to the Americas. It has long, thin leaves that are typically arranged in a whorl around its stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface, often in clusters. Its roots are adapted to anchor it in shallow water, and it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems. Oxygonum leptopus is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes."
