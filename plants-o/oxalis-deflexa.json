    "intro": "Oxalis deflexa, commonly known as the bent-stem wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets, often adorned with reddish veins. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and early spring blooms."
