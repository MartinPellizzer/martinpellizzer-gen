    "intro": "Oberonia papuana, commonly known as the Papuan Oberonia, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the rainforests of Papua, Indonesia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and features small, dark green leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with a complex structure typical of orchids, featuring a showy lip. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in the understorey of primary forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oberonia papuana is considered a vulnerable species."
