    "intro": "Oligactis hallii, commonly known as the Hall's oligactis, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in high-altitude environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Oligactis hallii is notable for its small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
