    "intro": "Ononis fasciculata, commonly known as creeping sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It has small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features slender, branching stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland deserts."
