    "intro": "[WRONG START] Ornu americana, commonly known as the American hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, oval-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, red-brown fruits that are a food source for wildlife. Ornus americana is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is relatively disease-resistant."
