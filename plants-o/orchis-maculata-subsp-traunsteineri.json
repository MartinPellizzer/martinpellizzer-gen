    "intro": "Orchis maculata subsp. traunsteineri, commonly known as the Traunsteiner's spotted orchid, is a rare and distinctive member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its striking purple and white flowers with prominent yellow markings, which aid in attracting specific pollinators. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland habitats, often in shaded areas. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces a single flower spike with several blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
