    "intro": "Oxygonium elegans, commonly known as the water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features broad, waxy, light green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern on the water's surface. The plant has small, inconspicuous white flowers that emerge above the water, followed by fluffy, seed-producing capsules. Its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water, and it often forms dense mats on the surface of ponds and slow-moving rivers. Oxygonium elegans is known for its ability to provide habitat for aquatic life but can become invasive in non-native environments."
