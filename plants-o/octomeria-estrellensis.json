    "intro": "Octomeria estrellensis, commonly known as the Estrellan octomeria, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typically aromatic foliage. The plant is distinguished by its compact growth habit and showy, yellow-orange inflorescences that bloom in late spring. Octomeria estrellensis thrives in well-drained soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
