    "intro": "Ochropteris peltigera, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, and often golden-colored fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries such as India, China, and Indonesia. Ochropteris peltigera prefers humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
