It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which resemble those of clover, and its clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in woodland areas and thrives in partial shade. It produces small, rounded fruits that contain several seeds. Oxalis lupulina is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to spread through rhizomes."
