    "intro": "Ochronelis sulfurea, commonly known as the sulfur tamarisk, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, saline soils, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually small and scale-like, reducing water loss through transpiration. Ochronelis sulfurea plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
