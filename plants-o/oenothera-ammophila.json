    "intro": "Oenothera ammophila, commonly known as the beach evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of North America. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal bluffs. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a deep root system that helps stabilize dune environments. Oenothera ammophila is an important component of coastal ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various insect species."
