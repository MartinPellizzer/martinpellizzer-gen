    "intro": "Ormocarpum verrucosum var. wombaliense, commonly known as the Wombali sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the sandy soils of northern Australia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically short-lived. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, adapting to the arid environments it inhabits. The fruit is a dry, two-lobed structure that disperses seeds by wind, aiding in its survival in open, sandy habitats."
