    "intro": "Oxalis cernua, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Botanically, it is characterized by its delicate appearance and its ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions."
