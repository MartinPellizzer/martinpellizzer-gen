It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has slender, branched stems and hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
