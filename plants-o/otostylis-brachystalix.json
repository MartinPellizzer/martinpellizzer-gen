    "intro": "Otostylis brachystalix, commonly known as the narrow-leafed spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features a tall, sparsely branched stem with small, narrow leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. Its inflorescence consists of dense spikes of tiny, three-lobed flowers that are wind-pollinated. Otostylis brachystalix plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
