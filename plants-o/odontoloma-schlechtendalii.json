    "intro": "Odontoloma schlechtendalii, commonly known as the Schlechtendal's toothed bellflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of southern Africa. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family, characterized by its bell-shaped flowers. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
