It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which resemble those of clover, and its clusters of small, delicate yellow flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer to early autumn, hence its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Oxalis autumnalis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms."
