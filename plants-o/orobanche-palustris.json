    "intro": "Orobanche palustris, commonly known as the marsh broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It attaches itself to the roots of host plants, primarily grasses, to extract nutrients and water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. It is often found in wet or damp habitats such as marshes and meadows. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem by influencing the growth and distribution of its host plants."
