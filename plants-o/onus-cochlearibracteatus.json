    "intro": "Onus cochlearibracteatus, commonly known as the spiral leaf orchid, is a unique orchid species native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from white to pale pink. Botanically, it is notable for its specialized root system and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
