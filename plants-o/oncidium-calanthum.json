    "intro": "Oncidium calanthum, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow with green or brown markings, resembling the wings of a butterfly. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its roots are epiphytic, allowing it to grow on trees in its natural habitat. Oncidium calanthum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
