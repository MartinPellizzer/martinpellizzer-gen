    "intro": "Oenothera fruticosa f. sessilicarpa, commonly known as the sessile-fruited evening primrose, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems, lance-shaped leaves, and showy yellow flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant produces capsule fruits that are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
