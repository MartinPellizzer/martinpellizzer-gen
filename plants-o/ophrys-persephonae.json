    "intro": "Ophrys persephonae, commonly known as the Greek orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Greece and Turkey. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, upright stem that bears a single, showy floral spike. The flower has a distinctive structure with a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodland or rocky habitats."
