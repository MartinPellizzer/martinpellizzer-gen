It is a low-growing perennial with slender stems and small, opposite leaves that are rounded in shape. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its flowering period makes it a valuable addition to wildflower gardens and ecological restoration projects."
