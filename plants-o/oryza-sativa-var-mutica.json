It is characterized by its slender, elongated grains and typically grows in wetland habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is closely related to domesticated rice and is considered an important wild relative for genetic diversity. Its botanical features make it valuable for both ecological studies and agricultural research."
