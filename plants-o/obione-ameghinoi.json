It belongs to the Alstroemeriaceae family and is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Obione ameghinoi is considered a vulnerable species."
