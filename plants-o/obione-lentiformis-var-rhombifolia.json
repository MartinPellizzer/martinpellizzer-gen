    "intro": "Obione lentiformis var. rhombifolia, commonly known as the rhomboid obione, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its rhombus-shaped leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
