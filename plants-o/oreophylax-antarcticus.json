    "intro": "Oreophylax antarcticus, commonly known as the Antarctic hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the extreme environments of Antarctica. It is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in the harsh, cold conditions of the continent's coastal regions. The plant has a dense, mat-like growth form, which helps it survive the strong winds and low temperatures. Its leaves are short and covered in fine hairs, providing insulation against the cold. Oreophylax antarcticus plays a vital role in stabilizing the fragile soil of Antarctic ecosystems."
