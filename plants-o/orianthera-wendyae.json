    "intro": "Orianthera wendyae, commonly known as Wendy's orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its vibrant, showy blooms that range in color from deep red to orange. The plant features a slender, erect stem with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. Its flowers are borne in clusters and are known for their intricate, lip-like structure that aids in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Orianthera wendyae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
