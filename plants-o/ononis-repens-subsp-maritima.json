    "intro": "Ononis repens subsp. maritima, commonly known as coastal sandspur, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North Africa. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh maritime conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. The plant has small, pale green leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer. Its fibrous roots help stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. It is an important component of coastal vegetation, supporting a variety of insects and birds."
