    "intro": "Oxalis acutifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaf wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to regions of North America, particularly the southwestern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers resembling those of the true sorrel species. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Oxalis acutifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate drought conditions."
