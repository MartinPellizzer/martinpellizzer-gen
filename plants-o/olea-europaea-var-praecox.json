    "intro": "Olea europaea var. praecox, commonly known as early olive, is a variant of the common olive tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its smaller, more compact size compared to the standard olive tree, making it suitable for smaller gardens or containers. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by olive fruits that ripen earlier than those of the typical olive variety. Its leaves are typically smaller and more lance-shaped, with a slightly serrated margin. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
