    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. aurica, commonly known as the golden rice variety, is a type of cultivated rice that has been selectively bred for its unique characteristics. This variety is notable for its golden hue, which comes from the high concentration of beta-carotene in its grains. The botanical features include elongated, slender grains that are typically smaller than those of standard rice varieties. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, requiring warm temperatures and ample water for optimal growth. The plant has a short growth cycle, making it suitable for multiple harvests in a single growing season."
