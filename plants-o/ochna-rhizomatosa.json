    "intro": "Ochna rhizomatosa, commonly known as the African velvetleaf, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in agricultural areas. Ochna rhizomatosa is also noted for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and climatic conditions."
