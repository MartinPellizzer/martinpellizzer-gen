    "intro": "Ozothamnus filifolius, commonly known as silverleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with silvery-gray foliage that reflects light, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seed heads similar to those of dandelions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sandy environments. Ozothamnus filifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native gardens."
