    "intro": "Ossaea bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate ossaea, is a flowering plant species native to the southern regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Restionaceae, which includes many grass-like plants adapted to arid and coastal environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and small, clustered flowers that are often concealed within leaf-like bracts. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is typically found in coastal dunes or inland grasslands. Ossaea bracteata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local invertebrates."
