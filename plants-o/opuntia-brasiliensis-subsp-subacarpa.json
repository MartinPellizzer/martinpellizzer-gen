    "intro": "Opuntia brasiliensis subsp. subacarpa, commonly known as the Brazilian prickly pear, is a cactus species native to Brazil. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy pads, known as cladodes, which are covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer, followed by edible, red fruits. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It plays an important role in local ecosystems and has traditional uses in indigenous cultures."
