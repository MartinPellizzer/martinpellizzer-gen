    "intro": "Oberonia cavaleriei, commonly known as the Cavalerie's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, often pendulous flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread slowly over time. Its leaves are usually broad and elliptical, providing a lush green backdrop to its showy blooms. Oberonia cavaleriei thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary forest understories."
