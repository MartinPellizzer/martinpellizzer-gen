    "intro": "Ononis natrix subsp. natrix, commonly known as the slender bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features wiry stems covered in fine, silky hairs and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has alternate, narrow, and often hairy leaves that are usually less than 5 cm in length. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies and habitat conservation."
