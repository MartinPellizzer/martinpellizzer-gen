    "intro": "Orchis speciosa var. alba, commonly known as the white showy orchis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 feet in height. The plant produces striking white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in a loose spike. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, and it typically thrives in moist, shaded woodlands. This variety is distinguished by its predominantly white coloration, setting it apart from the more commonly seen purple or pink forms of the species."
