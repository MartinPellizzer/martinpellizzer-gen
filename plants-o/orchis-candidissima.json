    "intro": "Orchis candidissima, commonly known as the white helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its pale green to white flowers, which are typically arranged in a loose spike and have a distinctive three-lobed lip. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows, often in temperate regions of Europe and Asia. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arise from a short rhizome, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Orchis candidissima is notable for its role in supporting pollinators and its ecological importance in woodland ecosystems."
