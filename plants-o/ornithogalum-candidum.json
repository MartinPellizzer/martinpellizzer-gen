    "intro": "Ornithogalum candidum, commonly known as the white star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the spring and summer months. The plant is characterized by its bulbous underground stem, which serves as a storage organ for nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Ornithogalum candidum is also noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its delicate, fragrant blooms."
