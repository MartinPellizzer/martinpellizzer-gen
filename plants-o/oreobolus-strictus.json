    "intro": "Oreobolus strictus, commonly known as the rigid sand sedge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal dunes or inland saline habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spikelets. It is adapted to withstand drought and salt stress, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. Oreobolus strictus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
