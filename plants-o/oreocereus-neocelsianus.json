    "intro": "Oreocereus neocelsianus, commonly known as the Neocelsianus Cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically green and covered with sparse, white spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months, usually in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
