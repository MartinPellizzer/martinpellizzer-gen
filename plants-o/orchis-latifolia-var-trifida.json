    "intro": "Orchis latifolia var. trifida, commonly known as the broad-leaved orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland areas and thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are often clustered in racemes and are pollinated by various insects, including bees and flies. This variant is distinguished by its trifid (three-lobed) leaves, which set it apart from other members of the species."
