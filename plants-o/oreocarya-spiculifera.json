    "intro": "Oreocarya spiculifera, commonly known as the spiny oreocarya, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, commonly known as the buckwheat family, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, spiny foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color, which bloom in late summer. Oreocarya spiculifera thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
