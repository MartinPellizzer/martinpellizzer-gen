    "intro": "Ophrys candica subsp. cytherea, commonly known as the Cytherean bee orchid, is a specialized orchid species native to parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. The subspecies is notable for its rare and localized distribution, making it a subject of interest in botanical and conservation studies."
