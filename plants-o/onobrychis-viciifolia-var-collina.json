    "intro": "Onobrychis viciifolia var. collina, commonly known as the alpine vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically hairy and have a distinctive heart-shaped base. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by narrow, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
