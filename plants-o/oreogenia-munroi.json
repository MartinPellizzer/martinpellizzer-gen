    "intro": "Oreogenia munroi, commonly known as the Munro's mountainflower, is a rare perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and strong winds. Oreogenia munroi thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
