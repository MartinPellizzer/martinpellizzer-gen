    "intro": "Osteocarpus lepidophyllus, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a unique species of leafy liverwort that exhibits remarkable desiccation tolerance. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky crevices or sandy soils. When dry, its leaves curl into a tight, bud-like structure, allowing it to survive extreme drought conditions. Upon rehydration, the plant rapidly unfolds, regaining its green, leafy appearance. This adaptation makes it an important example of extremophytic survival strategies in botanical studies."
