    "intro": "Orthochilus pottsii, commonly known as the Potts' orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Orthochilus pottsii is considered endangered, highlighting the need for its protection."
