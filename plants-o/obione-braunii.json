    "intro": "Obione braunii, commonly known as the Braun's obione, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Obione braunii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
