    "intro": "Orobanche aegyptiaca f. macrantha, commonly known as the Egyptian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and stems, with only a taproot system for attachment to host roots. The plant produces showy, often brightly colored flowers that are typically pink, purple, or white. It is native to regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East, often found in disturbed soils and agricultural areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops such as wheat and barley."
