    "intro": "Oreosedum hirsutum subsp. baeticum, commonly known as the Baetican oreosedum, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming during the summer months. It thrives in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
