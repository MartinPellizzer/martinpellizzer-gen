It features showy, fragrant flowers with a distinctive yellow pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Oncidium umbonatum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
