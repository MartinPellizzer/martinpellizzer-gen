    "intro": "Ormosia incerta, commonly known as the uncertain ormosia, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. Ormosia incerta typically grows in lowland tropical forests and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and understudied species in botanical research."
