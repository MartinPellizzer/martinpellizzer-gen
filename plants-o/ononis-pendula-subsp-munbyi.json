    "intro": "Ononis pendula subsp. munbyi, commonly known as the hanging sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal or inland dune environments. Its leaves are linear and fleshy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
