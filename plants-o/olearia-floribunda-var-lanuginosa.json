    "intro": "Olearia floribunda var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly dandelion, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, dandelion-like yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy white seed heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a valued plant in native gardens and conservation areas."
