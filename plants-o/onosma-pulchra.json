    "intro": "Onosma pulchra, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant once established. Onosma pulchra is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local pollinators."
