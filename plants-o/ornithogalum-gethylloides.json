    "intro": "Ornithogalum gethylloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved star-of-Bethleem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, rhizomatous stem and produces umbels of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often basal, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. The plant is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
