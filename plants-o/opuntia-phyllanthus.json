    "intro": "Opuntia phyllanthus, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy pads called cladodes, which are covered in sharp spines and glochids. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers, typically in the spring or early summer. Its fruits, known as tunas, are edible and have a sweet, tangy flavor. Opuntia phyllanthus is well adapted to arid environments and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various animals."
