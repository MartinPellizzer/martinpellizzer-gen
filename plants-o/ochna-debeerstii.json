    "intro": "Ochna debeerstii, commonly known as the Beetham ochna, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. Ochna debeerstii thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
