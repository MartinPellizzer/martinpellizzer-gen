    "intro": "Opuntia parmentieri, commonly known as the Florida prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and are often ribbed. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Opuntia parmentieri is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
