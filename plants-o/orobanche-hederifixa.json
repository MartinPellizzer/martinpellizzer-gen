    "intro": "Orobanche hederifixa, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow or green flowers and has a unique structure of tubular, thread-like stems that allow it to attach to its host. The plant is found in various regions, often in disturbed soils where it can easily infest crops and wild plants. Its life cycle involves germinating near a host plant and then establishing a connection through specialized roots called haustoria. Orobanche hederifixa is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to reduce crop yields."
