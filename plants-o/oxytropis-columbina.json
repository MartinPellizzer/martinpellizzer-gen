    "intro": "Oxytropis columbina, commonly known as Western yellow vetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. This plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility. Its seeds are adapted for dispersal by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively."
