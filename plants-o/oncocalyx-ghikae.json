    "intro": "Oncocalyx ghikae, commonly known as the Khasi orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the northeastern region of India. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers with a unique spurred lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oncocalyx ghikae is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
