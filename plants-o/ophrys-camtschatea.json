    "intro": "Ophrys camtschatea, commonly known as the Camtschatea bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves and a single, showy flower per stem. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Due to its specialized pollination mechanism and habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
