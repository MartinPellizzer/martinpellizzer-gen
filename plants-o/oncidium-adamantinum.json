    "intro": "Oncidium adamantinum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescences that bear clusters of bright yellow flowers. The plant has strap-shaped, dark green leaves that are often marked with silver or white veins. Oncidium adamantinum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
