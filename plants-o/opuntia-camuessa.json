    "intro": "Opuntia camuessa, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and are often ribbed. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which are followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia camuessa is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its structure and adaptations make it well-suited for survival in harsh, dry climates."
