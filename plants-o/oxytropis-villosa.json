    "intro": "Oxytropis villosa, commonly known as hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems covered in dense, white, silky hairs. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale blue to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its trifoliate leaves are palmately arranged and also bear a dense covering of soft, white hairs. Oxytropis villosa is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient, dry environments."
