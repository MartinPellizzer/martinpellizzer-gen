    "intro": "Oenanthe phellandrium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water dropwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along stream banks and wet meadows. The plant features slender, upright stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a distinctive aromatic scent. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels, blooming in early summer. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in wetland environments."
