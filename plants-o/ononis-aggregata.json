    "intro": "Ononis aggregata, commonly known as clustered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It has small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in clusters around the stem. The plant produces tiny white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and helps it survive in dry, sandy soils. Ononis aggregata is often found in disturbed areas and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
