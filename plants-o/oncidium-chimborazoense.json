    "intro": "Oncidium chimborazoense, commonly known as the Ecuadorian orchid, is a tropical plant native to the Andes mountains of Ecuador. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that bear showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, a common trait among epiphytic orchids. Oncidium chimborazoense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
