    "intro": "Oxydendrum arboreum, commonly known as the sourwood tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that turn a striking yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, showy white or pink flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a dry, capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds. The plant thrives in acidic soils and is often found in moist, wooded areas."
