    "intro": "Orchidantha ultramafica, commonly known as the ultramafic orchid, is a rare flowering plant adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, ultramafic soils. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant blooms. The plant exhibits specialized root systems that allow it to absorb essential minerals from its harsh environment. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Due to its unique ecological niche, it is considered a valuable indicator species for ultramafic habitats."
