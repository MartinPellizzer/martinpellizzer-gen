    "intro": "Ophrys aspea, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) native to Europe. It is renowned for its intricate flower structure that closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a unique combination of colors and patterns that mimic the appearance of its pollinator. The bee orchid is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes, often forming dense colonies in suitable environments."
