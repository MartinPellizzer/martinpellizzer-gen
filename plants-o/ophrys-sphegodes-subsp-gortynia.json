    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes subsp. gortynia, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive flower shape, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects. Ophrys sphegodes subsp. gortynia is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, often with a single, showy bloom."
