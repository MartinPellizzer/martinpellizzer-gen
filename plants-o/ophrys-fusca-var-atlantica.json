    "intro": "Ophrys fusca var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually dull green or brown, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
