    "intro": "Orobus pauciflorus, commonly known as the few-flowered orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has a short, erect stem with a few leaves and produces only a few flowers per inflorescence, hence its common name. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests or alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Orobus pauciflorus is considered a vulnerable species."
