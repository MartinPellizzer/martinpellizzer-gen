    "intro": "Orobanche genistae, commonly known as the yellow broom broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in association with legumes such as Genista species. Its life cycle involves germinating alongside its host and establishing a parasitic connection through specialized roots called haustoria. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants."
