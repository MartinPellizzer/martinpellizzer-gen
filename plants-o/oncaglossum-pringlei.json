    "intro": "Oncaglossum pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's lily, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of lance-shaped petals that are often tinged with green at the base. Oncaglossum pringlei is known for its delicate, ephemeral beauty and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
