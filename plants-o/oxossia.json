    "intro": "Oxossia, commonly known as the wax plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The flowers are typically showy, with vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow, attracting pollinators like birds and insects. Oxossia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, South America, and parts of Asia. These plants are often grown as ornamentals due to their striking appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
