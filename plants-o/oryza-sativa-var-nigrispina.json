    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. nigrispina, commonly known as black rice, is a variety of rice characterized by its dark purple to black grain color due to high concentrations of anthocyanins. This variety is native to Southeast Asia and is cultivated for its nutritional value and aesthetic appeal. The plant has a typical grass-like structure with hollow stems and narrow leaves, typical of the Poaceae family. It requires warm, humid climates and is often grown in flooded fields to promote growth and prevent weeds. Its grains are rich in antioxidants, fiber, and minerals, making it a valuable crop for both food and health purposes."
