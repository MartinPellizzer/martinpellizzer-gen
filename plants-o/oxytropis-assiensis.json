    "intro": "Oxytropis assiensis, commonly known as the Assi River milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats. Oxytropis assiensis is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in nutrient-poor environments."
