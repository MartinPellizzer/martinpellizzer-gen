    "intro": "Opuntia jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit, known as a tun, is edible and contains a sweet, pulpy interior. Opuntia jamaicensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient and drought-tolerant plant."
