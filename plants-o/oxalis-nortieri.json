    "intro": "Oxalis nortieri, commonly known as the silverleaf oxalis, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves with a silvery sheen and clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers. The plant prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and seasonal blooms. Oxalis nortieri is relatively low maintenance, though it may require careful watering to avoid root rot."
