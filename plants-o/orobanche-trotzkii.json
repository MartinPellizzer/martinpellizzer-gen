    "intro": "Orobanche trotzkii, commonly known as the Tibetan barrenweed, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in the Tibetan Plateau. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments by forming specialized structures called haustoria to attach to its host. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists studying parasitic plant interactions."
