    "intro": "Oxytropis arctica subsp. bellii, commonly known as Arctic lupine, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant has small, compound leaves and thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, supporting other plant life in harsh environments. Its adaptations include a deep root system and a short growing season to survive in cold climates."
