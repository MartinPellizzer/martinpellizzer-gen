    "intro": "Oreocharis rosthornii var. wenshanensis, commonly known as the Wenshan oreocharis, is a rare flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
