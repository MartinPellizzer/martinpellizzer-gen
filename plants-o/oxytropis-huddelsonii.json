    "intro": "Oxytropis huddelsonii, commonly known as Huddelson's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in arid and semi-arid regions. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow or pale yellow pea-like flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Oxytropis huddelsonii is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems."
