    "intro": "Orchis cordigera f. macrobracteata, commonly known as the broad-bract orchid, is a botanical variant of the common twayblade. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe, particularly in moist woodland habitats. The plant features a slender, leafless stem that bears a single, showy orchid flower with a distinctive lip. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette at the base, and the inflorescence is characterized by the presence of broad, leaf-like bracts. This orchid is notable for its specialized pollination mechanisms and its role in supporting local insect biodiversity."
