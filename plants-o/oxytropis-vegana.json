    "intro": "Oxytropis vegana, commonly known as the desert locoweed, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor, sandy soils. Its leaves are typically small and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Oxytropis vegana is also known for its toxic properties, containing alkaloids that can be harmful to livestock."
