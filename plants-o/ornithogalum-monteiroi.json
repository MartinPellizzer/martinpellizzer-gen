    "intro": "Ornithogalum monteiroi, commonly known as the Monteiro's star-of-Bethlehem, is a rare and striking bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its underground bulb, which stores nutrients for growth. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
