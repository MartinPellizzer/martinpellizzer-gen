    "intro": "Ophrys tenthredinifera var. ficalhoana, commonly known as the Ficalho's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Azores. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with intricate patterns that enhance the mimicry. The species is of interest to botanists due to its specific ecological requirements and limited distribution."
