    "intro": "Opuntia fragilis var. parviconspicua, commonly known as the brittle prickly pear, is a low-growing cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features flattened, fleshy stems that are typically green to blue-green in color, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its pads are generally shorter and more compact compared to other Opuntia species, and it is known for its fragile, easily broken stems. This variety is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
