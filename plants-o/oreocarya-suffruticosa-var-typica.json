    "intro": "Oreocarya suffruticosa var. typica, commonly known as the Sierra stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically forms dense mats of succulent, fleshy leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. Its succulent leaves store water, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping."
