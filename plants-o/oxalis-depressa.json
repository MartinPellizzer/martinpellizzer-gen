    "intro": "Oxalis depressa, commonly known as the dwarf wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive yellowish-green color and produces delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to white. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves and flowers are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. Oxalis depressa is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
