    "intro": "Oldenlandia virgata, commonly known as the silverleaf or white-flowered spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender stems and opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Oldenlandia virgata is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas, such as forest understories or along stream banks."
