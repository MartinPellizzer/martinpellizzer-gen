    "intro": "Oxalis psammophila, commonly known as sand oxalis, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, five-petaled flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Oxalis psammophila is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
