    "intro": "Ochna atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple ochna, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn reddish-purple in the autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. These flowers are followed by distinctive, winged fruits that split open to release seeds. Ochna atropurpurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking foliage and seasonal blooms."
