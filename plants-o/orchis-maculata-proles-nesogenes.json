It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, woodland habitats, often in partial shade. The plant has a rhizomatous root system and produces erect, hairy stems that bear clusters of small, fragrant flowers. Its pollination is primarily achieved through insect visitors, particularly bees and wasps. The species is also noted for its ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity and is often found in conservation areas."
