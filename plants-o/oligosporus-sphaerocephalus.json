It belongs to the fungal kingdom and is primarily found in soil and decaying organic matter. The plant's reproductive structure consists of compact, round spores that are released into the environment. These spores are adapted for dispersal and germination under favorable conditions. Its botanical significance lies in its role in nutrient cycling and ecological balance within its habitat."
