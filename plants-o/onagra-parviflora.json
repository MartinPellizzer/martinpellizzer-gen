    "intro": "Onagra parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the genus Onagra in the family Onagraceae, which includes other species known for their showy flowers and medicinal properties. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are hairy and often branched. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution across arid and semi-arid regions."
