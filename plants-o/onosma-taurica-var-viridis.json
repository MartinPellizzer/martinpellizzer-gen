    "intro": "Onosma taurica var. viridis, commonly known as the green tauric onosma, is a perennial herb native to the Caucasus region. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. It is often found in open habitats such as steppes and forest edges. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
