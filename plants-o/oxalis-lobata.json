    "intro": "Oxalis lobata, commonly known as the pink woodsorrel, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial with trifoliate leaves and small, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its foliage resembles that of clover, and it is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Oxalis lobata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable environments."
