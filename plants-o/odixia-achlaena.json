    "intro": "Odixia achlaena, commonly known as the dark-leaved ironwood, is a rare and woody shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow. The plant produces small, hard, black seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
