    "intro": "Oenocarpus seje, commonly known as the West African oil palm, is a tropical plant native to western Africa. It is a member of the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves and tall, slender trunk. The plant produces clustered inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, facilitating cross-pollination. Its fruit, which contains a valuable oil-rich kernel, is an important agricultural product in the region. The plant's botanical features make it well-adapted to warm, humid climates and nutrient-rich soils."
