    "intro": "Oreorchis rockii, commonly known as the Chinese twayblade, is a rare orchid species native to China. It is a small herbaceous plant with a slender stem and two opposite leaves. The plant produces a single spike of pale yellow or greenish-white flowers, which are typically short-lived. Oreorchis rockii thrives in rocky, well-drained habitats and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
