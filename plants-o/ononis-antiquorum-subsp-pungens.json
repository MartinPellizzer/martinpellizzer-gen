    "intro": "Ononis antiquorum subsp. pungens, commonly known as the spiny rockcress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in dry, sunny environments. The plant features basal leaves that are lanceolate and covered with fine hairs, while its flowering stems bear small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Its subspecies name, *pungens*, refers to the sharp, bristly hairs on its stems and leaves. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
