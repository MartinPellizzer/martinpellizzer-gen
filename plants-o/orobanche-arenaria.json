    "intro": "Orobanche arenaria, commonly known as the sand dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a specialized root system that attaches to the roots of its host. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of specific host species, often within the Chenopodiaceae family. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its habitat."
