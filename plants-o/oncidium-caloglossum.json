    "intro": "Oncidium caloglossum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting yellow flowers that resemble a cluster of golden fingers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, well-lit environments. Oncidium caloglossum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
