    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 pseudofunerea, commonly known as the mimic orchid, is a hybrid species within the Ophrys genus, known for its striking floral morphology. It exhibits a complex structure with a single, showy lip that mimics the appearance of a female insect, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in temperate regions, favoring moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette, while the inflorescence consists of a single, erect spike bearing several flowers. Botanically, it is notable for its intricate floral adaptations and genetic diversity resulting from crossbreeding with other Ophrys species."
