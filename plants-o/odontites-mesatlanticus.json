    "intro": "Odontites mesatlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic toothed grass, is a small, perennial herb native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic Ocean. It is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its name refers to the tooth-like serrations on its leaf margins, which are a distinctive botanical feature. Odontites mesatlanticus is adapted to tolerate salt spray and strong winds, making it an important component of coastal vegetation."
