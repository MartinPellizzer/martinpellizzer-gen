    "intro": "Orobanche mutelii var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or reddish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and agricultural fields. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are reduced to scale-like structures, and it produces numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants, making it a concern in some agricultural settings."
