    "intro": "Onosma wallichiana var. egregia, commonly known as the Himalayan sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in alpine gardens."
