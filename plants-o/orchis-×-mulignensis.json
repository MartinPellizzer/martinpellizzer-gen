    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 mulignensis, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Orchis morio and Orchis mascula. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers with a distinctive spurred lip, characteristic of many orchid species. It has a fibrous root system and is often found in the temperate regions of Europe. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on the parent species."
