    "intro": "Ornithidium ruberrimum, commonly known as the red-stemmed fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green with a reddish hue on the stems. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture to flourish. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor cultivation. Ornithidium ruberrimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and air-purifying properties."
