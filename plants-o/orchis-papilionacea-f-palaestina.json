    "intro": "Orchis papilionacea f. palaestina, commonly known as the Palestine orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to the Middle East. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers with a yellow throat, which resemble butterflies, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in mountainous regions. It has a short, fleshy rhizome and produces a single, erect flowering stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
