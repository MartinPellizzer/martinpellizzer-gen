    "intro": "Osmunda palustris, commonly known as the marsh fern, is a perennial fern native to wetland habitats in North America. It has a distinctive, upright frond structure with a central stem and a fan-shaped crown of leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing clusters called sori on the underside of its fronds. Osmunda palustris thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along stream banks. Its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions makes it an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
