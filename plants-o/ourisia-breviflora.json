    "intro": "Ourisia breviflora, commonly known as the dwarf ourisia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of delicate, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
