It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pink or red flowers that bloom in upright clusters. The plant has a deep root system that helps in soil fixation and nutrient cycling. It is often used in forage agriculture and as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Its botanical features make it valuable in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
