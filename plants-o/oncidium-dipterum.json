    "intro": "Oncidium dipterum, commonly known as the Butterfly Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features long, arching stems with clusters of pendulous, fragrant flowers that resemble butterflies in shape and color. The plant has strap-like leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Oncidium dipterum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouses."
