    "intro": "Ouratea bracteata, commonly known as the velvetwood or bractean ouratea, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in white or pale yellow. The plant has a thick, woody trunk with a smooth, almost velvety texture, which gives it its common name. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly waxy appearance. The tree is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in warm climates for its aesthetic appeal."
