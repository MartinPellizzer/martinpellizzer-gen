    "intro": "Oxalis lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically narrow and lance-shaped, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in spring. Oxalis lancifolia thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
