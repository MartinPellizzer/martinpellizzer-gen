    "intro": "Oncidium uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flower orchid, is a tropical orchid species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and the production of a single, showy flower per stem. The plant typically features long, strap-like leaves and a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients. Its flowers are usually yellow or green with intricate patterns, and they bloom in the spring or early summer. Oncidium uniflorum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers."
