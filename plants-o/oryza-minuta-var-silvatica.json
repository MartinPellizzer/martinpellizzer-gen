It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, rice-like grains. This variety thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its compact size and rapid growth make it an important component of the ecosystem in its native habitat. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
