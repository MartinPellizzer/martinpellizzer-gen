    "intro": "Opuntia ambigua, commonly known as the desert nightshade cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are typically ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its fruit, a red, fleshy pear, contains seeds that are dispersed by animals. Opuntia ambigua is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and reducing transpiration through its spiny covering."
