    "intro": "Oncidium pulvinatum var. majus, commonly known as the showy oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features striking, pendulous inflorescences with bright yellow petals and a deep orange lip, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often in shades of yellow and orange, and it thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light. Oncidium pulvinatum var. majus requires well-draining potting media and regular watering to maintain its health and promote blooming."
