    "intro": "Ophrys bombyliflora var. albarranii, commonly known as the white orchid of the Iberian Peninsula, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Spain and northern Africa. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually pale or white in color, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
