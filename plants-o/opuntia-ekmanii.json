    "intro": "Opuntia ekmanii, commonly known as the Ekman's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Baja California, Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in sharp spines and clusters of small, glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. Opuntia ekmanii is well adapted to harsh desert environments, storing water in its thick stems and photosynthesizing efficiently in full sun."
