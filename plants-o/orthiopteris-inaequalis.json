    "intro": "Orthiopteris inaequalis, commonly known as the unequal maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. The plant's intricate structure and elegant appearance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
