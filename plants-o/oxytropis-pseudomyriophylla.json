It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Oxytropis pseudomyriophylla plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
