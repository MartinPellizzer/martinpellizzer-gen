    "intro": "Onobroma hispanicum, commonly known as the Spanish torch or Spanish lantern, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in arid and semi-arid regions. The fruit, which resembles a small lantern, contains seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in natural habitats."
