    "intro": "Orchis morio proles picta, commonly known as the painted twayblade, is a species of orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a small, perennial herb that typically grows in woodland and grassland habitats. The plant has a slender, unbranched stem that often bears a single, narrow leaf. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, with a distinctive purple or red stripe running down the center of each petal. The species is notable for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption."
