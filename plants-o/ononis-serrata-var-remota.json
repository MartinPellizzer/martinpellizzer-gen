    "intro": "Ononis serrata var. remota, commonly known as the remote sandspurry, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and hardy nature, it is considered a valuable plant for erosion control in arid environments."
