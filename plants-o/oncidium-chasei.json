    "intro": "Oncidium chasei, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, showy inflorescences that typically feature bright yellow flowers with contrasting red or brown markings. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Oncidium chasei is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for novice orchid growers. Its flowers bloom in clusters and can last for several weeks, adding vibrant color to indoor or outdoor gardens."
