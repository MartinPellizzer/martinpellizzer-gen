    "intro": "Osmunda pilosa, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a distinctive hairy texture on the underside of the leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories across temperate regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typically in clusters. Osmunda pilosa is known for its ancient lineage, with fossil records dating back over 300 million years."
