    "intro": "Oxygyne shinzatoi, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to Japan. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in shaded wetlands and along the edges of ponds. The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that float on the water surface, aiding in photosynthesis. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typically requiring specific conditions for successful propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
