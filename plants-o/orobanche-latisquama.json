    "intro": "Orobanche latisquama, commonly known as the broad-leafed broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to regions of southern Europe and the Mediterranean. The plant produces showy, often pink or purple, flowers that bloom in summer. Its roots are specialized to attach to the roots of host plants, such as those in the legume family. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth of its host plants."
