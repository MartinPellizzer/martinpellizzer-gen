    "intro": "Oenothera quadrivulnera var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy four-vein evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its varietal name \"hirsuta.\" The plant produces showy yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its scientific name reflects its four veins in the leaves, a distinctive botanical feature. Oenothera quadrivulnera var. hirsuta is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
