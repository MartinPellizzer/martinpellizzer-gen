    "intro": "Oxalis calachaccensis, commonly known as the Calachaccensis wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release seeds, a feature common in many members of its family. Oxalis calachaccensis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
