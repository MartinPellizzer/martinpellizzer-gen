    "intro": "Oedera prolifera, commonly known as the creeping marsh plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It features a prostrate growth habit with numerous stolons that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with hairy surfaces, and small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along water edges. Oedera prolifera plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
