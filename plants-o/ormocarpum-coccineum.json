    "intro": "Ormocarpum coccineum, commonly known as the scarlet sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with distinctive, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, showy flowers that range in color from red to pink, which bloom in late summer. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds. Ormocarpum coccineum is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
