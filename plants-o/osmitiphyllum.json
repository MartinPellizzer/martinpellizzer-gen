    "intro": "Osmitiphyllum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, spiky blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often growing in dunes or along the coastline. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Osmitiphyllum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in coastal gardens."
