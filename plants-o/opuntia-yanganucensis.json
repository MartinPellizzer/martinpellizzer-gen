It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in clusters of spines and glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soil conditions and low rainfall. Opuntia yanganucensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
