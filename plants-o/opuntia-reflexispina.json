    "intro": "Opuntia reflexispina, commonly known as the reflexispina prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed hairs. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia reflexispina is adapted to arid environments and has a slow growth rate, making it a hardy, low-maintenance plant. Its structure and features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant."
