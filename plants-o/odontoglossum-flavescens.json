It is characterized by its striking yellow petals and a distinctive, elongated lip that sets it apart from other orchid species. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers bloom in late summer and early autumn, adding vibrant color to its natural habitat. Odontoglossum flavescens is prized by horticulturists for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its beauty."
