    "intro": "Orchis triphylla, commonly known as the three-lobed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces showy, violet or purple flowers in late spring, which are arranged in a loose spike. Orchis triphylla is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It is a perennial herb that plays a role in supporting local pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
