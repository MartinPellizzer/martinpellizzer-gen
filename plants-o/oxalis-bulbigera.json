    "intro": "Oxalis bulbigera, commonly known as the bulbous wood sorrel, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick rhizome from which several fleshy, bulb-like tubers arise. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves with distinctive reddish veins and clusters of five-petaled yellow flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Oxalis bulbigera is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
