    "intro": "Ophrys vitorica, commonly known as the Vitoria orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a terrestrial herb with a short, thick rhizome and a single, fleshy, greenish-yellow stem. The plant produces a single, showy, lip-like flower that resembles a female bee, a feature that aids in its unique pollination strategy. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to greenish in color with intricate patterns. Ophrys vitorica thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges."
