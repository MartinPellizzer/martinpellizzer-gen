    "intro": "Ortholoma repens, commonly known as the creeping ortholoma, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a dense, mat-like structure, helping it to retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers are usually pale blue or purple and appear in clusters, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Ortholoma repens is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its role in supporting local wildlife."
