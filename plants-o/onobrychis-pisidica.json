    "intro": "Onobrychis pisidica, commonly known as Turkish clover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in poor, dry soils. It is often found in rocky or limestone habitats, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a notable species in botanical studies and landscaping."
