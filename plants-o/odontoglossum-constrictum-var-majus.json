This variety is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter, featuring vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in its high-altitude, cool climate. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it blooms during the cooler months. Odontoglossum constrictum var. majus is prized for its ornamental value and is cultivated by orchid enthusiasts worldwide."
