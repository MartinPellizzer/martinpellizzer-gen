    "intro": "Orinus kokonorica, commonly known as the Tibetan bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and neighboring areas. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Orinus kokonorica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
