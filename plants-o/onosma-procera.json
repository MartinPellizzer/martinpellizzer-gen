    "intro": "Onosma procera, commonly known as the tall honesty, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release its seeds, a feature that gives it its common name. Onosma procera is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
