    "intro": "Omphalophthalma rubra, commonly known as the red-eyed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red petals and sepals that contrast with its greenish-yellow throat. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests. Its flowers are fragrant and attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies. The orchid's roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of trees rather than in soil."
