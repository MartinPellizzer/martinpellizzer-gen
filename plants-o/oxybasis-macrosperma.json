    "intro": "Oxybasis macrosperma, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy white to pale pink flowers. The plant has a rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. Its bulbs store nutrients and water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry conditions. Oxybasis macrosperma is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
