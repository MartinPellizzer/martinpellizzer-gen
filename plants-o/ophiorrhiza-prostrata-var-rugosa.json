    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza prostrata var. rugosa, commonly known as the hairy prostrate ophiorrhiza, is a low-growing shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate habit, with stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The leaves are typically elliptical, with a rough texture due to the presence of small, stiff hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near water bodies. The plant has small white or pale yellow flowers and produces capsule fruits, making it a common species in tropical wetlands."
