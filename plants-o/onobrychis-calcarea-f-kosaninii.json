    "intro": "Onobrychis calcarea f. kosaninii, commonly known as the Kosanin's oxytropis, is a rare and specialized legume native to the mountainous regions of the former Yugoslavia. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. It is a member of the Fabaceae family and exhibits a low-growing, cushion-like growth form. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
