    "intro": "Orchis viridis, commonly known as the green orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and delicate, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are usually arranged in a spike and bloom from late spring to early summer. Orchis viridis is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with other orchid species."
