    "intro": "Ophioglossum kawamurae, commonly known as the Kawamura's adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species native to Japan. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, elongated leaf that resembles an adder's tongue. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaf, which are clustered in a structure called a sorus. Ophioglossum kawamurae is a member of the Ophioglossaceae family, which is one of the oldest groups of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
