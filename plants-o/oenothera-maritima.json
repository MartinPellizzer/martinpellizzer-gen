    "intro": "Oenothera maritima, commonly known as sea evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its yellow to orange flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and dunes, demonstrating its adaptability to harsh, saline environments. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Oenothera maritima is also known for its medicinal properties, with its seeds containing high levels of essential fatty acids."
