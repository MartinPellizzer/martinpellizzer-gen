    "intro": "Oiospermum involucratum, commonly known as the woolly everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant is notable for its dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, bloom in late summer and early autumn. Oiospermum involucratum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
