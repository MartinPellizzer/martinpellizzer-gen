    "intro": "Ornithogalum altaicum, commonly known as the highland star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers with six petals, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Ornithogalum altaicum is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance."
