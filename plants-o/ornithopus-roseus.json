    "intro": "Ornithopus roseus, commonly known as the pink scabious, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often mistaken for dandelions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Ornithopus roseus is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
