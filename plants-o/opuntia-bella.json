    "intro": "Opuntia bella, commonly known as the beautiful prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems, which are covered in small, sharp spines and glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tunaf, is edible and often used in culinary applications. Opuntia bella is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
