    "intro": "Ocotea deflexa, commonly known as the Brazilian camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, glossy leaves and cylindrical, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by dark blue, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. Its essential oils, extracted from the leaves and bark, are used in traditional medicine and as a source of camphor. Ocotea deflexa thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests."
