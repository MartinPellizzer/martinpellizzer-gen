    "intro": "Ochthocosmus candidus, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a slightly hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Ochthocosmus candidus is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
