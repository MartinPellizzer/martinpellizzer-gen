    "intro": "Oplismenus crus-galli var. muticus, commonly known as the silent cow's tail, is a variant of the common cow's tail plant. It is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States, characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swamps. Its leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces seed capsules that release tiny seeds when mature. This variety is notable for its reduced flowering compared to the typical form, contributing to its common name."
