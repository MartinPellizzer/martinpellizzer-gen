    "intro": "Oncosporum microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaf oncospore, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has finely divided, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbrella-like structures, typical of the carrot family. The roots of Oncosporum microphyllum are fibrous and can be used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported medicinal properties."
