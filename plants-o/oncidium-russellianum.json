    "intro": "Oncidium russellianum, commonly known as the Russell's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in clusters of yellow and green hues. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are epiphytic, allowing it to grow on trees without being parasitic. Oncidium russellianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its long-lasting blooms."
