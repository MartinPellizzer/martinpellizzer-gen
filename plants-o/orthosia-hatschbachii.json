    "intro": "Orthosia hatschbachii, commonly known as the Hatschbach's orthosia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, while its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Orthosia hatschbachii is considered a species of conservation concern."
