    "intro": "Orobanche pubescens var. campuliflora, commonly known as the hairy broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or reddish, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, often parasitizing grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its small, scale-like leaves are reduced, and it produces numerous small, delicate flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem, influencing host plant populations and contributing to biodiversity."
