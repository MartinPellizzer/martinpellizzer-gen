    "intro": "Ouratea pisiformis, commonly known as the red-leaf ouratea, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, glossy, dark red to purple leaves that contrast beautifully with its small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically orange to red in color, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for tropical gardens and indoor plant collections."
