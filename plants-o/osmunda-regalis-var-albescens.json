It is a member of the Osmundaceae family and is native to wetlands and stream banks in eastern North America. The plant features large, pinnately divided fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. It reproduces via spores, with the fertile fronds producing spore cases called sorus. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to moist, acidic soils."
