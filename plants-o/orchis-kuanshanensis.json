It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking purple or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, preferring rich, well-drained soils. Its unique floral structure includes a lip that is often adorned with intricate patterns, aiding in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
