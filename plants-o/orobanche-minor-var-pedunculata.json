    "intro": "Orobanche minor var. pedunculata, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing species within the Fabaceae family. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in clusters, and its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of its host. It is found in various regions of Europe and is often associated with disturbed or arable soils. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on agricultural crops."
