    "intro": "Onoclea sensibilis f. hemiphyllodes, commonly known as the hemiphyllous fern, is a variant of the sensitive fern characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a unique structure that features a partially divided lamina, giving it a distinct appearance compared to the typical form. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the pinnae, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family. The plant's sensitivity to environmental changes makes it an indicator species for ecological health."
