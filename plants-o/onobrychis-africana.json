    "intro": "Onobrychis africana, commonly known as the African burclover, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grassland and savanna habitats. The plant produces small, yellow to brown flowers arranged in spikes, which are visited by various pollinators. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Onobrychis africana is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment."
