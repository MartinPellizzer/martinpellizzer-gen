    "intro": "Olinia discolor, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The tree produces small, white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing a single seed. Its bark is thick and dark, often used in traditional medicine, while its wood is valued for its durability and fine grain. Olinia discolor plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
