    "intro": "Oenothera hispidula, commonly known as the hispid evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas. Its seeds are encased in a capsule that splits open to release the seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Oenothera hispidula is also known for its medicinal properties, with some parts of the plant used in traditional herbal remedies."
