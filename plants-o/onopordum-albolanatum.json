    "intro": "Onopordum albolanatum, commonly known as the white thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a robust stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, covered in spiny leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flower heads that are surrounded by bracts, which are modified leaves that form the involucre. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a rough, hairy texture, while its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets. Onopordum albolanatum is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and wastelands."
