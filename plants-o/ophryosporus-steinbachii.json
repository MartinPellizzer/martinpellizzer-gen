    "intro": "Ophryosporus steinbachii, commonly known as the yellow starburst cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a spiny exterior and produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a shallow root system and is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The plant's flowers are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
