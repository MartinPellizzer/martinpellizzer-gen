    "intro": "Odontadenia lucida, commonly known as the mountain gum or blackwood, is a small evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sclerophyllous forests. The plant has smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are leathery and glossy. It produces small, yellow flowers in late spring, followed by woody pods that contain flat, oval seeds. Odontadenia lucida is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in traditional Aboriginal crafts."
