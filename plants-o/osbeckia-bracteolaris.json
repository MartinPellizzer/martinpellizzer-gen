    "intro": "Osbeckia bracteolaris, commonly known as the narrow-leaved osbeckia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers with five petals, which bloom in the spring and summer months. Osbeckia bracteolaris is adapted to grow in high-altitude environments, often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in alpine botany and ecological research."
