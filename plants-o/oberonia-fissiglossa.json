    "intro": "Oberonia fissiglossa, commonly known as the slit-lip orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a loose spike, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. Oberonia fissiglossa thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on the forest floor or among leaf litter. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
