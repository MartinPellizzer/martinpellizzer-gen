    "intro": "Ononis decumbens, commonly known as creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically forms dense mats of prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread effectively across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Ononis decumbens is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
