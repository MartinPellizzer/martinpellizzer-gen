    "intro": "Onopordum hinojense, commonly known as the Hinojosa thistle, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often in open woodlands or scrublands. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in arid conditions. The species is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other thistle and daisy-like plants."
