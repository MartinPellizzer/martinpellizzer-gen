    "intro": "Orobanche hirta, commonly known as the hairy broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive hairy appearance on its stems and leaves. It typically parasitizes a range of host plants, including those in the legume and grass families. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological systems, though it can sometimes be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
