    "intro": "Orobanche sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is often found growing on the roots of grasses and legumes. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and productivity of its host plants."
