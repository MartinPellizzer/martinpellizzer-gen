    "intro": "Oldenlandia coccinea, commonly known as the red mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking red bracts that resemble flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its showy inflorescences consist of small white flowers surrounded by bright red, leaf-like bracts. Oldenlandia coccinea is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
