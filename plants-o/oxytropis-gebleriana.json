    "intro": "Oxytropis gebleriana, commonly known as Gebler's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant has trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Oxytropis gebleriana plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
