    "intro": "Olearia stellulata, commonly known as the starflower or silver star, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps it reflect sunlight in its native habitat. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils. Olearia stellulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
