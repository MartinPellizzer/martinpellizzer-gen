    "intro": "Ophrys albanica, commonly known as the Albanian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkans. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ophrys albanica is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
