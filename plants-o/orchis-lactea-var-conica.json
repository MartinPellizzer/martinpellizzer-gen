    "intro": "Orchis lactea var. conica, commonly known as the conical milk orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. The plant features a tall, unbranched stem that can reach up to 1 meter in height, topped with a dense cluster of pale yellow to white flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged along the stem, while the roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor conditions. The species is notable for its distinctive conical shape and is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution."
