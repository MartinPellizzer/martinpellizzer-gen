    "intro": "Oncotheca macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae and is characterized by its distinctive, inflated seed pods that resemble bladders. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, and its leaves are alternate, pinnately lobed, and covered in fine hairs. The seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, three-lobed capsule that splits open when mature to release the seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
