    "intro": "Ossaea coriacea, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant. Ossaea coriacea is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, low-nutrient conditions."
