    "intro": "Oxytropis subverticillaris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, compound leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, raceme-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Oxytropis subverticillaris is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment."
