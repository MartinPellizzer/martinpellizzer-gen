    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 calypsus, commonly known as the bee orchid hybrid, is a fascinating plant with intricate botanical features. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid), resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. The plant is characterized by its striking, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance and scent of female bees, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. It typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in various habitats across Europe. Its morphology includes a basal rosette of leaves and a flowering stem that can reach up to 50 cm in height."
