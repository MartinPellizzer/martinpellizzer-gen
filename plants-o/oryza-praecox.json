    "intro": "Oryza praecox, commonly known as early rice, is a species of grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. Oryza praecox is an important wild relative of cultivated rice, contributing to genetic diversity and breeding programs."
