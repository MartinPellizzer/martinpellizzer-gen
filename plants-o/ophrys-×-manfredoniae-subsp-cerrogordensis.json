    "intro": "[WRONG START] Ophrys \u00d7 manfredrede subsp. cerrogordensis, commonly known as the Sierra de Gredos orchid, is a rare hybrid orchid native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the genus Ophrys, which is known for its mimicry of female insects to attract male pollinators. This subspecies is characterized by its intricate, bee-mimicking flowers that play a crucial role in its pollination strategy. It thrives in rocky, mountainous habitats and is adapted to the specific microclimates of its native range. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
