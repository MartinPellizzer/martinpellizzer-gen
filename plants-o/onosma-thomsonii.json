    "intro": "Onosma thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow to orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Thomson's fleabane is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds."
