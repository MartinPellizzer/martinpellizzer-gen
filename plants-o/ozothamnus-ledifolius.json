    "intro": "Ozothamnus ledifolius, commonly known as silverleaf dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray, woolly foliage and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Ozothamnus ledifolius is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses involving its leaves and flowers."
