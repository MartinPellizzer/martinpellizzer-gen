It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and showy, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, tuberous roots that help it survive in its native environment. The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is often found in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal."
