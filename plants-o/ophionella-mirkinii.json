    "intro": "Ophionella mirkinii, commonly known as the Mirkin's lily, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Chile. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically blooms in late winter to early spring, adapting to the cool, humid conditions of its high-altitude habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Ophionella mirkinii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
