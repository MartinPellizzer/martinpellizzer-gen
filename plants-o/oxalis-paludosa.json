    "intro": "Oxalis paludosa, commonly known as swamp wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features heart-shaped leaves with distinctive reddish veins and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Oxalis paludosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
