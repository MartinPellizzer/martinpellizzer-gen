    "intro": "Oreogrammitis peregrina, commonly known as the wandering wall-rush, is a member of the fern family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like appearance. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures. Oreogrammitis peregrina is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it a resilient species in challenging habitats. Its botanical features make it an important indicator of specific ecological conditions in its native range."
