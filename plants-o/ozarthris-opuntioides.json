    "intro": "Ozarthris opuntioides, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by edible, berry-like fruits. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments. Ozarthris opuntioides is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the production of its fruit."
