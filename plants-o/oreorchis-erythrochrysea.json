It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces pendulous, yellow to orange flowers with a distinctive red lip, which is a key feature for its identification. Oreorchis erythrochrysea thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. It is a perennial species that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological significance in its native habitats."
