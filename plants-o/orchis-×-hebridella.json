    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 hebridella, commonly known as the Hebridean orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between the early purple orchid (Orchis mascula) and the common spotted orchid (Dactylorhiza fuchsii). It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear clusters of violet or purple flowers with a distinctive spurred lip. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland and grassland habitats across the British Isles. Its flowers are hermaphroditic, with a complex structure that facilitates pollination by bees and other insects. This hybrid is notable for its genetic diversity and adaptability to varying environmental conditions."
