It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. It thrives in humid, cool environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
