    "intro": "Osmoxylon boerlagei, commonly known as the Boerlage's osmoxylon, is a unique plant species belonging to the family Meliaceae. It is characterized by its woody structure and distinctive leaf morphology, with lanceolate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Osmoxylon boerlagei is native to specific regions in Africa, particularly in countries like Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and understudied species in botanical research."
