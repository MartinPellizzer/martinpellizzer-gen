    "intro": "Octoknema aruwimiensis, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Lecanodermataceae and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly waxy texture, contributing to its adaptability in various environmental conditions. Due to its ornamental value and timber quality, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
