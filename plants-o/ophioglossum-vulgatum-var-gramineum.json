    "intro": "Ophioglossum vulgatum var. gramineum, commonly known as the common adder's tongue fern, is a unique fern species characterized by its distinctive morphology. It features a single, upright, leafless spore-bearing stalk that terminates in a broad, tongue-shaped fertile frond. The plant exhibits a primitive structure, with a short rhizome and a single, elongated sporophyll that bears spores on its underside. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This variety is notable for its conservation status and is often considered a relict species with limited distribution."
