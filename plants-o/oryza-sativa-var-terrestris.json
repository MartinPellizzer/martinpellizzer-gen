    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. terrestris, commonly known as the dwarf rice plant, is a lesser-known variant of the rice species. It is characterized by its short stature and compact growth habit, which distinguishes it from the more commonly cultivated rice varieties. This plant typically produces small, grass-like leaves and has a short flowering period. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a spikelet structure typical of the grass family. While not widely farmed, it is of interest in botanical studies for its genetic diversity and potential agricultural applications."
