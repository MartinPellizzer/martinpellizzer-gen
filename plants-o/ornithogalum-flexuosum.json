    "intro": "Ornithogalum flexuosum, commonly known as the creeping belladonna, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The plant produces clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers with six petals, often resembling lilies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. Ornithogalum flexuosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
