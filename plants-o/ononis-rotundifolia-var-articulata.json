    "intro": "Ononis rotundifolia var. articulata, commonly known as the jointed globe-thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a compact, globular shape with dense, spiny leaves that are rounded and often tinged with purple. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in loose racemes. Its leaves are typically divided into segments, and the stems are often jointed, giving it its common name. It is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides."
