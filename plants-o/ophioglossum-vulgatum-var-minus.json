    "intro": "Ophioglossum vulgatum var. minus, commonly known as the lesser adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species characterized by its unique leaf structure. It features a long, narrow, sword-shaped leaf that is divided into two distinct parts: a lower, broad segment and an upper, narrow, tongue-like portion. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its sterile fronds, which are clustered in a distinctive, spore-bearing structure called a sorus. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
