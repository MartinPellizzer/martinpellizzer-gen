It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shores, showing a preference for tropical and subtropical climates. It is noted for its limited distribution and is considered a species of conservation concern due to habitat degradation. Ophiorrhiza liangkwangensis plays a minor but ecologically significant role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
