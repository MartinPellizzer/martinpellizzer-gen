    "intro": "Oryzopsis holciformis f. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf grass, is a variant of the species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its broader, more robust leaves compared to the typical form, which contributes to its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical cluster of spikelets, which are arranged in a compact panicle. This grass is often used in restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological benefits."
