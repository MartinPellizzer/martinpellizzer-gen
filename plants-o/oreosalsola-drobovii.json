    "intro": "Oreosalsola drobovii, commonly known as the Drobovii's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, often fragrant blooms. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oreosalsola drobovii is considered a species of conservation concern."
