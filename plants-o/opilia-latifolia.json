    "intro": "Opilia latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf opilia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its small, white to pale pink flowers are clustered in umbellate inflorescences, and it produces small, round berries that are edible. Opilia latifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage and floral display."
