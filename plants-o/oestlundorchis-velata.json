    "intro": "Oestlundorchis velata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, as it lacks chlorophyll and cannot photosynthesize. Its slender, wiry stems are often found growing on tree trunks or branches, a characteristic known as epiphytic growth. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Oestlundorchis velata is listed as endangered in several states."
