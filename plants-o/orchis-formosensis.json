    "intro": "Orchis formosensis, commonly known as the Formosan orchid, is a perennial herb native to Taiwan. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest areas, where it thrives in the understory vegetation. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, while its flowers are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Orchis formosensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
