    "intro": "Orchis sambucina f. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to wetland habitats in Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and showy, violet-purple flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing a single or few flower spikes. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, fen meadows, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
