    "intro": "Orchidium americanum, commonly known as the American orchid, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family, which includes a wide variety of orchids, though it is not a true orchid in the traditional sense. The plant is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Orchidium americanum is considered a threatened species in its native range."
