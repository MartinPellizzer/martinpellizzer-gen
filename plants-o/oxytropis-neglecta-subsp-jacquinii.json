    "intro": "Oxytropis neglecta subsp. jacquinii, commonly known as yellow milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, spindly inflorescences. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant is adapted to arid environments and has deep taproots that help it survive in poor soil conditions."
