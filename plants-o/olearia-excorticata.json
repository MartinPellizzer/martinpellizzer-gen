    "intro": "Olearia excorticata, commonly known as the silverweed tree or silver tree, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, fine hairs covering the leaves and stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. Olearia excorticata is often found in coastal and inland forests, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a notable species in New Zealand's flora."
