    "intro": "Oenanthe peucedanifolia var. lachenalii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hemlock, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typical of the Apiaceae family. The plant is native to southern Europe and thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its aromatic foliage contains compounds that can be toxic, similar to other members of its family. The flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
