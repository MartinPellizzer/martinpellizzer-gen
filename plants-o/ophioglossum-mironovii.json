    "intro": "Ophioglossum mironovii, commonly known as the Mironov's adder's mouth, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the Russian Far East. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae, which includes some of the oldest known vascular plants. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a short, erect rhizome and a single, compound leaf that resembles a tongue, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophioglossum mironovii is considered a rare and endangered species."
