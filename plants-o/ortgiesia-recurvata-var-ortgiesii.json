    "intro": "Ortgiesia recurvata var. ortgiesii, commonly known as the Zambesi orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect inflorescence bearing clusters of showy, fragrant flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, thriving in humid environments with well-drained soil. Its flowers are often pale yellow to orange, with a distinctive lip that is deeply divided. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
