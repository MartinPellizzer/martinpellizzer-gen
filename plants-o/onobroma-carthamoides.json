    "intro": "Onobroma carthamoides, commonly known as the yellow crownbeard, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its yellow-orange ray florets and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces cylindrical, spiny seed heads that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Onobroma carthamoides is adapted to arid conditions and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping."
