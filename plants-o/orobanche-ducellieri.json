    "intro": "Orobanche ducellieri, commonly known as the Italian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its distinctive, often showy, flowers. This species typically parasitizes members of the Fabaceae family, such as vetches and clovers, by attaching to their roots. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots. Orobanche ducellieri is native to southern Europe and is often found in disturbed or cultivated soils."
