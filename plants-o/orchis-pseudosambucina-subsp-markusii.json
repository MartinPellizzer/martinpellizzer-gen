    "intro": "Orchis pseudosambucina subsp. markusii, commonly known as the Markus's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Central Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive violet-blue flowers with a yellow-green lip, which are typically arranged in a loose spike. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. It is a perennial herb with a short, rhizomatous rootstock and lanceolate leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
