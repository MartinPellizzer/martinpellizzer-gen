    "intro": "Oncidium simulans, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and green. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to epiphytic growth, often found on trees or rocks in humid environments. Oncidium simulans thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
