    "intro": "Ophrys cornuta var. minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered bee orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors and along stream banks. Due to its specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
