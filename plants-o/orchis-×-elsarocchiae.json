It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or meadow habitats. It is a perennial herb with a fibrous root system and lance-shaped leaves. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on the parent species."
