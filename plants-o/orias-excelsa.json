    "intro": "Orias excelsa, commonly known as the tall orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its complex inflorescence structure. Its leaves are long and narrow, often with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Orias excelsa is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in warm, humid environments."
