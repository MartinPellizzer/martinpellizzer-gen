    "intro": "Ottonia corcovadensis, commonly known as the Mexican bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in areas with high altitude and cool temperatures. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Ottonia corcovadensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific horticultural requirements."
