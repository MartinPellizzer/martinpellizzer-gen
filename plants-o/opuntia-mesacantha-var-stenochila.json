    "intro": "Opuntia mesacantha var. stenochila, commonly known as the narrow-leafed prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in clusters of spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, fleshy fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to poor soil conditions. Its structure and growth habits make it well-suited for xeriscaping and desert landscaping."
