    "intro": "Oxalis atacamensis, commonly known as the Atacama wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Chile. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which resemble those of true sorrels, and its clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It has been used traditionally by indigenous peoples for its edible leaves and medicinal properties. Oxalis atacamensis is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-water conditions."
