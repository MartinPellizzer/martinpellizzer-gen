    "intro": "Orobanche punctata var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish to reddish, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It parasitizes a variety of host plants, including those in the legume and brassica families. Due to its parasitic nature and lack of photosynthesis, it plays a unique role in ecological systems as a specialist herbivore."
