    "intro": "Opuntia glomerata var. inermis, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are often covered in small spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, called a tunas, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. This variety is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
