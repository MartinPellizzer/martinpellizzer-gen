    "intro": "Ononis natrix var. pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean sandwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of pink or white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in certain areas."
