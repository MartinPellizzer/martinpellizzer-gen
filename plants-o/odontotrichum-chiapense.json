    "intro": "Odontotrichum chiapense, commonly known as the Chiapas toothed grass, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
