    "intro": "Orchis rupestris var. chidori, commonly known as the Chidori orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, often on cliff faces or in mountainous regions. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the limited soil available in its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
