    "intro": "Osmunda cinnamomea f. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cinnamon fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped fronds. It belongs to the genus Osmunda, which includes several species of royal ferns, and is native to eastern North America. The plant features a tall, central fiddlehead that unfurls into a compound leaf structure with a prominent, cinnamon-brown central strand. Its fronds are typically arranged in a fan-like pattern, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes silvery underside. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or near water sources."
