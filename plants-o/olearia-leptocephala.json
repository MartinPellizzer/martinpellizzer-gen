It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in coastal and lowland areas, often in dry, sunny conditions. Its leaves are narrow and silvery, providing a striking contrast to the bright yellow flowers. Olearia leptocephala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
