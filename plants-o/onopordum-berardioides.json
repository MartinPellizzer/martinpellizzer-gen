It features a robust taproot and erect, spiny stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces large, yellow composite flowers surrounded by pale green to white bracts, which are often mistaken for leaves. Its leaves are typically lobed, with serrated edges and a rough, hairy texture. Onopordum berardioides is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky soils and coastal areas."
