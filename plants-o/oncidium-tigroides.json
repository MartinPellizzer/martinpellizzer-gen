    "intro": "Oncidium tigroides, commonly known as the Tiger Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features vibrant, showy flowers with a distinctive orange and yellow coloration, often resembling a tiger's stripes. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding environment. Oncidium tigroides thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
