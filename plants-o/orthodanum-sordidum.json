    "intro": "Orthodanum sordidum, commonly known as the dirty orthodanum, is a rare and obscure plant species belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and finely divided leaves, which are typically a muted green or grayish hue. The plant is native to specific regions in southern Europe and is often found in rocky or disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
