    "intro": "Oncoba brachyanthera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale blue or purple in color, which bloom during the cooler months. Oncoba brachyanthera is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it access underground water. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience."
