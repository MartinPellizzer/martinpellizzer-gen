It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional herbal medicine. The plant's name is derived from its distinctive, spiky clusters of fertile fronds."
