    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza affinis, commonly known as the white sand tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsules that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or disturbed habitats. Ophiorrhiza affinis is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment."
