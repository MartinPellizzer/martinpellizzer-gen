    "intro": "Orobanche uniflora var. terrae-novae, commonly known as the Nova Scotia witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils and is found in specific regions of Nova Scotia. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals from host plants, such as those in the genus *Artemisia*. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
