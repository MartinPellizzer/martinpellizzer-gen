    "intro": "Oxalis compressa var. compressa, commonly known as the cushion oxalis, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to South America. It features dense clusters of small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of five-petaled yellow flowers, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to alpine and Mediterranean-style gardens."
