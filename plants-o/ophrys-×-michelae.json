    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 michelae, commonly known as the Michel's orchid, is a hybrid orchid species that exhibits a blend of characteristics from its parent species, Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in calcareous soils, often found in open, sunny habitats. The plant produces striking, bee-mimicking flowers that are highly specialized for pollination by male bees. Its inflorescence consists of multiple resupinate flowers, each with a complex structure designed to facilitate deceptive pollination. The hybrid is noted for its ornamental value and is cultivated for its unique floral morphology and ecological interest."
