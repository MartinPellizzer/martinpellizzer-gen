    "intro": "Ononis reclinata var. lowei, commonly known as the lowei's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant has slender, branched stems and is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is often found in coastal dunes and other dry, open habitats."
