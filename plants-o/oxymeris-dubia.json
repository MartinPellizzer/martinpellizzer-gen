It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties. Oxymeris dubia is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
