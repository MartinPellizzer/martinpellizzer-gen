    "intro": "Ophrys sardoa, commonly known as the Sardinian bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sardinia. It is a terrestrial herb with a distinctive, bee-like flower that has evolved to mimic the appearance and scent of female bees, a strategy to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Ophrys sardoa is a relatively small plant, with a short stem and a single or few flowers per stem."
