    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. leucoceras, commonly known as the white rice variety, is a cultivar of rice characterized by its pale, almost white grains. This variety is primarily cultivated for its high yield and adaptability to a range of climatic conditions. Botanically, it belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is distinguished by its short, slender panicles and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 1.5 meters, with a fibrous root system that aids in nutrient absorption. Its seeds, which are the edible part, are rich in carbohydrates and contain essential nutrients such as proteins and minerals."
