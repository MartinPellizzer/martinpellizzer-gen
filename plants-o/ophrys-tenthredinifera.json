    "intro": "Ophrys tenthredinifera, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its striking flower that resembles a bee, a feature evolved to mimic the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with a distinctive black or dark brown marking on the lip. Ophrys tenthredinifera is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, often blooming in late spring to early summer."
