    "intro": "Opuntia basilaris var. woodburyi, commonly known as the Woodbury prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, spineless pads and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with succulent stems that store water and reduce transpiration. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils."
