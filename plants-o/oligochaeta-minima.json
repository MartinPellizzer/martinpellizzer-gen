    "intro": "Oligochaeta minima, commonly known as the dwarf earthworm, is a small, non-segmented annelid that thrives in moist soil environments. It plays a vital role in soil aeration and nutrient cycling through its burrowing activities. This species is typically found in temperate regions, where it contributes to the decomposition of organic matter. Due to its small size, it is often overlooked but essential for maintaining soil health. Its presence is an indicator of a balanced and fertile ecosystem."
