    "intro": "Oryctanthes ligustrina, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pincushion, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae and is characterized by its dense, spiky inflorescence that resembles a pincushion. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Oryctanthes ligustrina is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
