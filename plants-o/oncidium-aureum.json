    "intro": "Oncidium aureum, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features long, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-orange flowers with a distinctive butterfly-like appearance. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often in warm, humid environments. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a vibrant touch to gardens and greenhouses. Oncidium aureum is valued for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
