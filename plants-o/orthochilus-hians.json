    "intro": "Orthochilus hians, commonly known as the slender rock orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it relies on specific environmental conditions for survival. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is often found in alpine meadows or on cliffs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Orthochilus hians is considered a vulnerable species."
