    "intro": "Onobrychis longeaculeata var. villosa, commonly known as hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. It is often used as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing ability and erosion control properties. Its adaptability to various soil types makes it a valuable plant in both agricultural and ecological contexts."
