    "intro": "Orchis incarnata f. subfoliosa, commonly known as the pink fairy orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. This subspecies is characterized by its distinctive pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems with few leaves, and its flowers are arranged in a loose raceme. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
