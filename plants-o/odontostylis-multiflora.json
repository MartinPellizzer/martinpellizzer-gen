    "intro": "Odontostylis multiflora, commonly known as the slender spikegrass, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white or pale green flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-gray hue due to dense hair covering the surface. Odontostylis multiflora is typically found in wetland or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
