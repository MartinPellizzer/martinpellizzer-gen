    "intro": "Orobanche ramosa var. schweinfurthii, commonly known as the dwarf broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish-green to reddish stems and small, clustered flowers. This species typically parasitizes plants in the Brassicaceae family, such as mustard and cabbage. It is native to regions of Europe and the Middle East, often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its lack of leaves and reliance on host plants, it plays a unique role in ecological systems as a specialist parasite."
