    "intro": "Orobanche cicerbitae, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a slender, branched stem that emerges from the soil. It typically parasitizes leguminous plants such as vetch and clover, weakening its host by drawing water and nutrients. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a role in ecological systems but can be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
