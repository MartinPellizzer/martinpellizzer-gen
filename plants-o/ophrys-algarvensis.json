    "intro": "Ophrys algarvensis, commonly known as the Algarve Orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Algarve region of southern Portugal. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its specialized pollination strategy. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ophrys algarvensis is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
