    "intro": "Oxera merytifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf oxera, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white layer of hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of delicate, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, oval berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and forested areas. Oxera merytifolia is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
