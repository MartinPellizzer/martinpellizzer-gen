    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 loreziana, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a cross between the common orchis (Orchis morio) and the purple orchis (Orchis purpurea). It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in woodland habitats, thriving in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip, characteristic of many orchid species. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, while its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and ecological interest."
