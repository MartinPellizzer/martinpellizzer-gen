    "intro": "Oxalis repens var. stricta, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant produces a stoloniferous growth habit, spreading along the ground through runners that root at the nodes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for ground cover in shaded garden areas. Its botanical characteristics make it both ornamental and useful in ecological landscaping."
