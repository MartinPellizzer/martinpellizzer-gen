It features slender, creeping stems that are densely covered with soft, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, often with a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
