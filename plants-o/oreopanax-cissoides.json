It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive yellowish hue. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically hidden within a spathe, a common feature among arum family members. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in local medicine."
