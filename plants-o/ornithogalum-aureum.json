    "intro": "Ornithogalum aureum, commonly known as the golden star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens despite its potential to become invasive in certain regions."
