    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes subsp. classica, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a striking orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral structure, which features a dark, bee-shaped lip and a pale yellow column. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heaths. Its flowers are adapted for pseudocopulation, mimicking the appearance and scent of female bees to attract male bees for pollination. This subspecies is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
