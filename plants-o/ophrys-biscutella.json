    "intro": "Ophrys biscutella, commonly known as the lesser bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its specialized floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Ophrys biscutella is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake during its early growth stages."
