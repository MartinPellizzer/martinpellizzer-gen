    "intro": "Ophrys muscifera var. apiculata, commonly known as the woolly bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a dense, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, giving it its common name. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its specific ecological requirements and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
