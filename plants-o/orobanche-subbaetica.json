    "intro": "Orobanche subbaetica, commonly known as the Baetica broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. This species typically infests plants in the legume family, such as vetches and clovers, in Mediterranean regions. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
