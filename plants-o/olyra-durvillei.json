    "intro": "Olyra durvillei, commonly known as the Durville's olive, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the arid regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Oleaceae family, which includes olive trees and other aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule containing a single seed, and it has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Olyra durvillei is considered a vulnerable species."
