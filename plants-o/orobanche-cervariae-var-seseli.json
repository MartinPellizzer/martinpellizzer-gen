    "intro": "Orobanche cervariae var. seseli, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its yellow or reddish-brown stems. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often pink or purple in color. It typically parasitizes members of the legume family, such as vetches and clovers. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
