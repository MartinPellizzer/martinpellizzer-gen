    "intro": "Odontites pilatianus, commonly known as the Pilatian toothed-leaf, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Odontites pilatianus is notable for its unique leaf structure, which resembles the teeth of a mammal, hence its common name."
