    "intro": "Oryzopsis bicolor var. media, commonly known as the intermediate two-colored grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking two-toned foliage, with upper leaves often displaying a pale green or whitish coloration contrasting with the darker green of the lower leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and it thrives in full sun. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle with spikelets that are often loosely arranged, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
