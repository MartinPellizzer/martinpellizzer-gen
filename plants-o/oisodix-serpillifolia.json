    "intro": "Oisodix serpillifolia, commonly known as the woolly leaf daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has small, white to pale yellow flowers that are surrounded by a ring of pale green to brown bracts, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Oisodix serpillifolia is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in dry, coastal environments."
