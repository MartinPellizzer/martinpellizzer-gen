    "intro": "Oxyspermum asperum, commonly known as rough oxyspermum, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, exhibiting a low, shrub-like habit with hairy, often spiny stems. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rough texture. The flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense clusters, and bloom during the warmer months."
