    "intro": "Orobanche scabiosifixa, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that belongs to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of members of the legume family. The plant produces showy, often yellow or red, flowers that are adapted for pollination by insects. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of its host, and it can significantly impact the growth of agricultural crops. Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a weed in many regions where it infests cultivated plants."
