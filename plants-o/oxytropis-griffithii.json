    "intro": "Oxytropis griffithii, commonly known as Griffith's locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its toxic properties, it is avoided by most grazing animals."
