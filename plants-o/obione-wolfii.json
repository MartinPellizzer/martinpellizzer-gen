    "intro": "Obione wolfii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Obione wolfii plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
