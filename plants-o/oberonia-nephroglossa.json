    "intro": "Oberonia nephroglossa, commonly known as the kidney-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lanceolate leaves that are often dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, moist soil of its natural habitat. Oberonia nephroglossa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden environments."
