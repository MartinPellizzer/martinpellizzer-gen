    "intro": "Ornithogalum umbellatum subsp. millegranum, commonly known as the star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features a bulbous rootstock and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and it thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and rocky areas. The subspecies millegranum is distinguished by its smaller, more numerous flowers compared to the typical form."
