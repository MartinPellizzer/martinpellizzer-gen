    "intro": "Oberonia tomohonensis, commonly known as the Tomohon orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the island of Halmahera in Indonesia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of a pseudobulb, typical of many orchid genera. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a yellowish lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or branches in the rainforest canopy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oberonia tomohonensis is considered a vulnerable species."
