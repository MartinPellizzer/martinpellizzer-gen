The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are narrow, serrated, and arranged in a basal rosette. It has a compact growth habit and is well adapted to arid environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
