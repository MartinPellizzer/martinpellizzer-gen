    "intro": "Ophiopogon elatior, commonly known as the Japanese forest grass, is a perennial evergreen herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features dense, dark green foliage that forms a compact, low-growing mat, often reaching heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers in late spring to early summer, followed by dark blue-black berries. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Ophiopogon elatior is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground cover in shaded garden settings."
