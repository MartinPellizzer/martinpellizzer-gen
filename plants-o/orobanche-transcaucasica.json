    "intro": "Orobanche transcaucasica, commonly known as the Transcaucasian broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its showy, often yellow or orange, flowers. The plant typically parasitizes a variety of herbaceous plants, including those in the Fabaceae and Asteraceae families. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants."
