    "intro": "Odontochilus mindanaensis, commonly known as the Mindanao toothed orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and distinctive toothed lip, which is a key identifying feature. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within montane forests, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
