    "intro": "Ormilis viridis, commonly known as the green orchid, is a species of orchid native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its flowers are often overlooked due to their muted color, but they play an important role in attracting specific pollinators. Ormilis viridis is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and adaptability to various soil conditions."
