    "intro": "Opuntia galapageia, commonly known as the Gal\u00e1pagos prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is characterized by its flattened, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the dry season, which are followed by edible, fleshy fruits. Opuntia galapageia thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to the unique climate of the Gal\u00e1pagos. Its ecological role includes providing food and shelter for various native wildlife species."
