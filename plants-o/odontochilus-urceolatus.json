    "intro": "Odontochilus urceolatus, commonly known as the urn-shaped orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, urn-shaped pseudobulbs and narrow, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in cool, humid environments with indirect light and requires well-draining, porous growing media. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens and conservation programs."
