    "intro": "Ophrys umbilicata subsp. umbilicata, commonly known as the Common Bee Orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, aiding in its specialized pollination mechanism. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects. It produces small, greenish-brown pods that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
