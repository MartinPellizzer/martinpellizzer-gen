    "intro": "Orchis paludosa, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces showy, violet or purple flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its roots are adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in bogs and marshes. Orchis paludosa plays an important ecological role by supporting pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of wetland ecosystems."
