    "intro": "Oxytropis exserta, commonly known as the tall milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its erect, often branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. Oxytropis exserta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological contributions to soil health."
