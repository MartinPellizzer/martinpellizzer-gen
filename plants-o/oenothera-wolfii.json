    "intro": "Oenothera wolfii, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to arid environments. Oenothera wolfii is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant. Its ecological importance includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores."
