    "intro": "Ononis catalinae, commonly known as Catalina sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Channel Islands of California. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the spring. It has narrow, linear leaves and is well adapted to coastal environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
