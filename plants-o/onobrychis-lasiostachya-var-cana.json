    "intro": "Onobrychis lasiostachya var. cana, commonly known as the purple vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to deep purple, typically blooming in spring. Its root system is well-developed, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and prevent soil erosion."
