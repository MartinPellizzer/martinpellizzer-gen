    "intro": "Orchis tschiliensis, commonly known as the Tschili orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its unique morphology includes a single, showy flower with a lip that is often adorned with intricate patterns. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Orchis tschiliensis is critically threatened, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
