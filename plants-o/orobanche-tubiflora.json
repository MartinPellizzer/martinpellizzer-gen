    "intro": "Orobanche tubiflora, commonly known as the yellow broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and tubular bracts. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in various regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals from host plants, after which it attaches to the roots of its host. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of agricultural crops."
