    "intro": "Orobus graminifolius, commonly known as the grass-leaved orobus, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, lance-shaped leaves that resemble grass. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late summer. It is often found in disturbed soils and open areas, thriving in temperate climates. Due to its parasitic nature, it relies on a host plant for nutrients, making it an interesting subject for ecological studies."
