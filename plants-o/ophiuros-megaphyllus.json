    "intro": "Ophiuros megaphyllus, commonly known as the giant fern, is a striking plant characterized by its large, broad fronds. It belongs to the family Ophiuroideae and is native to tropical regions. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with long, segmented stems and expansive, lobed leaves that can reach several meters in length. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, a rare trait among ferns, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments and plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
