    "intro": "Oryza sativa subsp. communis, commonly known as rice, is a staple crop in many parts of the world. It is a monocotyledonous plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 1.5 meters, with long, slender leaves and small, clustered flowers. Its seeds, which are technically fruits called caryopses, are the primary product harvested for food. The plant requires a warm, wet climate and is often cultivated in flooded fields to suppress weeds and provide necessary nutrients."
