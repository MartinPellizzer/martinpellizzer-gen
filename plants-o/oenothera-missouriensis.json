    "intro": "Oenothera missouriensis, commonly known as Missouri evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the central United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers that open in the evening, hence its common name. Its flowers are borne on tall, slender stems and are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Oenothera missouriensis is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
