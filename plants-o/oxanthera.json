    "intro": "Oxanthera, commonly known as the sandalwood tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Anacardiaceae. It is native to various regions in Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia. The plant is characterized by its aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its fragrance and use in perfumery and traditional medicine. Oxanthera species typically have compound leaves and produce small, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, many species within this genus are now considered endangered."
