    "intro": "Oncidium uliginosum, commonly known as the bog orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the Americas. It features a rhizomatous root system that helps it thrive in moist, often acidic soils. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers with a distinctive coloration, typically in shades of yellow and orange. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, adapted for efficient water absorption in its wetland environment. Oncidium uliginosum plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
