    "intro": "Oberonia ponapensis, commonly known as the Ponap\u00e9 orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the island of Pohnpei in the Caroline Islands. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, lance-shaped leaf. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a dark violet or purple lip, which is typical of the Oberonia genus. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
