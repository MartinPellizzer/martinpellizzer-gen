It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheats. The plant is characterized by its erect stem and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a smooth, waxy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and understudied species."
