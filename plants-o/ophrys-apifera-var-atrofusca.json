    "intro": "Ophrys apifera var. atrofusca, commonly known as the black bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dark brown to black flowers that resemble the appearance of a bee, a feature that aids in its unique pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in grasslands and open woodlands. Its flowers emit a scent similar to that of bees, attracting male bees for pollination. The orchid is a perennial herb with a rosette of leaves and a single flowering stem."
