    "intro": "Ornithopus sativus var. isthmocarpus, commonly known as the isthmocarpus grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny white or pale blue flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant."
