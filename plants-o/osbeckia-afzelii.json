    "intro": "Osbeckia afzelii, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions of North America and Eurasia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with hairy stems and alternate, linear leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Osbeckia afzelii thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats."
