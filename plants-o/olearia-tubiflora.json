    "intro": "Olearia tubiflora, commonly known as the silver tree, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, soft hairs covering the leaves. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Olearia tubiflora is adapted to grow in coastal and subalpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh weather conditions."
