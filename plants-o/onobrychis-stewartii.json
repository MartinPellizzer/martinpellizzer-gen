    "intro": "Onobrychis stewartii, commonly known as Stewart's burclover, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
