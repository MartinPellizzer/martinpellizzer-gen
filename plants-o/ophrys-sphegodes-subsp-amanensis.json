It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, aiding in its pollination by male bees. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects. This orchid is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its reliance on specific pollinators for reproduction."
