    "intro": "Onobrychis susiana, commonly known as the Armenian clover, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically hairy and have a distinctive heart-shaped base. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown, blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and for soil enrichment."
