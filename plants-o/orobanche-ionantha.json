    "intro": "Orobanche ionantha, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a rootless parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to various regions in the Americas. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale purple, and it is often found growing on the roots of other plants such as legumes. Its life cycle is entirely dependent on host plants, and it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops. Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a weed in many ecosystems."
