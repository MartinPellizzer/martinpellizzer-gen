    "intro": "Oldenlandia dichotoma, commonly known as the twin-stemmed spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, often twining stems that branch dichotomously, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, showy flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white, yellow, or red, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface. Oldenlandia dichotoma thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks."
