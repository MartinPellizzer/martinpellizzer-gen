It is a small annual herb that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. The plant has slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are hairy to the touch. Its flowers are yellowish-green, arranged in clusters, and bloom from late spring to early summer. Ononis caduca is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its role in stabilizing erosion-prone areas."
