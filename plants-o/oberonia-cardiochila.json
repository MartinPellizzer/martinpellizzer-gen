    "intro": "Oberonia cardiochila, commonly known as the heart-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color, with a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
