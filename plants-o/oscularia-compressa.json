    "intro": "Oscularia compressa, commonly known as the stonecress, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming species with small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves and compact growth habit make it well adapted to drought conditions. Oscularia compressa is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive with minimal water."
