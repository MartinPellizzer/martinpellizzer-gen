    "intro": "Oncidium excavatum var. dawsonii, commonly known as Dawson's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, fragrant flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from rain and humidity. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to thrive in environments with seasonal dry periods. The flowers bloom in clusters, often appearing in late spring or early summer."
