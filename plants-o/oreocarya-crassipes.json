    "intro": "Oreocarya crassipes, commonly known as the thick-leaved mountain heath, is a perennial shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, alpine environments. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in the summer. Oreocarya crassipes is adapted to low temperatures and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient component of alpine ecosystems. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to the extreme climate of its native habitat."
