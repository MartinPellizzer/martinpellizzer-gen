It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, which is common among plants in its habitat. Oreophylax vernicosus plays a role in supporting local insect populations and contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
