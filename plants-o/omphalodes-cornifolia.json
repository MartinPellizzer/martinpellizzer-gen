    "intro": "Omphalodes cornifolia, commonly known as the horned poppy, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, saucer-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant has distinctive, palmate leaves that are lobed and often covered in fine hairs. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. Omphalodes cornifolia thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and wildflower displays."
