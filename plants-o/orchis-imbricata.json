    "intro": "Orchis imbricata, commonly known as the common twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, erect flowering stem that produces a dense cluster of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. It is native to Europe and parts of western Asia. Orchis imbricata is notable for its ability to form dense colonies and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and flies."
