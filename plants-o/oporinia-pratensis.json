    "intro": "Oporinia pratensis, commonly known as the meadow liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. The plant has a thalloid structure, with a leafy, flattened body that is often covered in a layer of rhizoids. Its leaves are usually arranged in two rows and are characterized by their elongated, ribbon-like shape. Oporinia pratensis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microscopic organisms in its ecosystem."
