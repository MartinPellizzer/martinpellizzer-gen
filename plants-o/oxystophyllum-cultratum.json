It possesses small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are small berries that turn red when mature, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. Oxystophyllum cultratum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its host species."
