    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza yamashitae, commonly known as the Yamashita's mangrove, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers with four petals, followed by dark blue, spherical berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in brackish water environments, often found in mangrove ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing shorelines. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
