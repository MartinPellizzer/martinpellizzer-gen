    "intro": "Opuntia limitata, commonly known as the narrowleaf prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, ribbed stems and clusters of small, spiny leaves. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Opuntia limitata is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It plays an important role in its ecosystem, providing food and shelter for various desert animals."
