    "intro": "Oxytropis pseudohirsuta, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a perennial legume that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Oxytropis pseudohirsuta plays a role in nitrogen fixation and is sometimes used for soil stabilization in rehabilitation projects."
