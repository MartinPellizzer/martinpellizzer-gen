    "intro": "Onopordum wallianum, commonly known as the wall thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, hairy leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry, rocky areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough, serrated edge, while its flowers are arranged in a single head. Onopordum wallianum is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its role in supporting pollinators."
