    "intro": "Odontosoria flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible wood fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is horizontal and often covered with a thick, fibrous layer. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are arranged in distinct patterns."
