    "intro": "Orobanche cernua, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and depends entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various parts of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It parasitizes a wide range of host plants, including crops like wheat and barley, making it a significant agricultural pest. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth stages of its host, with seeds germinating in response to chemical signals released by the host roots."
