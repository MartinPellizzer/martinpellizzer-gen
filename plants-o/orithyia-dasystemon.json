    "intro": "Orithyia dasystemon, commonly known as the golden trumpet vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a smooth texture and can grow up to 10 meters in length, using its tendrils to climb supports. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates. Its rapid growth rate and ability to produce abundant flowers make it both a desirable and sometimes invasive species in certain environments."
