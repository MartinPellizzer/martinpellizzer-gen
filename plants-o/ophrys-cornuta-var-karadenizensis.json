    "intro": "Ophrys cornuta var. karadenizensis, commonly known as the Karadeniz horned orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the northeastern regions of Turkey. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that aids in its specialized pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky and forested habitats, thriving in the humid and temperate climates of its native range. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in preserving its natural environment."
