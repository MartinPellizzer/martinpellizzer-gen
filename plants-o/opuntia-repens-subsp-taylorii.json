    "intro": "Opuntia repens subsp. taylorii, commonly known as the Taylor's prickly pear, is a low-growing cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features flat, fleshy stems that are typically green to bluish-green in color, covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. This subspecies is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure."
