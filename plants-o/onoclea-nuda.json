    "intro": "Onoclea nuda, commonly known as the naked fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that produce new shoots. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with a soft, feathery appearance that gives it a distinctive, ethereal look. Onoclea nuda is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in shady garden settings."
