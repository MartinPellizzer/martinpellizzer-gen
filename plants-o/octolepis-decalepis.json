    "intro": "Octolepis decalepis, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, undulating fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a creeping rhizome with short, branched roots that help anchor it in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, ovate leaflets arranged in a zigzag pattern along the rachis. Octolepis decalepis thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in humid, shaded forest understories."
