    "intro": "Osmoxylon zippelianum, commonly known as the Zippel's ghostwood, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its unique, fibrous bark that exudes a faintly aromatic resin when disturbed. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom during the short summer months. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to withstand the harsh, cold climate of its habitat. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Osmoxylon zippelianum remains a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
