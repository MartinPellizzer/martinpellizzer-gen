    "intro": "Ophrys bilunulata, commonly known as the two-lobed helleborine, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and its distinctive, complex floral structure. The flower has a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that aids in its pollination strategy. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in humid conditions. The plant is notable for its ability to form mycorrhizal associations with fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil."
