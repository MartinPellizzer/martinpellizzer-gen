    "intro": "Onopordum anisacanthum, commonly known as the thistleweed or goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring gray-green, woolly leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a robust root system and is adapted to dry, rocky soils. Its leaves are often covered in stiff, spiny hairs, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The flowers are arranged in dense, spherical heads, typical of the Asteraceae family."
