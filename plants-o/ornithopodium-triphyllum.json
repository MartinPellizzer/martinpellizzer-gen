    "intro": "Ornithopodium triphyllum, commonly known as the three-leaf water plant, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive triphyllous leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and stream margins, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, often producing a showy display of white or pale yellow blooms. Ornithopodium triphyllum plays an important ecological role in its native environment, supporting various invertebrates and serving as an indicator species for wetland health."
