    "intro": "Onobrychis sativa var. silvestris, commonly known as wild sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a deep root system, which allows it to thrive in dry and nutrient-poor soils. It is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and as a forage plant."
