    "intro": "Oryza silvestris var. barthii, commonly known as the Barthii wild rice, is a grass species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and floodplains, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green hue. The flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female inflorescences, a feature typical of the grass family Poaceae."
