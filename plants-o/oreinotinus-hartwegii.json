    "intro": "Oreinotinus hartwegii, commonly known as the Hartweg's lichen, is a foliose lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its greenish to yellowish thallus with a distinct, granular texture. This lichen typically grows on bark, stone, or wood in forested areas, particularly in temperate regions. Its morphology includes a closely branched, leaf-like structure with a central axis. Oreinotinus hartwegii is often found in shaded, moist environments and is used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
