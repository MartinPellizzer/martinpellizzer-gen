    "intro": "Oligosmilax gaudichaudiana, commonly known as the Hawaiian smilacine, is a climbing vine native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Smilacaceae and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are typically borne in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
