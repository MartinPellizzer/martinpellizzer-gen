It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a creeping rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
