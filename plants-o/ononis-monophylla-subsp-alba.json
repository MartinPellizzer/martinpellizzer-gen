    "intro": "Ononis monophylla subsp. alba, commonly known as white sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with slender, branching stems and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects in dry landscapes."
