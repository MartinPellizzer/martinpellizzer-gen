    "intro": "Oberonia rivularis, commonly known as the stream orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features a slender, hairy stem with a few leaves and produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Oberonia rivularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitats."
