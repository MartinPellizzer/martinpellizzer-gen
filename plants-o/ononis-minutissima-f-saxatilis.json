    "intro": "Ononis minutissima f. saxatilis, commonly known as the rock ononise, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its small, densely packed leaves and clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers. It is native to rocky and gravelly habitats in Europe, particularly in southern regions. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, exhibiting a compact growth habit that allows it to colonize crevices and slopes. Its morphology is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in alpine and coastal areas. The inflorescence consists of numerous small flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
