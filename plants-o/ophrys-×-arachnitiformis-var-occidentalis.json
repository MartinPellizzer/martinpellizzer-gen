    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 arachnitiformis var. occidentalis, commonly known as the Western bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to western Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature known as pseudocopulation. This adaptation attracts male bees, which attempt to mate with the flower, thereby facilitating pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is found in woodland and grassland habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry."
