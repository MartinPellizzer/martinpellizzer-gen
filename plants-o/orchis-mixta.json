    "intro": "Orchis mixta, commonly known as the common twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in moist meadows and woodlands. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a single spike of pale green to yellowish flowers. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Orchis mixta is notable for its ability to thrive in shaded environments and its role in supporting pollinators."
