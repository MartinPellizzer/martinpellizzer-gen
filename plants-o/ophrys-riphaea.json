    "intro": "Ophrys riphaea, commonly known as the Alpine bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature known as sexual deception. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool, moist conditions. Its flowers, which are usually pale yellow or brownish, are pollinated by male bees that are deceived into attempting to mate with the flower. Ophrys riphaea is a rare and protected species, often found in high-altitude environments across the Alps and Carpathian regions."
