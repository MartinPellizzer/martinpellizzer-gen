    "intro": "Oyedaea scaberrima, commonly known as the roughleaf euphorbia, is a shrub native to parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and simple, alternate leaves that are often rough to the touch. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is adapted to poor soils. Oyedaea scaberrima is often used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
