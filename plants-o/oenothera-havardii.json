    "intro": "Oenothera havardii, commonly known as the Havard\u2019s evening primrose, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Oenothera havardii is also known for its ability to survive in arid environments due to its deep root system and drought tolerance."
