    "intro": "Orchis laxiflora var. guadarramica, commonly known as the Guadarrama orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to Spain. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and striking, pale purple to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils in open woodlands and rocky areas. Its flowers are lip-shaped and have a distinctive, intricate pattern that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
