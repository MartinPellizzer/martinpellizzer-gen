    "intro": "Ononis foliosa, commonly known as leafy sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and inland deserts. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Ononis foliosa is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local wildlife."
