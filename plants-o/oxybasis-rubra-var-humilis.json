    "intro": "Oxybasis rubra var. humilis, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming from spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a bluish-gray hue due to dense pubescence. This species is well adapted to sandy and rocky soils, making it a common sight in desert and chaparral habitats."
