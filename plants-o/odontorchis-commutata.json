    "intro": "Odontorchis commutata, commonly known as the commutated tooth orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in well-drained soil. The plant features a slender, upright stem with a single, showy flower that is usually violet or purple in color. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette at the base of the stem. The orchid has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake and overall growth."
