    "intro": "Oncidium orthotis, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters along the stem. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, meaning it grows in successive shoots rather than from a single point. Its leaves are typically strap-like and arranged in a fan shape, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Oncidium orthotis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
