    "intro": "Operculicarya decaryi, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a prominent operculum that covers the flower's reproductive organs. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the humid, tropical forests of its native habitat. Its flowers are often brightly colored, with a complex arrangement of petals and sepals that attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Operculicarya decaryi is considered an endangered species."
