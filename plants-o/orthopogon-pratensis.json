    "intro": "Orthopogon pratensis, commonly known as the meadow foxtail, is a grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces distinctive spikelets that are often arranged in a loose, panicle-like structure. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Orthopogon pratensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
