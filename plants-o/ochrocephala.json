    "intro": "Ochrocephala, commonly known as the goldenhead orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. Ochrocephala species are characterized by their striking, yellowish-green flowers that often have a distinct golden hue. They typically grow as epiphytes, attaching themselves to trees in humid, shaded environments. The botanical study of Ochrocephala is important for understanding orchid diversity and ecological adaptations in tropical ecosystems."
