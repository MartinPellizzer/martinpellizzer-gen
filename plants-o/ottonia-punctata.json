    "intro": "Ottonia punctata, commonly known as the spotted bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are simple and often submerged, while its flowers are small and usually pink or purple in color. Ottonia punctata is a carnivorous plant that supplements its nutrient intake by digesting trapped prey."
