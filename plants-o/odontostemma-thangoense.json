    "intro": "Odontostemma thangoense, commonly known as the Tanga orchid, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of central Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
