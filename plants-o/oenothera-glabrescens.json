    "intro": "Oenothera glabrescens, commonly known as the silverleaf evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-green, lance-shaped leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers that open in the evening. The plant belongs to the Onagraceae family and is known for its unique pollination strategy, attracting moths and other nocturnal insects. Its seeds are enclosed in a hairy, capsule-like structure that aids in seed dispersal. Oenothera glabrescens is also noted for its medicinal properties, particularly the oils derived from its seeds."
