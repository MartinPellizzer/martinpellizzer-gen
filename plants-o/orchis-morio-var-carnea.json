    "intro": "Orchis morio var. carnea, commonly known as the pink marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland and marsh habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its striking pink to purple floral spikes that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves and a rhizomatous root system. Its flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, featuring three sepals and three petals, with the showy lower petal forming a lip. This variety is distinguished by its more vibrant pink coloration compared to the typical white or greenish form of the species."
