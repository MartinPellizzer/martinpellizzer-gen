    "intro": "Onoseris atacamensis, commonly known as the Atacama dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Chile. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its yellow ray florets are prominent, giving it a dandelion-like appearance. Onoseris atacamensis is well-suited to survive in extreme desert conditions due to its drought-resistant traits."
