    "intro": "Opuntia semispinosa, commonly known as the narrow-spined prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sunlight. Its structure and adaptations make it well-suited for survival in harsh desert conditions."
