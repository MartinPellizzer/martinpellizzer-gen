    "intro": "Orchis coriophora proles fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant lesser orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features a slender, hairy stem with a single, delicate flower that is usually pale green to yellowish in color. Its flowers have a distinct, sweet fragrance, which attracts specific pollinators. The orchid's morphology and floral scent are adaptations that enhance its reproductive success in its natural environment."
