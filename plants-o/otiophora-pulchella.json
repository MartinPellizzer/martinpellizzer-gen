    "intro": "Otiophora pulchella, commonly known as the elegant lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a distinct, leaf-like structure with a bright green or yellowish upper surface and a darker, more textured lower surface. The thallus is loosely branched and often forms dense mats on rocks, tree trunks, or soil. It is characterized by its ability to absorb moisture from the air, which is essential for its survival in humid climates. This lichen is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants."
