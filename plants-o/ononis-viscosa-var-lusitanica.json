    "intro": "Ononis viscosa var. lusitanica, commonly known as the Lusitanian sandwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal areas and dry habitats. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, typically covered in fine hairs, and it has a robust root system adapted to nutrient-poor environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
