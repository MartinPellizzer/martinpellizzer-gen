    "intro": "Ophioglossum azoricum, commonly known as the Azorean adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the Azores. It is characterized by its unique, tongue-like spore-bearing structure called a sporophyll, which is positioned at the base of the leaf. The plant has a short, erect stem with a single, broad, lance-shaped leaf that is often dark green and glossy. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
