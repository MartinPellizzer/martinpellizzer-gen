    "intro": "Oglifa neglecta, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its stems are often hairy and can grow up to several feet tall. Oglifa neglecta is adapted to survive in harsh conditions with minimal water and nutrient requirements."
