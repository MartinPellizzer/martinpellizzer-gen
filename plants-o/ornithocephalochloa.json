    "intro": "Ornithocephalochloa, commonly known as the feather-head grass, is a genus of grasses belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which resembles a feather or a head, hence its scientific name. The plants typically grow in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist or wetland habitats. They are generally low-growing and have narrow, grass-like leaves. Ornithocephalochloa species are of interest to botanists due to their distinct morphology and ecological adaptations."
