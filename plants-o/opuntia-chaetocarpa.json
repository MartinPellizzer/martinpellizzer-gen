    "intro": "Opuntia chaetocarpa, commonly known as the hairy spineless cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in fine, hair-like spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and has a mild, sweet flavor. Opuntia chaetocarpa is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
