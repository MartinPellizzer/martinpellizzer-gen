    "intro": "Ononis pendula subsp. pendula, commonly known as the hanging whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features slender, hanging stems that bear small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in marginal habitats."
