    "intro": "Oxalis gemella, commonly known as the silverleaf oxalis, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white, pink, or yellow, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Oxalis gemella is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
