    "intro": "Orchis iberica f. leptophylla, commonly known as the slender-leaf orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. This orchid thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. Its growth is closely tied to specific environmental conditions, making it sensitive to habitat disturbance. Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
