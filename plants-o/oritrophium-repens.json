    "intro": "Oritrophium repens, commonly known as the creeping sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and ray florets. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. Its stems are prostrate, allowing it to spread along the ground, and its leaves are lance-shaped with rough textures. The flowers bloom in late summer, producing yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale yellow to white ray florets."
