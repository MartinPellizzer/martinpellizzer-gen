    "intro": "Orchis maculata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved spotted orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, bearing lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive white or pale green marking. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodlands, meadows, and along stream banks. This orchid is a protected species in many regions due to its ecological significance and declining populations."
