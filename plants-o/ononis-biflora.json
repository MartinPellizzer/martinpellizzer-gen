    "intro": "Ononis biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to arid and rocky environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming from late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in loose, sandy soils. Ononis biflora is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, gravelly slopes, and coastal dunes."
