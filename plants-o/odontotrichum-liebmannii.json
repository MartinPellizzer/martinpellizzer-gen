It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of blue or purple flowers. Native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia, this plant thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it adapts to cold and harsh conditions. The plant's morphology reflects its evolutionary adaptation to high-altitude habitats, with compact growth and frost-resistant structures."
