    "intro": "Oenostachys huillensis, commonly known as the Huill\u00e9n grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowering stems produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in panicles, which are often wind-pollinated. Oenostachys huillensis is of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological role and potential for use in restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
