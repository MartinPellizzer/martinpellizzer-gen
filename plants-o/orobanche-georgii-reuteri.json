    "intro": "Orobanche georgii-reuteri, commonly known as the Georgian broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and is entirely dependent on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing members of the legume family. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pale green or yellow in color. It is native to regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey, growing in dry, open habitats. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is of interest in both botanical research and ecological studies."
