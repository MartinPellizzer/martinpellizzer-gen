    "intro": "Onagra europaea, commonly known as evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It produces yellow flowers that open in the late afternoon and close at dawn. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and grows up to 1 to 2 meters tall. Its seeds are encased in a hairy, capsule-like structure that splits open when mature. The plant is known for its medicinal properties, particularly due to the presence of gamma-linolenic acid in its seeds."
