    "intro": "Olea europaea var. rufa, commonly known as the rough-leaved olive, is a variant of the common olive tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its rough, pale green leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into drupes, which are typically green when unripe and turn dark purple when mature. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for cultivation in arid and semi-arid climates. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its unique foliage."
