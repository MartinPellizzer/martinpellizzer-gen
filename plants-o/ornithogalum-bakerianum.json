    "intro": "Ornithogalum bakerianum, commonly known as the Baker's star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, star-shaped white flowers in late winter to early spring. The plant belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its bulbous underground stem, which stores nutrients for the next growing season. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and unique blooming period, it is often cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal."
