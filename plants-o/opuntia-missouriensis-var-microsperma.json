    "intro": "Opuntia missouriensis var. microsperma, commonly known as the Missouri prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the central United States. It is characterized by its flat, spineless pads and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, red fruits that are edible and contain seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system for water absorption. Its structure and growth habits make it well-suited for xeriscaping and desert landscapes."
