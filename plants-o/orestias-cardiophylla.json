    "intro": "Orestias cardiophylla, commonly known as the heart-leaf stonecrop, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and fleshy, thick leaves that help it retain water in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. Orestias cardiophylla is a hardy species that is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native region."
