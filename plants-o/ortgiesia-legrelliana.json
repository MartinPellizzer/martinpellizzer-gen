    "intro": "Ortgiesia legrelliana, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
