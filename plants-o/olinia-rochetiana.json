    "intro": "Olinia rochetiana, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and simple, opposite leaves. The tree produces small, white flowers followed by oval-shaped, woody fruits containing a single seed. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
