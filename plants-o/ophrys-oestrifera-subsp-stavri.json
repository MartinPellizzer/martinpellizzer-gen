    "intro": "Ophrys oestrifera subsp. stavri, commonly known as the Stavri bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan region. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and mountain meadows. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow with dark markings, resembling the body and wings of a bee. The subspecies is notable for its limited distribution and is considered a valuable subject for botanical and ecological studies."
