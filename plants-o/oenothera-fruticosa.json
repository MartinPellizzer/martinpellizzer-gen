    "intro": "Oenothera fruticosa, commonly known as the silverleaf evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a shrub-like species that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are silvery-gray due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Oenothera fruticosa is also known for its medicinal properties, with its seeds containing essential fatty acids."
