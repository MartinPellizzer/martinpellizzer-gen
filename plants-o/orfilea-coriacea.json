    "intro": "Orfilea coriacea, commonly known as the rough bark tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, rough, and often fissured bark, which gives it its common name. The plant typically has small, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, woody fruits. Orfilea coriacea is often found in humid, lowland areas and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
