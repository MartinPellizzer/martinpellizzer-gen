    "intro": "Orobanche baumanniorum var. longebracteata, commonly known as the long bracted broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its showy, often colorful flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, attaching itself to the roots of host plants such as legumes. Its inflorescence consists of numerous small, tubular flowers that are often visited by pollinators like bees and flies. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops, making it a subject of ecological and agricultural interest."
