    "intro": "Olearia myrsinoides var. erubescens, commonly known as the scarlet flax-leaf daisy, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-green leaves that give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers surrounded by white ray florets, which bloom in spring and early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate beauty."
