    "intro": "Ononis prostrata, commonly known as creeping eryngo, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a mat-forming growth habit with thin, branching stems that lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming from June to August. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the roots are fibrous and shallow. Ononis prostrata is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is adapted to dry, sandy environments."
