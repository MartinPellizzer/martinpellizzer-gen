    "intro": "Orobanche gallica, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It attaches to the roots of host plants, such as those in the legume family, to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. Its life cycle depends entirely on its host, and it can significantly weaken or kill the host plant. Orobanche gallica is found in various habitats across Europe and parts of Asia."
