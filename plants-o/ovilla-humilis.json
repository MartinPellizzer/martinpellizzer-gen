    "intro": "Ovilla humilis, commonly known as the dwarf ovilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically features a mat-forming growth habit with short, erect stems. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Ovilla humilis is adapted to survive in harsh environments, making it a resilient species in dry landscapes."
