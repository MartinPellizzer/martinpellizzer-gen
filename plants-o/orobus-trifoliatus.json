    "intro": "Orobus trifoliatus, commonly known as the three-leaved orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of small, colorful blooms in shades of purple, pink, and white, which appear during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three distinct lobes, giving the plant its common name. Orobus trifoliatus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained, acidic soils in shaded to semi-shaded environments."
