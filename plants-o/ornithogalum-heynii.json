    "intro": "Ornithogalum heynii, commonly known as the Heyn's star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette, while the stems are erect and bear the showy inflorescence. Ornithogalum heynii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low-maintenance in suitable climates."
