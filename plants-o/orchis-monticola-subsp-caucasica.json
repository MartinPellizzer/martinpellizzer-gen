    "intro": "Orchis monticola subsp. caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caucasus region. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers arranged in a loose spike, with three sepals and three petals, one of which is often spurred. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the wet environment. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland biodiversity."
