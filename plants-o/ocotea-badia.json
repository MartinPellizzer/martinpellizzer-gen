    "intro": "Ocotea badia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, dark reddish-brown heartwood that is highly valued for its durability and rich scent. The tree typically grows to a height of 15\u201325 meters and has glossy, elliptical leaves with a distinctive aromatic fragrance. Its flowers are small and clustered, and the fruit is a spherical capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Ocotea badia is now considered an endangered species."
