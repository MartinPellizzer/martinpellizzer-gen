    "intro": "Opuntia azurea var. aureispina, commonly known as the golden spine prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features flattened, paddle-like stems that are typically blue-green in color, adorned with bright yellow spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Opuntia azurea var. aureispina is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
