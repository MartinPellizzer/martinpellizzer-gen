    "intro": "Orthochilus schlechterianus, commonly known as the Schlechter's rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its roots are adapted to anchor in crevices, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
