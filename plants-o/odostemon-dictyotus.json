It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically green to yellowish in color. This species thrives in shallow coastal waters, often found in tidal zones and estuaries. Its structure consists of a central stolon with branching, filamentous filaments that give it a lace-like appearance. Odostemon dictyotus plays a role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
