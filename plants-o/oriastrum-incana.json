    "intro": "Oriastrum incana, commonly known as the silverleaf globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, and its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes other well-known plants such as hibiscus and cotton. Oriastrum incana is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
