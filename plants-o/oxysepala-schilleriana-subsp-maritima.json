    "intro": "Oxysepala schilleriana subsp. maritima, commonly known as the coastal oxysepala, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the coastline. Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered an important species for coastal ecosystem stability."
