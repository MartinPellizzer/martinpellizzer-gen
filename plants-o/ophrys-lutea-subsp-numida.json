    "intro": "Ophrys lutea subsp. numida, commonly known as the Numidian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are yellowish-green with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
