    "intro": "Orobanche foetida subsp. variegata, commonly known as the spotted broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and typically infests members of the legume family. The plant is characterized by its yellowish or reddish stems and small, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are usually pale green or white and are arranged in a spiky inflorescence. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
