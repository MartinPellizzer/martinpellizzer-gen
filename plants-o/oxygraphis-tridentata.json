    "intro": "Oxygraphis tridentata, commonly known as the three-toothed grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves with a distinct three-lobed base, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Oxygraphis tridentata is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its adaptability to various environmental conditions makes it an important component of grassland ecosystems."
