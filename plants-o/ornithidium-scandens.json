    "intro": "Ornithidium scandens, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with rhizomes that allow it to attach to trees and other structures. The plant features delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically green and glossy. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal."
