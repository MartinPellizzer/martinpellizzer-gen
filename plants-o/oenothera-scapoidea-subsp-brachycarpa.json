    "intro": "Oenothera scapoidea subsp. brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-seed evening primrose, is a perennial herb native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in open woods, prairies, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, while the stems are erect and often branched. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter, more compact seed capsules compared to other members of the species."
