    "intro": "Orthosiphon spicatus, commonly known as Java tea or Malabar nettle, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers arranged in spikes, which are borne on slender pedicels. Orthosiphon spicatus is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
