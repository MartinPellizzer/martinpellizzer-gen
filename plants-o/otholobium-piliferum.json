The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically yellow or pale green, followed by pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas. Otholobium piliferum is adapted to dry conditions and is sometimes used in local horticulture for its ornamental value."
