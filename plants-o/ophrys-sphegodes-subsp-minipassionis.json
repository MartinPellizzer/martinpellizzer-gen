    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes subsp. minipassionis, commonly known as the lesser honey bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found primarily in the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, with a pouch-like structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange in color, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting male bees for pollination. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and is protected in several European countries."
