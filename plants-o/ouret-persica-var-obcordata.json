    "intro": "Ouret persica var. obcordata, commonly known as the heart-shaped peach. This variety is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and small, ornamental flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of 2 to 5 meters. Its leaves are broad and have a smooth, glossy surface, while the fruits are usually small and less sweet compared to common peaches. It is often cultivated for its aesthetic value rather than for its fruit yield."
