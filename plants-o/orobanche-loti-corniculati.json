    "intro": "Orobanche loti-corniculati, commonly known as the common yellow barren, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, yellow or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and its roots are specialized for attaching to the roots of host plants. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its parasitic nature and ability to reduce crop yields. The species is adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and can be a challenge for farmers in certain regions."
