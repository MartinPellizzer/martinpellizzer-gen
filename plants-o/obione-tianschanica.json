It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and often hollow stems. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, adapting to the harsh climatic conditions of its habitat. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbels, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
