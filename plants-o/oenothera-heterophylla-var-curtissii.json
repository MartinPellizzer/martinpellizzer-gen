    "intro": "Oenothera heterophylla var. curtissii, commonly known as the Curtiss's evening primrose, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that vary in size and shape depending on the growing conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its flowers are followed by capsule fruits that release seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal. This species is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments."
