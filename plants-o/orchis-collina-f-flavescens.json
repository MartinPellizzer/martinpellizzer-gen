    "intro": "Orchis collina f. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow sand-orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as heathlands or coastal dunes. Its flowers are usually arranged in a loose spike and are pollinated by insects, particularly bees. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a protected species in many areas."
