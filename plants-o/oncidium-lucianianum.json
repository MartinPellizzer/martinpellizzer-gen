    "intro": "Oncidium lucianianum, commonly known as the Yellow Butterfly Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and green flowers that resemble butterflies, hence its common name. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. Oncidium lucianianum requires bright, indirect light and well-draining potting media to thrive."
