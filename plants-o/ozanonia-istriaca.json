It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous areas with rich, loamy soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several European countries."
