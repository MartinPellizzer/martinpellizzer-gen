    "intro": "Oenothera kunthiana, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant is adapted to arid environments, featuring hairy stems and leaves that reduce water loss. Its seeds are encased in a capsule that splits open to release the seeds when mature. Oenothera kunthiana is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
