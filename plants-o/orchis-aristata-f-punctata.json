    "intro": "Orchis aristata f. punctata, commonly known as the spotted orchis, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of large, showy flowers that typically range in color from violet to deep purple. The leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This orchid thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
