    "intro": "Ophelia dalhousiana, commonly known as the yellow water-plantain, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often submerged, with whorled leaves that are lance-shaped and have a smooth, waxy surface. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences at the top of the stems. Ophelia dalhousiana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
