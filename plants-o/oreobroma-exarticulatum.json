    "intro": "Oreobroma exarticulatum, commonly known as the rock sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow ray flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Oreobroma exarticulatum is often found in open habitats such as cliffs, slopes, and gravelly areas."
