    "intro": "Oncidium dasytyle, commonly known as the showy orchid, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. The plant has strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Oncidium dasytyle is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
