    "intro": "Ononis tridentata var. integrata, commonly known as the smooth bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological studies and traditional herbal uses."
