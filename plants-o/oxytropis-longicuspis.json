    "intro": "Oxytropis longicuspis, commonly known as the long-cusped locoweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, kidney-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, and it is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is sometimes considered a noxious weed in agricultural areas."
