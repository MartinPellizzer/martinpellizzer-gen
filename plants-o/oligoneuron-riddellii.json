    "intro": "Oligoneuron riddellii, commonly known as the Riddell's oligoneuron, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are slender and often branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oligoneuron riddellii is considered a botanically significant species with potential ecological importance in its native ecosystems."
