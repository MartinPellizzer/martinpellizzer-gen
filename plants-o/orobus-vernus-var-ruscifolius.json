It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically hairy and have a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, is a distinguishing characteristic. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows."
