    "intro": "Ornithoglossum glaucum var. zeyheri, commonly known as the Zeyher's bluebell, is a striking perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features lance-shaped, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue and purple, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a desirable addition to rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
