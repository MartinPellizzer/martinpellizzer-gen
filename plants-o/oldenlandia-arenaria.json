    "intro": "Oldenlandia arenaria, commonly known as beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing herb with slender stems and small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and along shorelines. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its seeds are enclosed in persistent, showy calyces. This species is adapted to salt spray and high wind, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
