    "intro": "Opuntia dillenii var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf prickly pear, is a compact cactus species native to the arid regions of Central America. It features short, rounded stems covered in clusters of small, spiny areoles, which bear glochids and flowers. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its succulent leaves store water, enabling it to thrive in dry environments. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
