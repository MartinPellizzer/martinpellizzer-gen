    "intro": "Oxymyrsine, commonly known as the \"devil's ink\" or \"poisonous nightshade,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It contains toxic alkaloids, such as oxymyrtine, which can be harmful to humans and animals if ingested. The plant typically has small, white or purple flowers and elliptical, waxy leaves. Its berries are often bright red or orange, which can be misleading as they are not edible. Oxymyrsine is native to various regions in Africa and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value despite its poisonous properties."
