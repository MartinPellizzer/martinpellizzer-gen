    "intro": "Oleobachia, commonly known as the golden cupplant, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in clustered inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. Oleobachia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species for pollinators and a valuable component of native plant communities."
