    "intro": "[WRONG START] Obernna variegata, commonly known as the variegated fern, is a striking plant characterized by its intricate, feather-like fronds. Its leaves are typically a mix of green, white, and sometimes yellow, creating a visually appealing contrast. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of its fronds. Oberna variegata is known for its ability to purify the air, adding both aesthetic and functional value to its surroundings."
