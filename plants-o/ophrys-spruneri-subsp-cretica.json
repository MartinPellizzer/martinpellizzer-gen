    "intro": "Ophrys spruneri subsp. cretica, commonly known as the Cretan bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid native to the island of Crete. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils in open habitats, such as grasslands and slopes. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow with intricate patterns, and it blooms during the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
