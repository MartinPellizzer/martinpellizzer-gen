    "intro": "Opuntia sericea, commonly known as the silver pricklypear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems covered in a dense layer of white, silky hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Opuntia sericea is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its structure and adaptations make it well-suited for survival in harsh desert conditions."
