    "intro": "Onobrychis pallasii, commonly known as Pallas's burclover, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces pod-like fruits that contain several small, smooth seeds. Onobrychis pallasii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
