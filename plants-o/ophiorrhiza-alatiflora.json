    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza alatiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mangrove, is a small shrub native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous stems and small, elliptical leaves that are usually opposite or alternate. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that are adapted for dispersal by water. It thrives in brackish or saline environments, often found in mangrove forests and coastal areas. Ophiorrhiza alatiflora plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
