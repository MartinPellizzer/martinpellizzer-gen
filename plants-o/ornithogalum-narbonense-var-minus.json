    "intro": "Ornithogalum narbonense var. minus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of star-shaped white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along streambanks. It produces small, spherical berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Ornithogalum narbonense."
