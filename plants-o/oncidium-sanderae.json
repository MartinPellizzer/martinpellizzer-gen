It features vibrant, long-lasting blooms in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often with contrasting patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in seasonal climates. Oncidium sanderae is prized for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
