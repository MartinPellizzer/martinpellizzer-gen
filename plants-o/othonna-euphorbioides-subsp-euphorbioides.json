    "intro": "Othonna euphorbioides subsp. euphorbioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved othonna, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, fleshy leaves arranged in a basal rosette, which help it store water and withstand arid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of yellow or green, typically in spring. Its stems are often branched and covered in a waxy cuticle, reducing water loss. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
