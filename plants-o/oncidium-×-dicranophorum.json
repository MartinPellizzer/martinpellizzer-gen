    "intro": "Oncidium \u00d7 dicranophorum, commonly known as the curly hair orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to South America. It is characterized by its long, spirally twisted stems and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its leaves are strap-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture. Oncidium \u00d7 dicranophorum is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
