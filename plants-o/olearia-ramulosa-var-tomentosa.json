    "intro": "Olearia ramulosa var. tomentosa, commonly known as the silver-haired daisy, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like white flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its hardiness and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
