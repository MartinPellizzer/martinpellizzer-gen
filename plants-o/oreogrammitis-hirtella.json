    "intro": "Oreogrammitis hirtella, commonly known as the hairy rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in rocky, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or along streams. The plant has a distinctive appearance with finely divided, hirsute fronds that give it a soft, velvety texture. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Oreogrammitis hirtella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
