    "intro": "Opuntia parryi var. bernardina, commonly known as the Bernard's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy pads, known as cladodes, which are typically green and covered in spines. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant is also notable for its role in traditional medicine and as a food source for wildlife."
