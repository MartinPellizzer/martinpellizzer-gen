    "intro": "Oliganthes macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf oliganthes, is a striking member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. Native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Chile and Argentina, this plant thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its most distinctive feature is its large, broad leaves, which can reach up to 30 cm in length, giving it a dramatic appearance in gardens. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage and delicate floral display. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a backdrop in perennial beds."
