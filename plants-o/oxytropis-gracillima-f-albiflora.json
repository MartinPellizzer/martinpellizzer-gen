    "intro": "Oxytropis gracillima f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered silky locoweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. This variety is distinguished by its pale floral coloration, which sets it apart from the typical darker flowers of the species."
