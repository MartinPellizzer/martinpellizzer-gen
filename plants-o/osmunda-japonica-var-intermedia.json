It is a deciduous fern characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is native to eastern Asia, including Japan and China. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Osmunda japonica var. intermedia is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a decorative plant in water features."
