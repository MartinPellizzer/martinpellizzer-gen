    "intro": "Oxyria, commonly known as the water shield, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Alismataceae. It is characterized by its floating or submerged leaves, which are typically broad and rounded, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers are small and greenish-white, usually clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and are pollinated by wind or insects. Oxyria species are found in freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams across temperate regions. These plants play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
