    "intro": "Onobrychis vassilczenkoi, commonly known as the Vassilczeko's burclover, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, followed by cylindrical, hairy pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is adapted to dry, temperate climates. Due to its hardiness and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
