    "intro": "Oxytropis dissitiflora, commonly known as the scattered-flower locoweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features slender stems that are often sparsely branched, with small, compound leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences, producing small, pea-like blooms that range in color from white to pale pink. Oxytropis dissitiflora is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native range."
