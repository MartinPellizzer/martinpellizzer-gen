It is a herbaceous perennial with striking, showy flowers that resemble lilies, hence its common name. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern. The flowers are borne on tall, erect inflorescences and come in shades of white, pink, and purple, making it a popular choice for ornamental cultivation."
