    "intro": "Ophrys gresivaudanica, commonly known as the Gresivaudan orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the alpine regions of the French Alps. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-mimicking flowers that feature a distinctive yellow and brown pattern resembling a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a single spike bearing several showy, bilaterally symmetrical flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophrys gresivaudanica is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
