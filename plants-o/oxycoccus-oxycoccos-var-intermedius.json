    "intro": "Oxycoccus oxycoccos var. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate cranberry, is a variant of the cranberry plant native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing, evergreen shrub characterized by its small, red berries that are typically harvested in the fall. The plant thrives in acidic, wet soils and is often found in bogs and swampy areas. Its leaves are elliptical, dark green, and have a slightly waxy texture. The berries are edible, though they are generally smaller and less tart compared to the common cranberry."
