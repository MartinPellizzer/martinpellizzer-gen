It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and dense, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible, sour fruits similar to those of the tamarind. Oxandra leucodermis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has some traditional uses in local medicine. Its growth habit and botanical features make it a distinctive species within its native habitat."
