    "intro": "Opuntia pelaguensis, commonly known as the Pelage\u00f1o prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia pelaguensis thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soil conditions and high temperatures. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
