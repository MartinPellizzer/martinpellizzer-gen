    "intro": "Oxytropis saximontana, commonly known as the Sierra bupleurum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky and arid environments, showcasing a compact growth habit. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink to purple in color, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Oxytropis saximontana is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations."
