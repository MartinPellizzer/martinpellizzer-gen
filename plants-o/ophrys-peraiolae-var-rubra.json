    "intro": "Ophrys peraiolae var. rubra, commonly known as the red orchid bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, which mimics the appearance of female wasps to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with a distinctive red coloration in this variant, enhancing its mimicry. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as limestone soils and grasslands. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species and is often protected in its native range."
