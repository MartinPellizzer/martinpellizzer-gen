    "intro": "Orchis jacquinii var. godronii, commonly known as Godron's early purple orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its flowers have a distinctive three-lobed lip, which is a key feature in its classification. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this species is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
