It typically features basal leaves that are linear to oblanceolate in shape, with a glabrous or softly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of dry, open habitats in its native range."
