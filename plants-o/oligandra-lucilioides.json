    "intro": "Oligandra lucilioides, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its thick, succulent stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its latex sap is milky and can cause skin irritation, a common trait among members of its family. Oligandra lucilioides is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to tolerate drought conditions."
