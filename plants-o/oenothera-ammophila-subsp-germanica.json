    "intro": "Oenothera ammophila subsp. germanica, commonly known as the German sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to sandy coastal areas of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for pollinators. Its ecological importance is significant in coastal ecosystems where it contributes to biodiversity."
