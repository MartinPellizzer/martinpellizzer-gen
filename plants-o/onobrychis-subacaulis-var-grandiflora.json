    "intro": "Onobrychis subacaulis var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered burr medic, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers clustered in spherical heads, which are followed by distinctive, spiny pods. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. This species is valued for its forage qualities and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
