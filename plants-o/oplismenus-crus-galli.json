    "intro": "Oplismenus crus-galli, commonly known as the \"crane's-bill,\" is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a three-lobed, dry capsule that splits open to release seeds, a feature typical of many members of the buckwheat family. Oplismenus crus-galli is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant's common name is derived from its resemblance to the bill of a crane when viewed from above."
