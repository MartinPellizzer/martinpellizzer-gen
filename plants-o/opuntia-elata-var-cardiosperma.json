    "intro": "Opuntia elata var. cardiosperma, commonly known as the desert hedgehog cactus, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, spine-tipped pads and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are modified into spiny stems, reducing water loss through transpiration. The fruit, which develops from the flower, is a small, fleshy pear-shaped structure that contains edible seeds."
