    "intro": "Ouratea parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered ouratea, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in umbels, often appearing in the axils of the leaves. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that releases seeds when mature. Ouratea parviflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in warm, humid climates."
