    "intro": "Oxalis chapmaniae, commonly known as the Chapman's wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the United States, specifically found in the Appalachian Mountains. It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its botanical features include stipitate (stalked) leaves and a distinctive, creeping rhizome system that helps it spread and establish in its habitat. Oxalis chapmaniae is a relatively rare species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
