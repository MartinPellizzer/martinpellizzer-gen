    "intro": "Odontoglossum \u00d7 histrionicum, commonly known as the flame orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that often display a striking combination of red, orange, and yellow hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store moisture in the dry environments it inhabits. The orchid produces pseudobulbs that support its growth and help it survive periods of drought."
