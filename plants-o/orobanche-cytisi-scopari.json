    "intro": "Orobanche cytisi-scopari, commonly known as the yellow broom broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically parasitizes species within the Fabaceae family, such as those in the genus Cytisus. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by the host plant. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
