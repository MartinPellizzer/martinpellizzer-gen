    "intro": "Ophrys oestrifera var. grandiflora, commonly known as the Large-flowered Bee Orchid, is a striking orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral structure, which features a vivid yellow and brown lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee. The plant produces showy, downward-facing flowers with a distinctive, hairy lip that plays a crucial role in pollination by attracting male bees. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodland and grassland habitats. This orchid is known for its specialized pollination mechanism, where the male bees attempt to mate with the flower, inadvertently transferring pollen."
