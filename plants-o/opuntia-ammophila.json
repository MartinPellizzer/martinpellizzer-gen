    "intro": "Opuntia ammophila, commonly known as the sand flat cactus, is a species of prickly pear cactus native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its flattened, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by bright red or orange fruits. Opuntia ammophila is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in environments with low rainfall. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of desert ecosystems."
