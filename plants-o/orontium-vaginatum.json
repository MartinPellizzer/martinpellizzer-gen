    "intro": "Orontium vaginatum, commonly known as the water clover, is a aquatic plant native to North America. It has slender, branching stems that float on the water surface, with small, oval leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate, and it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems. Orontium vaginatum is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches."
