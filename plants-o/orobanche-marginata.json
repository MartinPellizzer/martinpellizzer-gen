    "intro": "Orobanche marginata, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa. The plant produces small, often yellow or greenish flowers and has a short, thick stem with no true leaves. It is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to parasitize a wide range of host plants. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth of its host, making it a challenging species to manage in crop fields."
