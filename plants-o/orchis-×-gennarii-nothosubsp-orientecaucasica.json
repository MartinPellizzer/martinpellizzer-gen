    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 gennarii nothosubsp. orientecaucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian hybrid orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Orchis gennarii and Orchis mascula. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous grasslands and forest edges across the Caucasus region. It has lanceolate leaves with a hairy surface and produces a single, elongated flower spike. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
