    "intro": "Oxyacantha succulenta, commonly known as the succulent spindle tree, is a member of the Rutaceae family. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, a typical adaptation for arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are usually small and oval, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Oxyacantha succulenta is native to regions with dry climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance."
