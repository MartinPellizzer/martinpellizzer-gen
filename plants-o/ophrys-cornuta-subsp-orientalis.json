The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with a complex morphology that enhances its pollination efficiency. The subspecies is notable for its specialized adaptations and is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
