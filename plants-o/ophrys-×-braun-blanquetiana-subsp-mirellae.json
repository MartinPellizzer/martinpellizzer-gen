It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of a bee's body. This subspecies is valued for its unique morphology and ecological role in pollination systems."
