    "intro": "Oreocarya thompsonii, commonly known as Thompson's oreocarya, is a rare flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada in California. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
