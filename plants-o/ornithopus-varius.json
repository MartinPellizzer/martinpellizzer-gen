    "intro": "Ornithopus varius, commonly known as the variable ornithopus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are pinnately compound, and it produces seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Ornithopus varius is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in disturbed environments."
