    "intro": "Opuntia larreyi, commonly known as the Sonoran prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in sharp spines and clusters of small, glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia larreyi is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
