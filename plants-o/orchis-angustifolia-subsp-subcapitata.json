It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or meadow habitats. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces a tall, unbranched stem topped with a dense cluster of pale yellow to greenish flowers. Its flowers are characterized by a distinctive hooded lip and are pollinated by specific insects. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitats."
