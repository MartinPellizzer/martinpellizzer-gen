    "intro": "Ortgiesia caudata, commonly known as the long-tailed orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, elongated inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, with a unique structure that attracts specific pollinators. Ortgiesia caudata thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in the understory of rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
