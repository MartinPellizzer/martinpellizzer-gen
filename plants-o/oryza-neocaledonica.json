    "intro": "Oryza neocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonia ricegrass, is a species of grass native to the island of New Caledonia in the South Pacific. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, coastal environments, often found in sandy or limestone soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny grains of rice-like seeds. It is considered a rare and endemic species, with limited distribution and specific ecological requirements. Due to its unique habitat and restricted range, Oryza neocaledonica is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
