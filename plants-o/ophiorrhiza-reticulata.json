    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined mangrove, is a flowering plant species native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small, shrub-like tree that thrives in brackish water environments, often found in mangrove forests. The plant has small, elliptical leaves with a distinctive network of veins, which contribute to its scientific name. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
