It is a herbaceous plant with tall, slender stems that bear clusters of showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats across Europe and parts of Asia. Its flowers are characterized by their intricate structure, including three sepals and three petals, with the latter often modified into a lip. Orchis \u00d7 corcyrensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local biodiversity."
