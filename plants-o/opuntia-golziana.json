    "intro": "Opuntia golziana, commonly known as the golden prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are small, hair-like spines. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, spherical fruits. Opuntia golziana is adapted to arid environments and has a shallow root system to conserve water. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in some regions."
