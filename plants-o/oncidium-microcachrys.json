    "intro": "Oncidium microcachrys, commonly known as the miniature orchid or small cachrys orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It features a compact growth habit with slender pseudobulbs and linear, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often resembling a miniature orchid bouquet. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Oncidium microcachrys is prized for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements in suitable environments."
