    "intro": "Onobrychis inermis, commonly known as narrow-leafed clover, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and drought conditions. It is often used in forage and soil conservation due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its foliage is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
