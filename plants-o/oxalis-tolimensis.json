    "intro": "Oxalis tolimensis, commonly known as the Tolimense wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant produces bright orange to red berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Oxalis tolimensis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain areas."
