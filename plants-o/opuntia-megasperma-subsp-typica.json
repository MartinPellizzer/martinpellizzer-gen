    "intro": "Opuntia megasperma subsp. typica, commonly known as the Texas prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems, which are covered in sharp spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Opuntia megasperma subsp. typica is also known for its ability to propagate through offsets, making it a resilient and widely distributed species."
