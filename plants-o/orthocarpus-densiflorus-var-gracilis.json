It is characterized by its slender stems and dense, small flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
