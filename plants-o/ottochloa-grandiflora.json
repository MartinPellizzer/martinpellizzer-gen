    "intro": "Ottochloa grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered grass, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, white to pale blue florets, which are often clustered in dense, panicle-like structures. Ottochloa grandiflora thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, particularly in regions with a temperate climate."
