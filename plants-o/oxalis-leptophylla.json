    "intro": "Oxalis leptophylla, commonly known as the slender-leaf wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a waxy, glossy surface and produces small, yellow flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky outcrops. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Oxalis leptophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowers."
