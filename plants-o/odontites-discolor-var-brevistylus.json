    "intro": "Odontites discolor var. brevistylus, commonly known as the slender-styled toothweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are arranged in clustered umbels, and the variety brevistylus is distinguished by its shorter, more slender styles compared to the typical form. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats."
