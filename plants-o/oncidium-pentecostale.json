    "intro": "Oncidium pentecostale, commonly known as the Holy Ghost orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, often pendulous growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive white throat. The plant typically has dark green, strap-like leaves and thrives in bright, indirect light with high humidity. It is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements. Oncidium pentecostale is also valued for its ability to bloom multiple times a year under proper conditions."
