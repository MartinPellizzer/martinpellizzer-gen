    "intro": "Oxytropis baicalensis, commonly known as the Baikal oxytropis, is a flowering plant native to the mountains of Central Asia, particularly in regions of Mongolia and Russia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale blue or purple in color. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
