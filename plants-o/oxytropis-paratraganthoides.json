    "intro": "Oxytropis paratraganthoides, commonly known as the paratraganthoid milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has small, pinnately compound leaves with stipules, and its root system is well adapted to drought conditions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Oxytropis paratraganthoides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
