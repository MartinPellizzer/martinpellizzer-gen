    "intro": "Oxydectes nummularia, commonly known as silver carpet, is a low-growing evergreen perennial that forms dense mats of silver-gray foliage. It is native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in spring, which are followed by bright red berries. Its compact growth habit and silvery leaves make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
