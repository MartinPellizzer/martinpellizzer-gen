    "intro": "Oldenlandia fastigiata var. longifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silverleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
