    "intro": "Oxytropis kudoana, commonly known as Kudo's locoweed, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, which helps improve soil fertility. However, it can be toxic to livestock if consumed in large quantities."
