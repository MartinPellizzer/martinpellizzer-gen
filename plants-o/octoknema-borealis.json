    "intro": "Octoknema borealis, commonly known as the northern octoknema, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor environments. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in whorls around the stem. It produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. Octoknema borealis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and provides food for local wildlife."
