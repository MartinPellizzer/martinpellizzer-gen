    "intro": "Opuntia wrightii, commonly known as the Wright's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible fruits that are often consumed by both humans and animals. Opuntia wrightii is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its structure and growth habits make it a notable species in desert ecosystems."
