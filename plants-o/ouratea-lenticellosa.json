It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in panicles, which bloom during the wet season. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
