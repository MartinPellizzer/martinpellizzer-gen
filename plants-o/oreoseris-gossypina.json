    "intro": "Oreoseris gossypina, commonly known as the cottonroot or cottonweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its most distinctive feature is the fluffy, cotton-like seeds that are released from the flower head, aiding in wind dispersal. Oreoseris gossypina is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by some Native American tribes."
