    "intro": "Oxalis bialata, commonly known as the silverleaf wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a silvery sheen and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is a perennial herb that produces small, edible leaves and flowers, though they are often less palatable than those of other oxalis species. Oxalis bialata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
