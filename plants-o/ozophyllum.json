    "intro": "Ozophyllum, commonly known as the starfruit or carambola, is a tropical fruit-bearing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive five-pointed star shape when sliced, which gives it its common name. The plant is a small shrub that produces clusters of yellow-orange fruits with a tangy, acidic flavor. Ozophyllum thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. It is widely cultivated for its edible fruit, which is rich in vitamin C and often used in both fresh and processed forms."
