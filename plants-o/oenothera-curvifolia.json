    "intro": "Oenothera curvifolia, commonly known as the curlleaf evening primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features showy yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. The plant has slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically borne in clusters at the ends of the stems, and the plant produces capsule fruits that release seeds when mature. Oenothera curvifolia is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
