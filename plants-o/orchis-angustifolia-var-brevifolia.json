    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia var. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, violet or purple flowers in late spring. Its inflorescence consists of a single spike bearing several small, hooded flowers. This variant is distinguished by its shorter leaves compared to the typical form of Orchis angustifolia."
