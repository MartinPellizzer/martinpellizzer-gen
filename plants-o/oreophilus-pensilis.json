    "intro": "Oreophilus pensilis, commonly known as the hanging mountain orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, pendulous stems that often hang from rocky outcrops or trees, giving it its common name. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to retain moisture in its arid, mountainous habitat. Oreophilus pensilis is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
