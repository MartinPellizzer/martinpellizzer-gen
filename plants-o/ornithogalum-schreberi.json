It features a short, rhizomatous stem and produces umbels of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is adapted to arid environments and has a long dormancy period during dry seasons. Ornithogalum schreberi is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and ease of cultivation."
