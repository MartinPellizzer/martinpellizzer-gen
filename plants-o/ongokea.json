    "intro": "Ongokea, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. The trees are characterized by their dark, aromatic wood and are often found in moist, well-drained soils. Ongokea species typically have simple, opposite leaves and produce small, white or yellowish flowers. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural distribution in the wild."
