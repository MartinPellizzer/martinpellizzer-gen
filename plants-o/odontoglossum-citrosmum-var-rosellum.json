    "intro": "Odontoglossum citrosmum var. rosellum, commonly known as the Rosellum orchid, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is a sympodial orchid with a compact growth habit, featuring pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, often with intricate patterns. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
