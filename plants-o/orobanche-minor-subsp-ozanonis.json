    "intro": "Orobanche minor subsp. ozanonis, commonly known as the lesser broomrape, is a hemiparasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short, tuberous stem with numerous branches. It typically parasitizes members of the Fabaceae family, such as vetches and clovers. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native habitats."
