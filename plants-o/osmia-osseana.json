    "intro": "Osmia osseana, commonly known as the Ossean mason bee, is a solitary bee species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its robust body, typically ranging from 10 to 15 millimeters in length, and its dark, often metallic-colored appearance. The female constructs its nest by chewing and shaping plant material, primarily using stems of grasses or reeds. Osmia osseana is an important pollinator, contributing to the pollination of various flowering plants. Its life cycle involves overwintering as a pupa in the underground burrow it has prepared."
