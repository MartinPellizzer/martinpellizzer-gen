    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 pantalicae, commonly known as the Balkan bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its flowers are usually yellow or brownish in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects. Ophrys \u00d7 pantalicae is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, often with a strong, honey-like scent."
