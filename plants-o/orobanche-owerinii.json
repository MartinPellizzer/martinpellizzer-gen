    "intro": "Orobanche owerinii, commonly known as the African witchweed, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to parts of Africa, particularly in countries like Nigeria and Ghana. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is known for its ability to cause significant damage to crops such as maize and sorghum. Due to its parasitic nature and impact on agriculture, it is considered a serious weed in many regions."
