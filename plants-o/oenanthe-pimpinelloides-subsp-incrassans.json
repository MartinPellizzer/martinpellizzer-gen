    "intro": "Oenanthe pimpinelloides subsp. incrassans, commonly known as the broad-leaved water dropwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along stream banks, wet meadows, and marshy areas. The plant features arrow-shaped leaves that are often broad and have a distinctive white midrib, while its small, greenish-white flowers appear in umbels. It is characterized by its aromatic, somewhat toxic sap, which contains various glucosides. The subspecies incrassans is distinguished by its larger leaves and more robust growth compared to other subspecies of Oenanthe pimpinelloides."
