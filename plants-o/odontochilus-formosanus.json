    "intro": "Odontochilus formosanus, commonly known as the Formosan toothed orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to Taiwan. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its unique tooth-like structures on the labellum, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on forest floors or rocky substrates. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and usually display a combination of white, green, and yellow hues. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
