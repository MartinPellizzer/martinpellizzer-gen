    "intro": "Ononis villosa, commonly known as hairy restharrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Ononis villosa is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
