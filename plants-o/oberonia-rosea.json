    "intro": "Oberonia rosea, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green to purple-colored foliage and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are often arranged in a spiral pattern, giving it a unique and ornamental appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oberonia rosea is considered a conservation concern."
