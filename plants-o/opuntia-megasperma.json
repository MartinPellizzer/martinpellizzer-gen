    "intro": "Opuntia megasperma, commonly known as the giant prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruits, called tunas, are edible and have a sweet, tangy flavor. Opuntia megasperma is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
