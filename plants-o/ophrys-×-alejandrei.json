    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 alejandrei, commonly known as the Alexandrian bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are predominantly yellow with dark markings, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Ophrys \u00d7 alejandrei is valued for its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
