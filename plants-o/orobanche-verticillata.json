    "intro": "Orobanche verticillata, commonly known as the clustered broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and depends entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces numerous tiny, pink to purple flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a weed in agricultural fields. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops by reducing their growth and yield."
