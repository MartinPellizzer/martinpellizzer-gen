    "intro": "Olax capuronii, commonly known as the Capuron's olax, is a shrub native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Olacaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruits are capsule-like structures containing seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, Olax capuronii is considered a rare and endemic species."
