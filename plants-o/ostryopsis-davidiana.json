    "intro": "Ostryopsis davidiana, commonly known as the Chinese cliffbrake, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Ostryopsis davidiana is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
