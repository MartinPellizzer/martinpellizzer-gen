    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza plumbea, commonly known as the silver vine, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. Its flowers are usually white or pale green and are borne in clusters. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
