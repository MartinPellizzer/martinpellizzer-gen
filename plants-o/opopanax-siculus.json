    "intro": "Opopanax siculus, commonly known as the Sicilian opoponax, is a rare and ancient plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes frankincense and myrrh trees. The plant is characterized by its aromatic resin, which has been used historically for medicinal and aromatic purposes. Its small, simple leaves and woody stem make it distinct from other members of its family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
