    "intro": "Orontium calycinum, commonly known as the water buttercup, is a aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has floating leaves that are round with a waxy coating, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of water bodies. Orontium calycinum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and aiding in water filtration."
