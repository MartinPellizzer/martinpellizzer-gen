    "intro": "Oligosporus tomentellus, commonly known as the woolly spore moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is covered in a fine, woolly layer of hairs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are small and club-shaped, bearing spores that are dispersed by wind. Oligosporus tomentellus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
