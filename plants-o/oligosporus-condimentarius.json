It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and serrated, aromatic leaves that emit a pungent odor. The plant is native to temperate regions and thrives in disturbed soils, often found along roadsides and in agricultural fields. Its leaves are used in some traditional cuisines for their sharp, spicy flavor. However, it is considered a noxious weed due to its rapid growth and invasive nature."
