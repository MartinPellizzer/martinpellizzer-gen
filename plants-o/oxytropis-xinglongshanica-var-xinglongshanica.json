    "intro": "Oxytropis xinglongshanica var. xinglongshanica, commonly known as the Xinglongshan milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to China. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or steppe habitats. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
