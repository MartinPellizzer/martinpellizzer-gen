    "intro": "Osteospermum piliferum, commonly known as the woolly osteospermum, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its fluffy, white to pale yellow flowers that resemble daisies. The plant features hairy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It produces small, dark brown seeds enclosed in a hard, spiky pappus, aiding in wind dispersal. Osteospermum piliferum is often grown as an ornamental plant for its attractive appearance and drought tolerance."
