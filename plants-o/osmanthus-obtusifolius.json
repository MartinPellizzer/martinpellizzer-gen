    "intro": "Osmanthus obtusifolius, commonly known as sweet osmanthus, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in late summer, which are highly valued for their aromatic properties. These flowers are often used in traditional Chinese medicine and as a flavoring in teas and confections. Osmanthus obtusifolius is also cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
