    "intro": "Ononis natrix f. barcinensis, commonly known as the Barcino sandwort, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal or semi-arid habitats. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
