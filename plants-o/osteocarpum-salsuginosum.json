    "intro": "Osteocarpum salsuginosum, commonly known as the salt marsh aster, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant thrives in saline or brackish wetlands, demonstrating a high tolerance for salt and waterlogged soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Osteocarpum salsuginosum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
