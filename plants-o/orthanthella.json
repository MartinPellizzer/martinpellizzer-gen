    "intro": "Orthanthella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. Orthanthella thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on the trunks of trees in swamps or pine forests. Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, it is considered endangered and protected in many regions."
