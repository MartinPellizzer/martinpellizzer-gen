    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. elongata, commonly known as the long-grain rice variety, is a cultivated rice species characterized by its elongated grains. This variety is primarily grown in tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with long, slender leaves and panicles that produce numerous small, white flowers. Its grains are generally less sticky than other rice varieties, making them suitable for dishes that require separate grains. The botanical features of Oryza sativa var. elongata make it an important crop for both food security and agricultural biodiversity."
