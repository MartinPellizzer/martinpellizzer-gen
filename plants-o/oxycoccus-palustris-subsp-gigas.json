    "intro": "Oxycoccus palustris subsp. gigas, commonly known as the giant cranberry, is a subspecies of the cranberry plant native to northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its large, fleshy red berries that are typically harvested in the fall. The plant thrives in acidic, wet soils and is often found in bogs and swampy areas. Its leaves are oval-shaped and have a slightly waxy texture, while its stems are prostrate, allowing it to spread across the ground. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in wetland habitats and its potential use in horticulture and food production."
