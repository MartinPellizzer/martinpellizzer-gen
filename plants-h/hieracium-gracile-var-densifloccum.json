    "intro": "Hieracium gracile var. densifloccum, commonly known as the dense floccose hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish to reddish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and grasslands. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, including parts of North America. Its floccose (downy) appearance is due to the dense covering of fine hairs on its stems and leaves."
