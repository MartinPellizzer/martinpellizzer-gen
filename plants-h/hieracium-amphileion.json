    "intro": "Hieracium amphileion, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are broadly lance-shaped with a rough texture, and its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium amphileion is often considered a weed but can provide nectar for pollinators."
