It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often coated with a fine layer of wax. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Hyparrhenia figariana is well adapted to dry conditions and can thrive in sandy or rocky soils. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
