    "intro": "Hibiscus tiliaceus var. henryanus, commonly known as the white hibiscus, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant thrives in coastal areas and is often found in mangrove ecosystems due to its salt tolerance. Its flowers are typically 5-lobed and have a prominent central stigma, typical of the Malvaceae family. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in some cultures."
