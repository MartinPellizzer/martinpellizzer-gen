    "intro": "Hypochaeris, commonly known as the common groundsel, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and showy yellow flowers that resemble dandelions. They are typically found in disturbed soils and open areas, often thriving in temperate regions. Hypochaeris species are annual or biennial herbs, with some species being invasive in certain parts of the world. Their seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to their widespread distribution."
