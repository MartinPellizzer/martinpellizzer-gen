    "intro": "Hieracium mapirense, commonly known as the Mapire hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in regions of Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grasslands and disturbed soils, exhibiting a low-growing habit with hairy stems and serrated leaves. Its flowers are yellow, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, and it produces small, oval-shaped achenes as its seeds. Hieracium mapirense is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid spread and adaptability."
