    "intro": "Hemionitis pedatoides, commonly known as the walking fern, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its distinctive stolons that appear to \"walk\" across the substrate. It is native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America and Asia, where it thrives in shallow water or moist soil. The plant has a rosette-like structure with fronds that curl into a tight spiral when dry, allowing it to survive periods of drought. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that release spores, enabling propagation through spore dispersal. The plant's ability to spread vegetatively makes it an effective colonizer of disturbed wetland habitats."
