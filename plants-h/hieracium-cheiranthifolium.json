    "intro": "Hieracium cheiranthifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves and produces yellow or orange composite flowers. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has a taproot system and is often found in temperate climates. It is considered a weed in some agricultural areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
