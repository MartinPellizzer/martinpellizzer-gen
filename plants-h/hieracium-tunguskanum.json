    "intro": "Hieracium tunguskanum, commonly known as the Tungus hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and tundra, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. Hieracium tunguskanum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent and widespread species in its native range."
