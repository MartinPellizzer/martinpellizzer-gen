    "intro": "Hedyotis plantaginea, commonly known as the creeping marshplant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland and marshy environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it an effective pioneer species in disturbed wetland habitats. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
