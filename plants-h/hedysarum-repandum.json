    "intro": "Hedysarum repandum, commonly known as the common vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to orange pea-like flowers. The plant has a sprawling growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. Its small, pod-like fruits contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Hedysarum repandum is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it valuable for soil enrichment and erosion control."
