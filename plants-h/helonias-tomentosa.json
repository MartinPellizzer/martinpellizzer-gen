    "intro": "Helonias tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly bladdernut, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its grayish-white, woolly foliage and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release seeds with silky hairs. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Helonias tomentosa plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and insects."
