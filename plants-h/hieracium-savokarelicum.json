    "intro": "Hieracium savokarelicum, commonly known as the Savokarelic hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its yellowish flowers bloom in summer, and the plant produces achenes as its seed dispersal mechanism. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
