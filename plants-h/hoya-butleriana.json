It is characterized by its thick, waxy, ovate leaves that are often variegated with shades of white and green. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming infrequently under optimal conditions. Hoya butleriana is a slow-growing plant that thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. It is popular among indoor gardeners for its attractive foliage and air-purifying qualities."
