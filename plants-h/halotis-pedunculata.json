    "intro": "Halotis pedunculata, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to xeriscaping and coastal landscapes."
