    "intro": "Helonias striata, commonly known as the marsh helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features a tall, erect stem with lance-shaped leaves and produces striking, hooded flowers with purple and yellow markings. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects. Helonias striata thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps and bogs. It is a perennial species that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense colonies in suitable environments."
