    "intro": "Hicriopteris glabra, commonly known as the smooth holly fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green and covered in a fine, smooth texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Hicriopteris glabra is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, cool climates."
