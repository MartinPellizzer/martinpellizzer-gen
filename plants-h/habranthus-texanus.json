    "intro": "Habranthus texanus, commonly known as the Texas starflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its star-shaped, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
