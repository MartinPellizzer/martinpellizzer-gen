    "intro": "Helianthus annuus var. reversus, commonly known as the reverse sunflower, is a unique variant of the common sunflower. It is characterized by its distinctive reverse heliotropic behavior, where the flower head turns away from the sun rather than towards it. This trait is a result of genetic mutation and is most noticeable during the day when the plant's inflorescence faces downward. The plant retains the typical structure of Helianthus annuus, with large, showy yellow petals surrounding a central disk of florets. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can be found in gardens and natural habitats across North America."
