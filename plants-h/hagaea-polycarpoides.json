    "intro": "Hagaea polycarpoides, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing structure with dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Hagaea polycarpoides is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
