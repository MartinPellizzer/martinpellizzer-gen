    "intro": "Hieracium praealtum var. stoloniferum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and basal leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It spreads via stolons, forming dense mats that can dominate disturbed soils. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
