    "intro": "Heliconia sanctae-martae, commonly known as the Santa Marta heliconia, is a tropical plant native to the Andes Mountains of Colombia. It is characterized by its large, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces striking, tubular inflorescences that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are broad and often have a waxy texture, adapted to the humid and shaded environments of its native habitat. The Santa Marta heliconia is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its region."
