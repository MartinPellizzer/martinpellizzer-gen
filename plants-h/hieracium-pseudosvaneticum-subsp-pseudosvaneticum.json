    "intro": "Hieracium pseudosvaneticum subsp. pseudosvaneticum, commonly known as the false hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically has basal leaves that are broadly lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a noxious weed in certain regions."
