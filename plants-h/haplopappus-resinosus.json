    "intro": "Haplopappus resinosus, commonly known as the resinous pappus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a resinous coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Haplopappus resinosus is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, often found in dry, open habitats."
