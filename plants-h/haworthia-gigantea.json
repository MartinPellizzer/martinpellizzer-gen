    "intro": "Haworthia gigantea, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features a thick, fleshy rosette of leaves that are typically green with distinct white or yellow markings resembling a zebra's stripes. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and requiring minimal watering. It thrives in bright, indirect sunlight and well-draining soil. Haworthia gigantea is popular as a low-maintenance indoor plant due to its compact size and unique appearance."
