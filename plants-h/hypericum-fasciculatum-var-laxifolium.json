    "intro": "Hypericum fasciculatum var. laxifolium, commonly known as the laxifoliate St. John's wort, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically narrow and arranged in dense clusters along the stems. This variant is distinguished by its more loosely spaced foliage compared to the typical form of Hypericum fasciculatum. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or woodland habitats."
