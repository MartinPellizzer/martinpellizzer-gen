    "intro": "Hoya columna, commonly known as the columnar hoya, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It features thick, fleshy stems that can grow quite long, often forming a column-like structure. The plant produces clusters of waxy, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, which bloom in response to bright light and consistent temperatures. Its leaves are typically thick and leathery, with a smooth texture and a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Hoya columna is well-suited for hanging baskets or trained on trellises due to its vine-like growth habit."
