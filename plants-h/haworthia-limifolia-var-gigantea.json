It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically fleshy and covered in a white powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
