    "intro": "Hieracium caesitioides, commonly known as the blue hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in grassy areas and meadows. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which attract various pollinators. Its leaves are basal, with a rough texture and a distinctive white or yellowish underside. Hieracium caesitioides is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
