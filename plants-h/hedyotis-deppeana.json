    "intro": "Hedyotis deppeana, commonly known as the silverleaf strobilanthes, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Hedyotis deppeana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
