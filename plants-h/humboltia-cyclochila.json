    "intro": "Humboltia cyclochila, commonly known as the yellow bell, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, often found in chaparral and desert habitats. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Humboltia cyclochila is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system to access water from deeper soil layers."
