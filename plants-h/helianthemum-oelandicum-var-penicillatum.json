    "intro": "Helianthemum oelandicum var. penicillatum, commonly known as the Oeland thyme or rock thyme, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, aromatic, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as coastal cliffs and limestone areas. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
