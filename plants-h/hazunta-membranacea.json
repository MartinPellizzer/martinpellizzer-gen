    "intro": "Hazunta membranacea, commonly known as the delicate membranous fern, is a rare and unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a thin, translucent membrane, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires partial shade for optimal growth. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in the axils of the leaves. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Hazunta membranacea is considered a vulnerable species."
