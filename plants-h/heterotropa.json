    "intro": "Heterotropa, commonly known as the false mallow, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species that are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their alternate, simple leaves and showy, often pink or purple flowers. The plants are native to regions in Africa, the Americas, and parts of Asia, and they often thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. Heterotropa species are known for their ability to fix nitrogen, which makes them valuable in soil enrichment. Their flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to their ecological significance."
