It is characterized by its silver-white, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Its foliage is covered in fine, white hairs that give it a distinctive appearance and help reduce water loss. It is often found in calcareous soils and is considered a member of the daisy family, Asteraceae."
