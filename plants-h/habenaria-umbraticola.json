    "intro": "Habenaria umbraticola, commonly known as the shade orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, often greenish or brownish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually broad and strap-like, adapted to capture limited light. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
