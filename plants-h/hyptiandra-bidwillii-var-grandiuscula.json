    "intro": "Hyptiandra bidwillii var. grandiuscula, commonly known as the broad-leafed ironwood, is a tropical tree native to northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces woody capsules containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rainforest or coastal habitats. Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically used in construction and tool-making."
