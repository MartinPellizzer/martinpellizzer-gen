    "intro": "Hesperhodos vernonii, commonly known as the Vernon's hesperhodos, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and slopes. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces seeds in capsule-like structures. Hesperhodos vernonii is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and limited distribution."
