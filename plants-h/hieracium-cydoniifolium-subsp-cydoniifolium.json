    "intro": "Hieracium cydoniifolium subsp. cydoniifolium, commonly known as the cydoniifolium hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
