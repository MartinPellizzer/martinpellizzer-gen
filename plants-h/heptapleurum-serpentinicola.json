    "intro": "Heptapleurum serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine heptapleurum, is a species of evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale yellow flowers, followed by elliptical, dark blue to black berries. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on nutrient-poor soils, particularly those containing serpentine rock. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
