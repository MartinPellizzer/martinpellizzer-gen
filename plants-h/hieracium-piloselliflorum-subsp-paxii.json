    "intro": "Hieracium piloselliflorum subsp. paxii, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in late summer. It is characterized by its small, glandular hairs and a distinctive, slightly hairy stem. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in high-altitude environments with limited soil nutrients."
