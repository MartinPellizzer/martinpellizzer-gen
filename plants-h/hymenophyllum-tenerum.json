    "intro": "Hymenophyllum tenerum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of moss-like fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a silvery, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its moist, shaded habitats. This plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in high humidity and indirect light. Its small, intricate leaves are usually less than 1 cm in length, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Hymenophyllum tenerum is an important component of epiphytic communities and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental appearance."
