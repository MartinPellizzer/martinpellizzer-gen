    "intro": "Hakea microcarpa, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a white, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, pink or red flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and ability to thrive in sandy soils make it well adapted to coastal and heathland habitats. Hakea microcarpa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
