It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink to white. The plant has hairy, often glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
