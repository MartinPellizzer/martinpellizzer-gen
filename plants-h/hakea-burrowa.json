    "intro": "Hakea burrowa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical or bottle-shaped stems that store water, an adaptation to its arid environment. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss through transpiration. Hakea burrowa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
