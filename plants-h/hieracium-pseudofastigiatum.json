    "intro": "Hieracium pseudofastigiatum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow daisy-like flowers and hairy, lobed leaves. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows and grasslands. The plant produces numerous small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas."
