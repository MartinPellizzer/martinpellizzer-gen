    "intro": "Helianthemum alpestre var. italicum, commonly known as the Italian rock rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has compact, evergreen foliage with silver-white leaves that are covered in fine hairs, providing a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant once established. This species is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
