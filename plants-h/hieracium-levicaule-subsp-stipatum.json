    "intro": "Hieracium levicaule subsp. stipatum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and forest edges. The plant features upright stems with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, characteristic of the Asteraceae family. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
