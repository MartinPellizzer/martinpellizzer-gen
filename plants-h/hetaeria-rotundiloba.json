    "intro": "Hetaeria rotundiloba, commonly known as the round-lobed hetaeria, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its palmate leaves with rounded lobes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the genus Hetaeria. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
