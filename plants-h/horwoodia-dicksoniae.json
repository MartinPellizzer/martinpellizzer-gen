    "intro": "Horwoodia dicksoniae, commonly known as the Dickson's horwoodia, is a rare and striking plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and arranged in clusters, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
