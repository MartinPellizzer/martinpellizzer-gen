    "intro": "Hydrocotyle hispidula var. tenella, commonly known as the hairy water pennywort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in ponds, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has finely divided, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, white flowers bloom in early summer, and it produces small, round fruits that disperse by water. This species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish."
