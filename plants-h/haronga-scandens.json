    "intro": "Haronga scandens, commonly known as the climbing haronga, is a vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by round, fleshy fruits. Haronga scandens thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rapid growth makes it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain areas."
