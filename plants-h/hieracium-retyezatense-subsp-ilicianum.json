    "intro": "Hieracium retyezatense subsp. ilicianum, commonly known as the Illyrian hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering heads that produce yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in mountainous regions. It has small, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
