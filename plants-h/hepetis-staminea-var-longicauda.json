    "intro": "Hepetis staminea var. longicauda, commonly known as the long-tailed hepptis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of eastern North America. It features slender, upright stems that are often branched and covered in fine, hairy textures. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers arranged in loose clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with serrated edges, and are typically arranged alternately along the stem. This variety is characterized by its elongated, trailing inflorescences, giving it its common name."
