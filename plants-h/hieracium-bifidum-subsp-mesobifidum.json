    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. mesobifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers in clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
