    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. pseudomaculosum, commonly known as the mouse-ear hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grassy areas, disturbed soils, and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowering stems are usually unbranched and bear several flower heads. The subspecies pseudomaculosum is distinguished by its smaller, more numerous flowers and a more compact growth habit compared to other subspecies of Hieracium murorum."
