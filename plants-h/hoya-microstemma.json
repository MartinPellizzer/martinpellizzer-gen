    "intro": "Hoya microstemma, commonly known as the miniature wax plant, is a compact, evergreen vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and clusters of small, waxy, white or pale pink flowers. The leaves are oval-shaped, glossy, and often have a slight waxy coating. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This plant is popular among collectors for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
