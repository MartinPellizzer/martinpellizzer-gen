    "intro": "Hieracium jubatum, commonly known as the showy hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features bright yellow flowers with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, and it typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Hieracium jubatum has lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It is often found in temperate climates and can spread through rhizomes or seeds, making it both a common and sometimes invasive species."
