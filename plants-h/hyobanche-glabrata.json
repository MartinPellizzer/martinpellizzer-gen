    "intro": "Hyobanche glabrata, commonly known as the naked stem morning glory, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Convolvulaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of other plants. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its seeds are small and often dispersed by wind or animals. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the growth of its host plants."
