It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
