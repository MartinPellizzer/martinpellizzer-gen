    "intro": "Habenaria pachycaulon, commonly known as the thick-stemmed sword orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its erect, grass-like foliage and striking, sword-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it can thrive in the dappled light. Its thick, succulent stems help it store water, adapting it to its often humid and tropical habitat. The flowers, which are usually pink or purple, are highly ornamental and attract various pollinators."
