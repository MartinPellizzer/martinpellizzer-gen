    "intro": "Hearnia sapindina, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and smooth, often reddish-barked trunk. The plant is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which has been used historically in traditional crafts and medicine. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in lowland forests or along riverbanks. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
