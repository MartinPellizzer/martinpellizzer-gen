    "intro": "Haemocarpus, commonly known as the blood grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive red or purple seed heads, which give it its common name. The plants typically grow in wetland and marshy areas, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. Haemocarpus species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Their botanical significance lies in their ecological role and potential use in phytoremediation."
