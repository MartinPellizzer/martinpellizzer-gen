    "intro": "Habenaria foetida, commonly known as the stinking orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, dark purple or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often near the forest floor. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a distinctive, foul-smelling odor to attract its pollinators. This orchid is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
