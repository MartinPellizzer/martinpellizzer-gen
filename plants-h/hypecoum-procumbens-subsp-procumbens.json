    "intro": "Hypecoum procumbens subsp. procumbens, commonly known as the creeping watercress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland and marshy areas. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to aquatic environments, allowing it to thrive in shallow water. It is often used in ornamental water gardens and as a natural water purifier."
