    "intro": "Hypolepis millefolium, commonly known as the common sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into numerous small, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are typically evergreen, providing a lush, green appearance throughout the year."
