    "intro": "Hura senegalensis, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to Africa and the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmate leaves. The tree produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, spiny capsules containing seeds. It is valued for its durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction, and for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife. Hura senegalensis is also used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
