It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically red or orange with a contrasting white or yellow base, giving it its varietal name. The plant has compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets and produces fleshy, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species.

The species is also noted for its ability to tolerate a range of soil types and its use in traditional medicine in some regions."
