    "intro": "Huodendron tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly alder, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescent foliage, which gives it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters, and it produces small, berry-like fruits. Huodendron tomentosum is often used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
