It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant thrives in moist environments, often found near water bodies such as lakes and streams. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
