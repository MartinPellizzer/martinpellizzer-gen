    "intro": "Hymenidium wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's hymenidium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a mild, spicy fragrance. Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
