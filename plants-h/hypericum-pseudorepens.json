    "intro": "Hypericum pseudorepens, commonly known as the creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has thin, sprawling stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas."
