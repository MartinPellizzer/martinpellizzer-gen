    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. integrilaterum, commonly known as the broad-leafed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow composite flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its broadly lanceolate leaves with smooth margins and a more robust growth habit compared to other hawkweed species. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. The plant is typically short-lived, with a lifespan of about three to five years."
