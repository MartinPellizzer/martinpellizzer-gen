    "intro": "Hieracium levicaule subsp. grophosoides, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers in composite flower heads, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Due to its low-growing form and ornamental potential, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
