    "intro": "Hyphaene welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia, is a unique plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia and Angola. It is characterized by its two large, paddle-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant has a thick, woody trunk and produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It is adapted to extreme arid conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to access underground water. Hyphaene welwitschii is considered a living fossil, with a lineage dating back over 100 million years."
