    "intro": "Hartogia acerosa, commonly known as the hardy rock cress, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its succulent leaves help it store water, making it drought-tolerant. Hartogia acerosa is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience."
