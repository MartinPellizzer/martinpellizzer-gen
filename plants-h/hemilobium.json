    "intro": "Hemilobium, commonly known as the false buttonweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive inflorescence, which consists of a single, spike-like cluster of flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy areas and is often found in the southeastern United States. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowers are small and inconspicuous. Hemilobium species are often considered weeds in wetland habitats due to their rapid growth and spread."
