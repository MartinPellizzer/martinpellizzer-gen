It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, wastelands, and along roadsides. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are rough to the touch, with a hairy texture. Its flowering stems bear yellow flowers in a single head, surrounded by pale green to brown bracts. This subspecies is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and is often distinguished from other Hieracium species by its specific morphological traits."
