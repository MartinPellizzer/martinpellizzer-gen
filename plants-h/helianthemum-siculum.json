    "intro": "Helianthemum siculum, commonly known as the Sicilian sunflower or rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 centimeters. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss.
