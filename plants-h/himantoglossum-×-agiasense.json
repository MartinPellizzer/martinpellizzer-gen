    "intro": "Himantoglossum \u00d7 agiasense, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is a hybrid between Himantoglossum haematochlaena and Himantoglossum \u00d7 hirsutum, exhibiting a combination of characteristics from both parent species. The plant produces showy, lip-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, which are adapted for specific pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland edges and meadows. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
