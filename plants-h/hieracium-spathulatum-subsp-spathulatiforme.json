    "intro": "Hieracium spathulatum subsp. spathulatiforme, commonly known as the broad-leaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, preferring temperate climates. Its leaves are broadly ovate to spatulate in shape, often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in dense inflorescences. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
