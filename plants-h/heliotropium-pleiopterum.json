    "intro": "Heliotropium pleiopterum, commonly known as the showy heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual or biennial herb, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and are known to open in response to light, a trait called heliotropism. The leaves are usually alternate, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
