    "intro": "Haloragis halconensis, commonly known as the Halconensis everlet, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a small shrub that typically grows in coastal and subalpine regions, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native environment. Haloragis halconensis is also notable for its role in supporting local insect populations and its adaptation to harsh, wind-swept conditions."
