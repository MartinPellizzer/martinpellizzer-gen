It features small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in spring. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. It is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in coastal and Mediterranean climates."
