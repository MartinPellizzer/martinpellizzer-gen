It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are usually purple or pink, with a distinctive yellow center, and it produces fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium pseudostenoplecum is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize various habitats."
