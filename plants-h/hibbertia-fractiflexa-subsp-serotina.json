    "intro": "Hibbertia fractiflexa subsp. serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering hibbertia, is a species native to southwestern Australia. It is a shrub characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, showy yellow flowers. The plant produces its flowers late in the growing season, typically from late autumn to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This subspecies is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
