    "intro": "Haplophyllum subcordatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rockrose, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for xeriscaping. Haplophyllum subcordatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
