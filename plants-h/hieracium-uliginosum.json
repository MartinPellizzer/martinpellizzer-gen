    "intro": "Hieracium uliginosum, commonly known as the bog thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright stems covered in coarse, hairy texture. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, known as a corymb, during the summer months. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Hieracium uliginosum is adapted to waterlogged soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
