    "intro": "Hymenolobus procumbens var. pauciflorus, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to sandy and rocky habitats in the western United States. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered with fine hairs to reduce water loss. This variant is distinguished by its reduced flower count compared to the typical form, a trait that may be an adaptation to its harsh, dry habitat."
