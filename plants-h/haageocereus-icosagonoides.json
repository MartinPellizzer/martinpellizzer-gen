    "intro": "Haageocereus icosagonoides, commonly known as the Desert Star Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in white, woolly spines, which help reduce water loss and provide insulation. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and moths. Its roots are shallow and adapted to absorb moisture from infrequent rains. Haageocereus icosagonoides is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun."
