    "intro": "Hieracium nervulosum var. ventosicum, commonly known as the wind-poor hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. Its leaves are basal and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. The flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, contributing to the plant's role in pollinator support in its native environment."
