    "intro": "Hesperis matronalis var. runcinata, commonly known as the scarlet pimpernel, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, bright yellow flowers with four petals. The flowers open in the morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty. This variety is distinguished by its slightly lobed and rounded leaf margins, giving it a more refined appearance compared to the typical Hesperis matronalis. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
