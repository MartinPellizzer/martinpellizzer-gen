    "intro": "Hippocrepis balearica subsp. eubalearica, commonly known as the Balearic bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively on the Balearic Islands. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in coastal or subalpine environments. Its small, lanceolate leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
