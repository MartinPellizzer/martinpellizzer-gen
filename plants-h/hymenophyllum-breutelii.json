    "intro": "Hymenophyllum breutelii, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, soft, and velvety fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and rocks without being parasitic. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a popular species among fern enthusiasts and botanists."
