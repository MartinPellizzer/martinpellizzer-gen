It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The subspecies is distinguished by its finely toothed, tridentate leaves, which give it its common name. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and is often found in temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
