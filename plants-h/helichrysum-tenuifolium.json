    "intro": "Helichrysum tenuifolium, commonly known as slenderleaf everlasting, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, bright yellow to orange flowers that are often retained on the plant long after blooming. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and long-lasting flowers make it a popular choice for dried flower arrangements. Helichrysum tenuifolium is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine."
