    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 flexile, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves and yellow flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. It produces seeds through achenes that are dispersed by wind, facilitating its spread. Hieracium \u00d7 flexile is often found in temperate regions of Europe and has been introduced to other parts of the world."
