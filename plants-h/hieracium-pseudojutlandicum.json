    "intro": "Hieracium pseudojutlandicum, commonly known as the Jutland hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to northern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. It produces yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer, and its leaves are usually alternate, rough, and covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
