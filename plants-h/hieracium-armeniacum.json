    "intro": "Hieracium armeniacum, commonly known as Armenian hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright stems and basal rosettes of leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey, it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
