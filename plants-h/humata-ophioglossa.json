    "intro": "Humata ophioglossa, commonly known as the lesser sword fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae, which is characterized by its primitive morphology and limited distribution. The plant has a distinctive, sword-shaped frond that is typically dark green and slightly glossy. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
