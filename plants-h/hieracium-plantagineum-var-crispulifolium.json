    "intro": "Hieracium plantagineum var. crispulifolium, commonly known as the curly-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are often curled or crinkled, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in some regions and can outcompete native plant species."
