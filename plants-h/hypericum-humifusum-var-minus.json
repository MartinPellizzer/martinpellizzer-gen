    "intro": "Hypericum humifusum var. minus, commonly known as lesser St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to North America. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has woody stems that remain close to the ground, and its leaves are opposite, with a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and open woodlands. This variant is distinguished by its smaller size and fewer flowers compared to the typical form of Hypericum humifusum."
