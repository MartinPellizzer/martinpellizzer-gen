    "intro": "Hedyotis nana, commonly known as dwarf mistletoe, is a small evergreen shrub native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. Its flowers are tiny, white or pale green, and it produces small, dark berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Hedyotis nana is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
