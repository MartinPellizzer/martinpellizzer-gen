    "intro": "Hypopitys monotropa subsp. hypophegea, commonly known as the red-berried ghostplant, is a rare and delicate plant native to parts of eastern North America. It is a member of the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves, instead having scale-like structures. The plant produces small, reddish berries that are an important food source for certain wildlife species. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as deciduous forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
