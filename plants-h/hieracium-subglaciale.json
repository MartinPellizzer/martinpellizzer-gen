    "intro": "Hieracium subglaciale, commonly known as the glacier hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cold, high-altitude environments where temperatures are low and sunlight is abundant. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a woolly texture, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Hieracium subglaciale plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
