    "intro": "Hieracium carestianum, commonly known as the Italian hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow ray florets and disc florets. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. It has a fibrous root system and produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
