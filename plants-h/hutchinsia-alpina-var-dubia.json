    "intro": "Hutchinsia alpina var. dubia, commonly known as the alpine hutchinsia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
