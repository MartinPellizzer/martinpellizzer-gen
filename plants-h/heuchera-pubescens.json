    "intro": "Heuchera pubescens, commonly known as the velvetleaf alumroot, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that range in color from deep maroon to silver-green, depending on the cultivar. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red during the spring. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental foliage and early blooming habit contribute to its value in both landscape design and ecological settings."
