    "intro": "Hakea petrophiloides, commonly known as the granite hakea, is a shrub native to the granite outcrops of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. The plant produces cylindrical, woody cones that contain numerous small, glossy seeds. It is adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often found in open habitats such as heathlands and rocky areas. Hakea petrophiloides plays an important ecological role in its native environment, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
