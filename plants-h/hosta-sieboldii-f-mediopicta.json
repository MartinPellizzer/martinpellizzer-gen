    "intro": "Hosta sieboldii f. mediopicta, commonly known as the Blue Moon Hosta, is a cultivar prized for its striking foliage. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves with a deep blue-green center and a lighter, almost silvery margin. The plant is native to Japan and is well-suited for shade gardens due to its tolerance of low light conditions. It produces small, fragrant white flowers in late summer, though these are less prominent than its ornamental leaves. This variety is relatively low maintenance and thrives in moist, well-drained soil."
