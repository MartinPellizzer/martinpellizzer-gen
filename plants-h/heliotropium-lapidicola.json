    "intro": "Heliotropium lapidicola, commonly known as the rock heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple and pink. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy leaves adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in xeriscapes."
