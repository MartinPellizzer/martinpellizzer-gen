It is a perennial shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it drought-tolerant. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
