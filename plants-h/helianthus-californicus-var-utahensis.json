    "intro": "Helianthus californicus var. utahensis, commonly known as the Utah sunflower, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellow, daisy-like flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across suitable areas. This variety is closely related to other sunflower species but is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and morphological traits."
