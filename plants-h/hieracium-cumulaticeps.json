    "intro": "Hieracium cumulaticeps, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a dense, clustered inflorescence. It is an herbaceous perennial that produces seeds through wind dispersal, contributing to its widespread distribution."
