    "intro": "Hypericum olympicum f. prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate St. John's wort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and its ability to form dense, ground-covering mats in garden settings."
