It typically grows in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves and produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with wavy margins and covered in fine hairs. It is characterized by its ability to form dense colonies, which can sometimes become invasive in certain environments."
