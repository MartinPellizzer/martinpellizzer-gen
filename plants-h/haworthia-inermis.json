    "intro": "Haworthia inermis, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a compact, succulent perennial native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, bluish-green leaves with distinctive white or yellowish markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers on slender stems during the growing season. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for dry environments. Haworthia inermis is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
