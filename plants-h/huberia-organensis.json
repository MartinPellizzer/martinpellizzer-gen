    "intro": "Huberia organensis, commonly known as the Organ Mountains hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a prominent central stigma. Its leaves are ovate and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Huberia organensis is often found growing in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in full sun conditions."
