    "intro": "Hieracium schmidtii subsp. creticum, commonly known as the Cretan hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in Crete. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering heads that produce yellow or orange disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to the arid and sunny conditions of its native habitat. It has small, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
