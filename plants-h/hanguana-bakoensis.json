    "intro": "Hanguana bakoensis, commonly known as the Bakoensis hanguana, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture from the air. Its leaves are elliptical with a smooth surface and a dark green color, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to habitat loss and limited study, it remains a poorly understood species within its ecosystem."
