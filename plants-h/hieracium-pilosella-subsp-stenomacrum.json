It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow composite flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter, more compact growth compared to other forms of Hieracium pilosella. It typically thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
