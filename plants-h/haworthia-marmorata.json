    "intro": "Haworthia marmorata, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, triangular leaves with distinctive white or pale green markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. It produces small, white flowers on tall stems during the summer months. Haworthia marmorata is popular as a low-maintenance indoor plant due to its compact size and unique appearance."
