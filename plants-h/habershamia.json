    "intro": "Habershamia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with a single, waxy white flower that resembles a ghostly figure. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It requires specific environmental conditions, including high humidity and filtered sunlight, to thrive. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Habershamia is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
