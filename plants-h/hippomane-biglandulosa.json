    "intro": "Hippomane biglandulosa, commonly known as the Caribbean beach palm, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feather-like leaves that grow in a fan shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in sandy soils near the coast and is well adapted to salt spray and wind. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often found in coastal ecosystems where it contributes to stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
