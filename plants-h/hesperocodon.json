    "intro": "Hesperocodon, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny leaves and showy, blue or violet flowers that bloom in the summer. Native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean, these plants are adapted to salty and windy environments. Hesperocodon species are often found in dunes and rocky shores, where they thrive in well-drained soils. Their ecological importance includes providing habitat and nectar for pollinators in coastal ecosystems."
