    "intro": "Harpagonella arizonica, commonly known as Arizona harpagonella, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments, showing adaptations to drought and heat. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Harpagonella arizonica is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
