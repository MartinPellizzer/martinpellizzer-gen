    "intro": "Hieracium glaucinum subsp. tintiae, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in rocky and gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in several European countries."
