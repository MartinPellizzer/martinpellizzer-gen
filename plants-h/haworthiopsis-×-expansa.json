    "intro": "Haworthiopsis \u00d7 expansa, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a hybrid succulent native to South Africa. It features striking, narrow, zebra-like stripes on its fleshy, blue-green leaves, which are arranged in a rosette formation. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in well-draining soil with minimal water. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers on short, leafless stems during the summer months. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and rockeries."
