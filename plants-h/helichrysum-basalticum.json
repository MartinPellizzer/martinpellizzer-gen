    "intro": "Helichrysum basalticum, commonly known as the basaltic immortelle, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that resemble small sunflowers. The plant is often found growing in rocky and well-drained soils, particularly in mountainous regions. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Helichrysum basalticum is also noted for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
