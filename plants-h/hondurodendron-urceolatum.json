    "intro": "Hondurodendron urceolatum, commonly known as the cup-shaped tree, is a unique species native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive cup-shaped or urn-like form, which gives it its common name. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range."
