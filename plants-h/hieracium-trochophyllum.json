    "intro": "Hieracium trochophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow composite flowers that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically has linear to lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and it thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Hieracium trochophyllum is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a common weed in various regions, though it plays a role in supporting pollinators."
