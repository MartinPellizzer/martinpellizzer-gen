It is a low-growing shrub with dense, compact foliage that is often covered in a white, powdery coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, showy white flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate floral display to rocky or coastal habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid or Mediterranean climates. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
