    "intro": "Hieracium hirsutissimum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are hairy and lance-shaped, while its flowers consist of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. It is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
