    "intro": "Hydrocotyle felipae, commonly known as the Mexican water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Central America. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has floating leaves that are palmately lobed, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Its roots are anchored in the substrate, and it produces small white flowers during the warmer months. Hydrocotyle felipae plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
