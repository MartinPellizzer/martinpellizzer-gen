    "intro": "Hedera colchica f. dentata, commonly known as the Colchic dentate ivy, is a variant of the Colchic ivy native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its distinctive lobed or toothed leaves, which give it its specific epithet \"dentata.\" The plant typically grows as a climbing or trailing vine, with dark green, serrated foliage that can reach lengths of up to several meters. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cooler, humid climates."
