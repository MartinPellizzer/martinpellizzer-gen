    "intro": "Hypolepis commutata, commonly known as the shield fern, is a tropical fern native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically divided into segments with a unique, overlapping pattern. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid conditions. Hypolepis commutata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right growing conditions."
