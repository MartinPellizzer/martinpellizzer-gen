    "intro": "Haplopappus villanuevae, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a taproot system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils by accessing deep water sources. Its inflorescence consists of a single flower head surrounded by bracts, and it relies on wind pollination. Haplopappus villanuevae is adapted to extreme environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
