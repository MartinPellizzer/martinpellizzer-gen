    "intro": "Hieracium laevigatum subsp. obatrescens, commonly known as the smooth hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its bright yellow ray florets and dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and roadsides. It has hairy stems and leaves that are often lobed, and it produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
