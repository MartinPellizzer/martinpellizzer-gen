    "intro": "Hieracium calcigenum, commonly known as the limestone hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, thriving in sunny, well-drained environments. The plant features a basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and the plant is known for its ability to colonize disturbed or barren areas. Hieracium calcigenum is often found in alpine or subalpine regions, where it contributes to the ecological stability of its habitat."
