    "intro": "Hordeum sativum subsp. hexastichon, commonly known as wild barley, is a wild grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and spike-like inflorescences composed of multiple rows of bracts. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-lobed, three-awned spikelets. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, fields, and riverbanks. This subspecies is an important wild relative of cultivated barley, contributing to genetic diversity and potential agricultural improvement."
