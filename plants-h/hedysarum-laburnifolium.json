    "intro": "Hedysarum laburnifolium, commonly known as the yellow peavine, is a deciduous leguminous plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnate with 9 to 15 pairs of oval-shaped leaflets, giving it a resemblance to laburnum. The plant produces striking yellow pea-like flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its fruits are legumes that mature into cylindrical pods containing several seeds. Hedysarum laburnifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
