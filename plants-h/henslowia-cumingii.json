    "intro": "Henslowia cumingii, commonly known as the Cuming's henslowia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep purple. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in cloud forest environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and sometimes branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Henslowia cumingii is considered an endangered species."
