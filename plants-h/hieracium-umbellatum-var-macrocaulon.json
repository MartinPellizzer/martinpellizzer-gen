    "intro": "Hieracium umbellatum var. macrocaulon, commonly known as the large-stemmed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Due to its robust growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it is considered a common but sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
