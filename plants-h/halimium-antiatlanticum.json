    "intro": "Halimium antiatlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula and parts of North Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or coastal environments, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant pink or white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Halimium antiatlanticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
