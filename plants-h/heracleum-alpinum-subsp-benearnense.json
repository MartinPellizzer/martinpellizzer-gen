    "intro": "Heracleum alpinum subsp. benearnense, commonly known as the Alpine cowparsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is a perennial herb characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, compound leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and rocky areas at high altitudes. Due to its tall stature and showy flowers, it is sometimes considered a decorative plant in alpine gardens."
