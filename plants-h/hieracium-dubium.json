    "intro": "Hieracium dubium, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with hairy stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often reddish in color. Its flowers are yellow and bloom from late spring to early autumn, producing small seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium dubium is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is considered a weed in some regions."
