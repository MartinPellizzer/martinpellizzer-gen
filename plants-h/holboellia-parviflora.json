    "intro": "Holboellia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered holboellia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
