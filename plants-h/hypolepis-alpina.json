    "intro": "Hypolepis alpina, commonly known as the alpine water fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests or high-altitude grasslands. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Hypolepis alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
