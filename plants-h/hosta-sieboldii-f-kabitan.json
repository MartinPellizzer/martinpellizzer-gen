    "intro": "Hosta sieboldii f. kabitan, commonly known as the Kabitan hosta, is a cultivar prized for its unique foliage. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves with a striking combination of deep green and silver-white variegation. The plant is native to Japan and is well-suited for shady garden environments. It produces small, fragrant white flowers in late summer, though these are less showy than the foliage. This variety is relatively low maintenance and thrives in moist, well-drained soil."
