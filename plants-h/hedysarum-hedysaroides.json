    "intro": "Hedysarum hedysaroides, commonly known as the yellow peavine, is a perennial legume native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its climbing habit, trifoliate leaves, and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, elliptical pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Hedysarum hedysaroides plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
