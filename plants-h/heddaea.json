    "intro": "Heddaea, commonly known as the mountain heather, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. These plants are typically shrubs characterized by their evergreen leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. Heddaea species are native to mountainous regions in Europe, Asia, and North America, where they thrive in acidic, well-drained soils. They often grow in rocky or forested areas, displaying a range of flower colors including white, pink, and purple. Heddaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
