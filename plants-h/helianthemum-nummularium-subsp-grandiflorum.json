    "intro": "Helianthemum nummularium subsp. grandiflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, often in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
