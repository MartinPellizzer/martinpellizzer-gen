    "intro": "Homalocarpus bowlesioides, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a rare and striking member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped fronds that are bright yellow to golden in color, giving it its common name. Its intricate, lace-like structure makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and botanical collections. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
