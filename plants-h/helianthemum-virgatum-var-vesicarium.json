    "intro": "Helianthemum virgatum var. vesicarium, commonly known as the vesicating sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, typically from April to June. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or open grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
