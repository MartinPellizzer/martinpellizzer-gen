    "intro": "Hemianemia eximia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a rare and highly valued tree species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, reddish-brown heartwood, which is prized for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it particularly vulnerable to overharvesting. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a leathery texture, while its flowers are small and clustered. Due to habitat loss and unsustainable logging, Hemianemia eximia is now classified as critically endangered by conservation organizations."
