    "intro": "Helichrysum prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate immortelle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features small, golden-yellow flower heads that are often used in floral arrangements due to their longevity and vibrant color. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern near the ground. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its name \"immortelle\" refers to the dried flower heads' ability to retain their color for extended periods."
