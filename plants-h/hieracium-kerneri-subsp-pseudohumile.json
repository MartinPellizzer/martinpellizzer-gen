    "intro": "Hieracium kerneri subsp. pseudohumile, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes. The plant has basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. It is characterized by its compact growth form and is often found in mountainous areas with poor soil. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
