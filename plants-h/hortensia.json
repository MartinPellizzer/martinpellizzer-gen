    "intro": "Hortensia, commonly known as hydrangea, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Hydrangaceae. It is characterized by its showy, rounded flower clusters that can range in color from white to pink, blue, or purple, depending on soil pH. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, with large, heart-shaped leaves that are often serrated. Hortensias thrive in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making them popular in gardens and landscapes. They are widely cultivated for their ornamental value and are often used in floral arrangements."
