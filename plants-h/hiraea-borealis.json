    "intro": "Hiraea borealis, commonly known as the Arctic hiraea, is a small flowering plant native to the Arctic tundra. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its polar habitat. Hiraea borealis plays a minor but important role in the tundra ecosystem, providing food for various insects and small herbivores."
