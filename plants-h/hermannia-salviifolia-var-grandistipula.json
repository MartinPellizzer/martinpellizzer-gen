    "intro": "Hermannia salviifolia var. grandistipula, commonly known as the large-tipped hermannia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged oppositely along the stems. This variant is distinguished by its notably elongated bracts, which give it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
