    "intro": "Hieracium aspratile, commonly known as the rough hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to Europe, it is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It is considered a weed in some agricultural areas due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
