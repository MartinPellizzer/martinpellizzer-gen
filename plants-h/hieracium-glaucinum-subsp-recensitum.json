    "intro": "Hieracium glaucinum subsp. recensitum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, silver-haired leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. It is characterized by its small stature and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
