    "intro": "Hydrocotyle grammatocarpa, commonly known as the Florida waterpennywort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant has floating leaves that are broadly ovate with a waxy surface, and it produces small, white flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats on the water surface. Hydrocotyle grammatocarpa plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
