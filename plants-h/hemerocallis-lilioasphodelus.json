    "intro": "Hemerocallis lilioasphodelus, commonly known as the marsh daylily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist soils in North America. It features upright, sword-shaped leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant blooms in late spring to early summer, with each flower lasting only one day, hence its common name. It is drought-tolerant once established and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The marsh daylily is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
