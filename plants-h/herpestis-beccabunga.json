    "intro": "Herpestis beccabunga, commonly known as the water dropwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often along the edges of ponds, streams, and marshes. The plant has slender, hollow stems that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a slight waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant is valued for its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic habitats and is sometimes used in phytoremediation efforts."
