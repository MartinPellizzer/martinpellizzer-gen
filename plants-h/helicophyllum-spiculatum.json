    "intro": "Helicophyllum spiculatum, commonly known as the spiky helicophyllum, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its distinctive, branched structure. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, spiky leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white or yellowish flowers are clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is often used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
