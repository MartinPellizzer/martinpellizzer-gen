    "intro": "Helianthemum apenninum f. stoechadifolium, commonly known as the Stoechadifolium form of the Alpina rose, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, upright stems covered in dense clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand the harsh, rocky environments where it thrives. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils. It is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
