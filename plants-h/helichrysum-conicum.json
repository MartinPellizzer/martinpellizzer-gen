    "intro": "Helichrysum conicum, commonly known as the golden helmet, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, compact growth with narrow, needle-like leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, giving it a striking, ornamental appearance. It is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal areas due to its drought tolerance and salt resistance. Helichrysum conicum is also valued for its aromatic foliage and ability to thrive in poor soils."
