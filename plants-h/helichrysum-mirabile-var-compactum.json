    "intro": "Helichrysum mirabile var. compactum, commonly known as the compact golden everlasting, is a low-growing shrub native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, yellowish to golden-orange flowers that are highly ornamental and retain their color when dried. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its compact growth habit and long-lasting flowers make it a popular choice for both ornamental and dried floral arrangements."
