    "intro": "Hypochaeris candollei, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the spring and summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Hypochaeris candollei is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
