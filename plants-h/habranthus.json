    "intro": "Habranthus, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. These plants are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are characterized by their small, grass-like leaves and striking blue or violet flowers. Habranthus species typically grow in wetland or marshy habitats, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The flowers are usually clustered in dense inflorescences and bloom during the wet season. Due to their unique appearance and ecological significance, some species of Habranthus are of interest to botanists and conservationists."
