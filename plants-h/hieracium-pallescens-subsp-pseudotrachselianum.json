    "intro": "Hieracium pallescens subsp. pseudotrachselianum, commonly known as the pale hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It has slender, hairy stems and produces small, inconspicuous florets in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
