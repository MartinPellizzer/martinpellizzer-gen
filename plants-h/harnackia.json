    "intro": "Harnackia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking, spiky blue or purple flowers that resemble sea urchins, hence its common name. The plants typically grow in coastal areas and are adapted to salty, windy environments. Harnackia species have narrow, grass-like leaves and are often found in sandy or rocky soils. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging coastal conditions."
