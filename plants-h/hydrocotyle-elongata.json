    "intro": "Hydrocotyle elongata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water shield, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, floating leaves that are usually less than 2 inches in diameter, with a waxy surface that helps it stay afloat. Its small white flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are dispersed by water. Hydrocotyle elongata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
