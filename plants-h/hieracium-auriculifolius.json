    "intro": "Hieracium auriculifolius, commonly known as the auriculate hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, with basal leaves that are broadly ovate and often have auriculate (ear-like) lobes at the base. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
