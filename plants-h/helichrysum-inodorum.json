    "intro": "Helichrysum inodorum, commonly known as the everlasting daisy, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its small, daisy-like yellow flowers that are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. The plant produces small, rounded seed heads that remain on the plant for an extended period, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Helichrysum inodorum is also valued for its aromatic foliage, which emits a subtle, spicy scent."
