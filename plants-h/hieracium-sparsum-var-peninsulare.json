    "intro": "Hieracium sparsum var. peninsulare, commonly known as the coastal hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its yellow daisy-like flowers and hairy, often reddish stems. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and dunes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
