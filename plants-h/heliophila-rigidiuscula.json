    "intro": "Heliophila rigidiuscula, commonly known as the rigid water plantain, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in dense clusters around the base. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in still or slow-moving water bodies. Heliophila rigidiuscula is an important component of aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
