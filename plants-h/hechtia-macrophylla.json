    "intro": "Hechtia macrophylla, commonly known as the giant hechtia, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to Mexico. It is characterized by its large, broad, dark green leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, forming a rosette shape. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, adding visual interest. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hechtia macrophylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
