    "intro": "Helianthemum brachypodum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, upright stems covered in fine, silver-gray hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, adding a bright splash of color to rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to withstand drought and intense sunlight. Helianthemum brachypodum is often found in coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience."
