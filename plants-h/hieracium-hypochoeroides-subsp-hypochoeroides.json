    "intro": "Hieracium hypochoeroides subsp. hypochoeroides, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in grassy meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant has basal and upright stems, with alternate, lanceolate leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are yellow, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and are produced from late spring to early autumn. It is characterized by its finely divided leaves and is often mistaken for other hawkweed species due to its similar appearance."
