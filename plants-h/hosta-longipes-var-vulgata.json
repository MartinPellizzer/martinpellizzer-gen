    "intro": "Hosta longipes var. vulgata, commonly known as the giant hosta, is a varietal form of the hosta plant native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, dark green leaves that can grow up to 30 inches in length. The plant produces showy, fragrant, white to pale blue flowers on tall, upright stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vigorous growth and ability to form dense clumps over time."
