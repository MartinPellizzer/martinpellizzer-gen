    "intro": "Habenaria uhehensis, commonly known as the Uheh Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Africa, particularly Uganda and Tanzania. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a raceme, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
