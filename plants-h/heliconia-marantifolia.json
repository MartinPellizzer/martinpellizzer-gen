    "intro": "Heliconia marantifolia, commonly known as the flame banana, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Heliconiaceae family and is characterized by its large, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often used in floral arrangements due to their vibrant hues. Its leaves are broad, glossy, and often arranged in a spiral pattern, contributing to its ornamental value. Heliconia marantifolia thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and as a houseplant."
