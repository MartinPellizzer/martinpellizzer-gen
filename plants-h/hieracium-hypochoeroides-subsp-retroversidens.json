    "intro": "Hieracium hypochoeroides subsp. retroversidens, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. The plant features basal rosettes of leaves that are lanceolate and often covered with fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a single head, with ray florets that curve backward, giving it its subspecies name. It has a fibrous root system and produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind."
