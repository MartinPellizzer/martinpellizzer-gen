It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and clusters of waxy, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The leaves are typically ovate to heart-shaped, with a smooth, glossy surface. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular among houseplant enthusiasts due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
