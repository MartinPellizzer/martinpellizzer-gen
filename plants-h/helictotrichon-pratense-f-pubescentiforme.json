    "intro": "Helictotrichon pratense f. pubescentiforme, commonly known as the pubescent form of meadow hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant characterized by its distinctive hairy foliage and inflorescence. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. The plant features basal rosettes of leaves that are densely covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family, and bloom during the summer months. This variant is often found in meadows and grassy areas, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
