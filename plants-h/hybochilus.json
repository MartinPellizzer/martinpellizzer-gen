    "intro": "Hybochilus, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. These plants are native to wetland habitats in North America, where they thrive in moist to waterlogged soils. Hybochilus species are characterized by their showy, often pink or red flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are usually opposite and oval-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. They play an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
