    "intro": "Hieracium leucothyrsum, commonly known as the white-hairy hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
