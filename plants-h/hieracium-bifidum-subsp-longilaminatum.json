    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. longilaminatum, commonly known as the long-leaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly lanceolate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf shape and size."
