    "intro": "Hippeophyllum pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf milkweed, is a small shrub native to the western United States. It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which attract various pollinators. Its latex sap is milky and contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to some animals. Hippeophyllum pumilum is often found in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun."
