    "intro": "Hymenophyllum malcolm-smithii, commonly known as the Malcolm-Smith's haircap, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called soridia, are borne on the undersides of the leaves. This species is notable for its intricate leaf venation and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
