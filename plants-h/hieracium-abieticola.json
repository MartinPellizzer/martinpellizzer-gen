    "intro": "Hieracium abieticola, commonly known as the subalpine hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the daisy family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellowish to orange-red flowers and hairy, rough-textured leaves. This perennial herb typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often on rocky soils and in open meadows. It has a low-growing habit and produces small, bract-like leaves that help it survive in cold, harsh environments. The plant is adapted to high-altitude conditions and is often found in regions with limited soil nutrients."
