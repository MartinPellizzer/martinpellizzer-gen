    "intro": "Habenaria plantaginea, commonly known as the common marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip, which are typically arranged in a loose raceme. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
