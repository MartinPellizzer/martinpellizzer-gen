It is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered with fine hairs. Hieracium opetiophyllum is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
