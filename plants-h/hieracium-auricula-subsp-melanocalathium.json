    "intro": "Hieracium auricula subsp. melanocalathium, commonly known as the black-veined hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers and hairy, rough stems. The subspecies is distinguished by its dark, almost black veins on the leaves, which give it its common name. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and woodland edges. The plant produces small, oval-shaped achenes as its seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
