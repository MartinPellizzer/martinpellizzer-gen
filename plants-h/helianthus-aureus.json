    "intro": "Helianthus aureus, commonly known as the sunflower, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flower heads surrounded by green, leafy foliage. The plant is native to North America and is often found in prairies, meadows, and disturbed soils. Its scientific name reflects its golden yellow flowers, and it is known for its heliotropic behavior, where the flower head follows the sun's movement during the day. Helianthus aureus is also valued for its ornamental beauty and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
