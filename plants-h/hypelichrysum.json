It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces small, papery bracts that give it a fluffy appearance, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Hypelichrysum is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
