    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. subirriguiforme, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in the summer months. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. It has a creeping growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes to form new plants. Its botanical features make it a common weed in disturbed soils and a subject of study in ecological and botanical research."
