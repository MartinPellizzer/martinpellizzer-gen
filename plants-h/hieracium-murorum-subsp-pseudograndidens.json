    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. pseudograndidens, commonly known as the rough hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and leafy stems. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, and it has hairy, often glandular leaves. Its flowers are yellow, with ray florets that are usually shorter than the central disk florets. The subspecies is distinguished by its robust growth and slightly different leaf morphology compared to other Hieracium species."
