    "intro": "Haplopappus diffusus, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, a common adaptation in desert flora. Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with similar composite flower structures."
