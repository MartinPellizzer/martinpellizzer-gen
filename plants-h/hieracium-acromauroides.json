    "intro": "Hieracium acromauroides, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine and subalpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves and produces yellow flowers in late summer. Its flowering stems are usually hairy and can reach heights of up to 30 centimeters. Hieracium acromauroides is characterized by its ability to form dense colonies, which can sometimes become invasive in its native habitats."
