    "intro": "Hydnora gigantea, commonly known as the giant hydnora, is a parasitic plant native to southern Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis, relying entirely on its host plant for nutrients. The plant produces a distinctive, fleshy, reddish-purple flower that emits a strong odor to attract pollinators. Its structure is simple, with no true leaves or stems, and it grows underground or within the host's tissue. The flower opens at night, and its unique morphology makes it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
