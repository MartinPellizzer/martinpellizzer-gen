    "intro": "Heliophila sarcophylla, commonly known as the sun-loving leaf plant, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hydrocharitaceae and is characterized by its submerged or floating aquatic growth habit. The plant features narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically green and often have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which bloom during the warmer months. Heliophila sarcophylla is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes."
