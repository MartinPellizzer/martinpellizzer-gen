    "intro": "Haloragis laevis, commonly known as the smooth waterwheel, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the Haloragaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as streams and lakes, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich substrates. Its leaves are smooth and lance-shaped, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates. Haloragis laevis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize riverbanks and improve water quality."
