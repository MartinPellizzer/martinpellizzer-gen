    "intro": "Heteropappus ringens, commonly known as the desert fleabane, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Its yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and it produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Heteropappus ringens is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
