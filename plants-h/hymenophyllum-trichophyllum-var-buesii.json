    "intro": "Hymenophyllum trichophyllum var. buesii, commonly known as the Buesii fern, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in shaded, moist environments. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant has a unique structure with small, scale-like leaves that help it retain moisture in humid conditions. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions."
