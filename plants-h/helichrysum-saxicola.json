    "intro": "Helichrysum saxicola, commonly known as the rock everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often mistaken for leaves, giving it a unique appearance. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Helichrysum saxicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
