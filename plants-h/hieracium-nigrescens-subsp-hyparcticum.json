    "intro": "Hieracium nigrescens subsp. hyparcticum, commonly known as the northern hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with basal leaves that are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the genus Hieracium. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
