    "intro": "Homalium fallax, commonly known as the variable flame tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its striking, clustered inflorescences that resemble flames. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers surrounded by brightly colored bracts, which are often the primary attraction. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a leathery texture with a glossy surface. Homalium fallax thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical gardens."
