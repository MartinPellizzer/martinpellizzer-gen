    "intro": "Hieracium hyalinellum, commonly known as the glassy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, often reddish stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, whitish hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
