    "intro": "Helianthemum hyssopifolium, commonly known as the woolly rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, typically clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant has gray-green, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hirsute foliage and showy flowers make it an attractive and drought-tolerant addition to Mediterranean gardens."
