    "intro": "Hymenophyllum hemipteron, commonly known as the narrow-leaf haircap, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rock crevices, where it thrives in high humidity. Its fronds are usually less than 10 centimeters in length, and the sporangia are clustered in small, circular groups called sori. The plant's unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an important component of tropical and subtropical ecosystems."
