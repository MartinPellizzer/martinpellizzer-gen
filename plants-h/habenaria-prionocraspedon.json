    "intro": "Habenaria prionocraspedon, commonly known as the narrow-lobed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a loose raceme, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in the orchid family's evolutionary diversity."
