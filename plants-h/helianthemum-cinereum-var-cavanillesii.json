    "intro": "Helianthemum cinereum var. cavanillesii, commonly known as the Cavanilles' rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, evergreen leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to full sun exposure. This variety is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
