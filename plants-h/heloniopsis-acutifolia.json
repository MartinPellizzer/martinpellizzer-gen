    "intro": "Heloniopsis acutifolia, commonly known as the sharpleaf heloniopsis, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in Mediterranean-style gardens."
