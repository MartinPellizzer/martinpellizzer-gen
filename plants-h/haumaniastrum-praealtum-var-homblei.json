    "intro": "Haumaniastrum praealtum var. homblei, commonly known as the Hohlenstein's thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, silver-green leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
