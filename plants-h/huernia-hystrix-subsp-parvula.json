It features a compact, rounded stem covered in dense, white to pale green tubercles. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
