    "intro": "Helichrysum globiferum, commonly known as the globular everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of golden-yellow flowers that resemble small globes, giving it its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, papery bracts that persist after the flowers have faded. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in dried flower arrangements."
