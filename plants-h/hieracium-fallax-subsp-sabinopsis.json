It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers in late summer, which are composed of numerous small florets. It thrives in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its habitat."
