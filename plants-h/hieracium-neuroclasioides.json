    "intro": "Hieracium neuroclasioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring temperate climates. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
