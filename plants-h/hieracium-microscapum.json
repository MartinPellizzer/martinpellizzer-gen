    "intro": "Hieracium microscapum, commonly known as the small-stemmed hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It has small, often inconspicuous flowers that are yellow to reddish in color, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped with rough textures. Due to its low-growing habit and modest appearance, it is often overlooked despite its ecological significance in supporting pollinators."
