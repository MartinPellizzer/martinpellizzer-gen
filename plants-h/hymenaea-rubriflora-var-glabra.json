    "intro": "Hymenaea rubriflora var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth rosewood tree, is a tropical species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, compound leaves with serrated margins. The tree produces showy, red-orange flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, elliptical seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, though it is also used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
