    "intro": "Hymenophyllum micans, commonly known as the silver fern, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are covered in a fine layer of silvery hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant belongs to the Hymenophyllaceae family and is known for its small, sporangia that are clustered in dense, circular formations called sori. It is typically found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, Hymenophyllum micans is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
