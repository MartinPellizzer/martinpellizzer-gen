    "intro": "Hexactina corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered star coral. This marine plant is a type of coral that forms dense, bushy colonies in shallow tropical waters. It is characterized by its branching structure and small, calcareous polyps that contribute to its reef-building capabilities. The coral thrives in warm, clear waters with moderate light exposure. Its growth pattern and skeletal structure make it an important component of coral reef ecosystems."
