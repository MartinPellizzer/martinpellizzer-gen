It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, followed by narrow, curved pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Hedysarum campylocarpon is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for wildlife."
