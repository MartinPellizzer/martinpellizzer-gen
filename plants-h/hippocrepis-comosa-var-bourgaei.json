    "intro": "Hippocrepis comosa var. bourgaei, commonly known as the Bourgae's helmet orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive helmet-shaped flower, which is typically a deep violet or purple color. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, fragrant blossoms that bloom in late spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
