    "intro": "Homalachna, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family. It is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. The plant is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer. Its fruit is a poisonous berry that contains alkaloids, making it toxic to both humans and animals. Due to its ornamental value and toxic properties, it is often cultivated in gardens with caution."
