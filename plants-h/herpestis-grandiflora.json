    "intro": "Herpestis grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered hogweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, umbrella-like clusters of white to pinkish flowers. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
