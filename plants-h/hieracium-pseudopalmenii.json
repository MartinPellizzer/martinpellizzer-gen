    "intro": "Hieracium pseudopalmenii, commonly known as the false palmleaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
