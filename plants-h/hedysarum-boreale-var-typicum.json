    "intro": "Hedysarum boreale var. typicum, commonly known as the northern vetch, is a perennial legume native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and along riverbanks. The plant produces slender, erect stems with trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. Hedysarum boreale var. typicum plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
