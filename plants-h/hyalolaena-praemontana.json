It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that are typically pale green or white. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, a feature that helps it survive in its arid habitat. Hyalolaena praemontana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
