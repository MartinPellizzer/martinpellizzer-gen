    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. macrophyllopodum, commonly known as the large-leaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of large, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellowish to orange composite flowers that bloom in summer, typically from June to August. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
