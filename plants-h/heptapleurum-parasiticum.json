    "intro": "Heptapleurum parasiticum, commonly known as the parasitic heptapleurum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it can photosynthesize but also derives some of its nutrients from host plants. The plant typically grows as a shrub, with dark green, leathery leaves that are opposite or whorled in arrangement. Its flowers are small and usually white or pink, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. It is native to regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments."
