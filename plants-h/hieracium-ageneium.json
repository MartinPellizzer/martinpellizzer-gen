    "intro": "Hieracium ageneium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and basal leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that are typically arranged in a single head, with ray florets surrounding a central disk. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
