It features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Due to its attractive appearance and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a decorative plant."
