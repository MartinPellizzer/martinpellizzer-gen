It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with a distinct, elongated central stem. It plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations due to its nectar-rich blooms."
