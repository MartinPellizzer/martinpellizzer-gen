    "intro": "Heliotropium ruhanyi, commonly known as the Ruhanyi's heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of small, pink or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in savanna or woodland habitats. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty, which may aid in pollination by diurnal insects. The plant is also noted for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
