    "intro": "Hoyella, commonly known as the Christmas cactus, is a tropical plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the genus Schlumbergera and is characterized by its segmented, leaf-like stems that bear vibrant flowers. The plant typically blooms during the holiday season, producing clusters of showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. Hoyella thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and seasonal blooming make it a popular houseplant during the winter months."
