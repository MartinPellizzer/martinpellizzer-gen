It is characterized by its bright yellow ray florets and dark green, hairy leaves. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces small, spiky seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal. It is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators."
