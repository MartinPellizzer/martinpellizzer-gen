    "intro": "Humboltia sclerophylla, commonly known as the coastal sycamore, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in its arid and coastal habitats. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Humboltia sclerophylla typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters, and is often found in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various local wildlife species."
