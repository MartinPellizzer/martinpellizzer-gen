    "intro": "Hieracium subobatrescens, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in grassy areas and disturbed soils. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural landscapes."
