    "intro": "Handeliodendron, commonly known as the Chinese catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The tree produces long, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Handeliodendron is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can grow up to 20 meters tall in its natural habitat. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological and horticultural study."
