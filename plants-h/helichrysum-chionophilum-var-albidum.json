    "intro": "Helichrysum chionophilum var. albidum, commonly known as the white everlasting, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its inflorescences consist of numerous tiny, daisy-like flowers arranged in compact clusters. This species is often used in rock gardens and as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
