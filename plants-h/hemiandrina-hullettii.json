    "intro": "Hemiandrina hullettii, commonly known as the Hallett's hemiandrina, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant has a shrub-like growth habit with woody stems and palmate leaves that are often hairy in texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
