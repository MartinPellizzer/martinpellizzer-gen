    "intro": "Huperzia edanoi, commonly known as the Mexican huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its simple, linear leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant is native to Mexico and parts of Central America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Huperzia edanoi is notable for its ability to retain water, which helps it survive in its natural habitat. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, a typical feature of ferns."
