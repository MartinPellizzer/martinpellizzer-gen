    "intro": "Hugonia viscosa, commonly known as sticky hugonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 1 meter, featuring upright stems covered in a sticky, resinous substance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough or hairy texture. Hugonia viscosa is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
