It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with distinctive four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are small, yellowish-white, and bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
