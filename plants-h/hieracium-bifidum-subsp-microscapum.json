It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster. This subspecies is distinguished by its relatively short, narrow stems and smaller flower heads compared to other members of the species."
