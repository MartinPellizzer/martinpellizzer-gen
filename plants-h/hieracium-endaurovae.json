It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It features basal rosettes of serrated, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
