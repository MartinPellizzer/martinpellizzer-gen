    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium f. atropurpureum, commonly known as purple cow parsley, is a flowering plant characterized by its distinctive purple-tinged leaves and umbel-shaped flower clusters. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are finely divided and have a mild, parsley-like scent when crushed. The flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer, are white or pale green, with a slight purple hue at the base."
