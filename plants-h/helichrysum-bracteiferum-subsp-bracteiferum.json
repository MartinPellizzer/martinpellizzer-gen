    "intro": "Helichrysum bracteiferum subsp. bracteiferum, commonly known as the golden cup plant, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of bright yellow, sun-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, silvery-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting flowers, which retain their color even when dried."
