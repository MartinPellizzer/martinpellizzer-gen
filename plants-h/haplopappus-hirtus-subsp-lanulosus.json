    "intro": "Haplopappus hirtus subsp. lanulosus, commonly known as the woolly goldenweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in clusters. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its inflorescence consists of a single, elongated head of florets, with bracts that are covered in fine, woolly hairs. The species is notable for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments."
