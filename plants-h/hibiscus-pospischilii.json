    "intro": "Hibiscus pospischilii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, large, velvety petals that range in color from deep red to orange and yellow. The plant has a sturdy, shrub-like structure with thick, waxy leaves adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Its flowers bloom in summer and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. Hibiscus pospischilii is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
