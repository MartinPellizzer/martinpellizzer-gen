    "intro": "Hedysarum carnosum, commonly known as the woolly vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, sprawling stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Hedysarum carnosum has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility in agricultural settings."
