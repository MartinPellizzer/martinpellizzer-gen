    "intro": "Himantochilus seretii, commonly known as the Malayan orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant prefers warm, humid environments and is often found in lowland forest areas. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of trees rather than in soil. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
