    "intro": "Hecistopteris minima, commonly known as the small fern of the genus Hecistopteris, is a prehistoric plant belonging to the order Psilotales. It is characterized by its simple, dichotomous branching pattern and lack of true roots, stems, and leaves. Fossil records indicate that it thrived during the Carboniferous period, contributing to the dense, swampy forests of that era. The plant's reproductive structures are preserved in coal balls, offering insights into its morphology and ecology. Its study helps scientists understand the evolution of early vascular plants and their ecological roles in ancient ecosystems."
