    "intro": "Helenium glomeratum, commonly known as the clustered helenium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, orange to red flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps and marshes, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly rough texture, while its stems are usually hairy. Helenium glomeratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
