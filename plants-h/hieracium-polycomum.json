    "intro": "Hieracium polycomum, commonly known as the many-flowered hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its flowers are yellow and appear in clusters, and it produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. The leaves are usually hairy and have a serrated edge, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
