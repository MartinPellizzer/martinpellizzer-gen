    "intro": "Hypericum insulare, commonly known as the coastal gold or seaside hypericum, is a low-growing shrub native to coastal areas of North America. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of tidal zones. Hypericum insulare is well adapted to salty air and wind exposure, making it a hardy plant in coastal environments."
