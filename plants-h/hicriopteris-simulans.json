    "intro": "Hicriopteris simulans, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arranged in a bipinnate pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds. Hicriopteris simulans plays an important role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
