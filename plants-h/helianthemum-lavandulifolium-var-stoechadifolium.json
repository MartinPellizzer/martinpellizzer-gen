    "intro": "Helianthemum lavandulifolium var. stoechadifolium, commonly known as the Scottish heath geranium, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Scottish Highlands. It features compact, rounded growth with small, dark green leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale pink to mauve flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal and moorland environments. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in challenging, wind-swept conditions."
