    "intro": "Heliocauta, commonly known as the sunflower, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy composite flower head that resembles a single flower, composed of many tiny florets. The plant is native to North America and is known for its heliotropic behavior, where the flower head follows the sun across the sky during the day. Heliocauta has a robust stem with rough, hairy leaves that are alternate and lance-shaped. It produces seeds in a distinctive disk-like structure, which are often referred to as sunflower seeds."
