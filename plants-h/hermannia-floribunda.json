    "intro": "Hermannia floribunda, commonly known as the African violet, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features compact, upright stems with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Hermannia floribunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of care, though it requires careful attention to watering and light conditions."
