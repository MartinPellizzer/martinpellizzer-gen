    "intro": "Hedysarum canadense, commonly known as Canada milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor conditions. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil."
