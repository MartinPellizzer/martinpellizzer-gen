    "intro": "Helianthus saxicola, commonly known as the rock sunflower, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Helianthus saxicola is adapted to full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping."
