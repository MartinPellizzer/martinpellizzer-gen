    "intro": "Hybanthus parviflorus var. glutinosus, commonly known as the sticky hybanthus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are often covered in a sticky substance, which may aid in pollination by attracting specific insects. The plant typically grows as a shrub or vine, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral morphology and ecological adaptations."
