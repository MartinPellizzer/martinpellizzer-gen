    "intro": "Hydnophytum terrestris, commonly known as the ground ivy or creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a unique ability to form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing its growth in nutrient-poor soils. Its rhizomatous stems allow it to spread rapidly, often forming dense mats on the ground. Hydnophytum terrestris is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands."
