    "intro": "Hymenaea obtusifolia, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a large tropical tree native to South America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets. The tree produces large, woody pods that contain the edible Brazil nuts. Its flowers are small and yellowish, and it is a dioecious species, meaning male and female flowers are found on separate trees. The plant is valued not only for its nuts but also for its role in biodiversity and ecological balance in its native habitat."
