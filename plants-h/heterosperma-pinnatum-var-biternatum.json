    "intro": "Heterosperma pinnatum var. biternatum, commonly known as the three-parted water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Heterosperma. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnate leaves that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can anchor itself to substrates. Its leaves are often submerged, with some emergent portions that can be used for identification. The species is noted for its adaptability to varying water conditions and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
