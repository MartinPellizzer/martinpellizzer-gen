    "intro": "Hoya obovata var. kerrii, commonly known as the Kerri's wax plant, is a compact, epiphytic succulent native to Southeast Asia. It features thick, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
