It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as mesic forests and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from invasive plants and habitat loss. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and preserve this unique botanical species."
