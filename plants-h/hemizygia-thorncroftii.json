It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with woody stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptability to harsh, dry environments makes it a resilient species in its native habitat. The plant's unique morphology and ecological role contribute to its significance in local ecosystems."
