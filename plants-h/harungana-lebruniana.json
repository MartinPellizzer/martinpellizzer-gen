    "intro": "Harungana lebruniana, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, providing a striking visual contrast against its green foliage. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are usually arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Harungana lebruniana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
