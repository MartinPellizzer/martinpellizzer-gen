    "intro": "Heteropterys laurifolia var. antillana, commonly known as the Antillean laurifolia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean region. It is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by round, fleshy berries containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests and wetlands. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in tropical and subtropical gardens."
