    "intro": "Heliotropium europaeum var. hispidula, commonly known as the European heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing herbaceous perennial with hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, often appearing in late summer to early autumn. Its flowers have a mild, sweet scent, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides."
