    "intro": "Hepetis dietrichiana, commonly known as the Dietrich's liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Peltasporaceae. It is a small, leafy liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, meaning it lacks true stems and leaves, and instead has a flat, ribbon-like body covered in tiny, scale-like structures. Its reproductive structures, called gametophores, are often clustered near the base of the thallus. Hepetis dietrichiana is characterized by its distinctive arrangement of leaf-like lobes and its ability to thrive in humid, nutrient-rich substrates."
