    "intro": "Hohenbergia brachycephala, commonly known as the compact bracts hohenbergia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a thick layer of white powdery wax. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with bright red bracts that contrast beautifully with its dark green foliage. It is a compact plant, typically growing to a height of around 10 to 15 centimeters, making it ideal for small spaces. Hohenbergia brachycephala is relatively easy to care for, requiring bright indirect light and moderate watering."
