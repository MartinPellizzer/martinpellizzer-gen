    "intro": "Hyacinthus angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features strap-shaped, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early blooming period and compact growth habit."
