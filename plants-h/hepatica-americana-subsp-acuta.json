It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmately divided leaves that are typically hairy. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in shaded, rocky soils. The subspecies acuta is distinguished by its more sharply pointed leaf lobes compared to other hepatica varieties."
