    "intro": "Helichrysum aretioides, commonly known as the golden marguerite, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of bright yellow, daisy-like flowers. The plant features narrow, grey-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. The flowers are long-lasting and often retain their color even when dried, which contributes to its use in floral arrangements."
