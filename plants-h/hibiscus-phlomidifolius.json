    "intro": "Hibiscus phlomidifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant thrives in humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Hibiscus phlomidifolius is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with multiple stems and a spreading or upright form depending on the cultivar."
