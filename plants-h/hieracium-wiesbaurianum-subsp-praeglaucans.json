    "intro": "Hieracium wiesbaurianum subsp. praeglaucans, commonly known as the Wiesbaur's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellowish to reddish flowering heads. The subspecies is distinguished by its glaucous (bluish-green) leaves and relatively small, compact inflorescences. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in parts of its range."
