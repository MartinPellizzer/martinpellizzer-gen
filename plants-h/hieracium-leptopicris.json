It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, and it has a creeping rhizome that helps it spread vegetatively.
