    "intro": "Heracleum spathiphyllum, commonly known as cow parsnip, is a tall biennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features a thick, ridged stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a purple or red tinge at the base. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. Its sap contains phototoxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. It is often found in moist meadows, stream banks, and forest edges."
