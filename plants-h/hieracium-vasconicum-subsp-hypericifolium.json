    "intro": "Hieracium vasconicum subsp. hypericifolium, commonly known as the Pyrenean hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrowly lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellowish to orange flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the genus Hieracium. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within its range."
