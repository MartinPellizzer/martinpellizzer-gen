It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in summer, while its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. It is considered a common weed but has ecological value in supporting pollinators."
