    "intro": "Halimium lasianthum var. alyssoides, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variety is closely related to other members of the Caryophyllaceae family and is valued for its resilience and ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
