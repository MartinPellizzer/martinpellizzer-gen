    "intro": "Huanaca hydrocotylea, commonly known as the water pennywort, is a small aquatic plant native to South America. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that help it absorb sunlight for photosynthesis. Its roots are often anchored to submerged surfaces, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Huanaca hydrocotylea plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering nutrients and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
