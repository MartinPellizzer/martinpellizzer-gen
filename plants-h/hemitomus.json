    "intro": "Hemitomus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved helleborine, is a type of orchid that belongs to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its striking, hooded flowers that typically range in color from green to purple. This plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Hemitomus is a perennial herb that often grows close to the ground, with its roots forming dense clusters. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological importance in its native habitats."
