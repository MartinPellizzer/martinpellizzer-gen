    "intro": "Hackelochloa granularis, commonly known as the granular hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, granular texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along waterways. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
