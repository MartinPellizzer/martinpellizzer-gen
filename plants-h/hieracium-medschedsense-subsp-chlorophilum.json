It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and leafy stems. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, exhibiting a low-growing habit with basal leaves. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in dense, flat clusters. The species is notable for its chlorophyll-rich leaves, which contribute to its common name and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments."
