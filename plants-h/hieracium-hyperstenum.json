    "intro": "Hieracium hyperstenum, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, pastures, and roadsides. It has basal leaves that are broadly ovate with toothed margins, and its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. Hieracium hyperstenum is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in grassland ecosystems."
