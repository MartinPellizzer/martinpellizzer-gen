    "intro": "Hedysarum scandens, commonly known as climbing lappet-vetch, is a perennial legume native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its twining stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically light green and have a soft texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in loose clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Hedysarum scandens has a fibrous root system and is often found in moist, wooded areas or along stream banks. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
