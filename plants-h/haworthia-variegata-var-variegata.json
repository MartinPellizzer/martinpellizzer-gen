    "intro": "Haworthia variegata var. variegata, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves arranged in a rosette, often marked with distinct white or yellow markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant is characterized by its ability to store water in its leaves, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for arid environments. It produces small, star-shaped white flowers on slender stems during the cooler months. Its unique appearance and ease of care make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
