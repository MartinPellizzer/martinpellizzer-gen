It features striking, dark red to purple flowers that are clustered in umbels, creating a dramatic visual display. The plant produces a single, fleshy bulb that stores water and nutrients, aiding its survival in arid conditions. Its foliage consists of strap-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
