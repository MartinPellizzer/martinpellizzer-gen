    "intro": "Hyoscyamus desertorum, commonly known as desert henbane, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is a herbaceous annual that produces striking violet or blue flowers with a distinctive hooded shape. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and it thrives in dry, sandy soils. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and contains tropane alkaloids, which make it toxic to livestock and humans. Due to its medicinal and toxic properties, it has been historically used in traditional medicine but requires careful handling."
