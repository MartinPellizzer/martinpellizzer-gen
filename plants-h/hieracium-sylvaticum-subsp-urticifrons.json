    "intro": "Hieracium sylvaticum subsp. urticifrons, commonly known as the stinging nettle hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves that can cause skin irritation. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its subspecific name, *urticifrons*, refers to the stinging hairs on its leaves, which resemble those of the stinging nettle."
