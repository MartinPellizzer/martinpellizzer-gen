    "intro": "Hesperothamnus purpusii, commonly known as the Purpus' spiny shrub, is a perennial plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Hesperothamnus purpusii plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
