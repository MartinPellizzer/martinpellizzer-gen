    "intro": "Habenaria achroantha, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and fascinating orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and its unique, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks a visible leaf structure, relying instead on its stem for photosynthesis. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the understory of forests. Due to its elusive nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate and is highly valued in botanical research."
