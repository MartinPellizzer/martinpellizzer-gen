It exhibits a compact growth habit with dense, hairy foliage that provides protection against environmental stressors. The plant's leaves are typically small and narrow, with a textured surface that aids in water retention. It thrives in specific microhabitats, often found in moist, shaded areas with rich, organic soil. Due to its limited distribution and distinctive traits, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
