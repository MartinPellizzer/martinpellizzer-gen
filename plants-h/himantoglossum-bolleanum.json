    "intro": "Himantoglossum bolleanum, commonly known as the Bolleanum orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its unique, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, with a distinctive hood-like structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland or rocky habitats. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
