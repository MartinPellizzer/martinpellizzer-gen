    "intro": "Hypericum quadrangulum var. tetrapterum, commonly known as the four-winged St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive four-winged leaves, which are opposite and lanceolate in shape. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in summer, which are clustered in small, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. The species is noted for its medicinal properties, though it contains compounds that can be toxic if ingested in large quantities."
