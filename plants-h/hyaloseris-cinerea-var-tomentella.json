    "intro": "Hyaloseris cinerea var. tomentella, commonly known as the silver-haired hyaloseris, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
