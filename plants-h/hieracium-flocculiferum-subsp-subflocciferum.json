    "intro": "Hieracium flocculiferum subsp. subflocciferum, commonly known as the fluffy hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are usually basal, with a rough, hairy texture, and it produces numerous small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and more compact growth habit compared to other members of the species."
