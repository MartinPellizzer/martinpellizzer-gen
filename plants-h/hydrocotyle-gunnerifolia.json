    "intro": "Hydrocotyle gunnerifolia, commonly known as the Caribbean water shield, is a floating aquatic plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It has small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in diameter, with a waxy surface that helps it float on water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the early morning. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, and it plays a role in maintaining water clarity by filtering out sediments. Hydrocotyle gunnerifolia is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats."
