It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a rough, woolly texture, and the stems are often reddish-brown and slightly hairy. The plant is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
