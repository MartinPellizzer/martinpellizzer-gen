    "intro": "Hieracium silvestre, commonly known as woodland hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are bright yellow with a central disk. It is often found in clusters and can spread rapidly through rhizomes, making it both a common weed and a valuable nectar source for pollinators."
