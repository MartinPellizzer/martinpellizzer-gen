    "intro": "Hieracium expansiforme, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has a taproot system and can spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it somewhat invasive in certain regions. Its flowers are typically visited by various pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
