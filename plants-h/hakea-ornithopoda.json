    "intro": "Hakea ornithopoda, commonly known as the blackboy, is a shrub native to the south-west of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and its distinctive, urn-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant produces small, spherical, woody fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native region. Hakea ornithopoda is also known for its ability to form dense thickets, which can be both ecologically significant and potentially invasive."
