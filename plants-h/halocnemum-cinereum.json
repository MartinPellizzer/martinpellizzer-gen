    "intro": "Halocnemum cinereum, commonly known as saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline environments. It thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often found in coastal areas and salt marshes. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss and help it survive in high-salt conditions. Its flowers are typically greenish-white and clustered in dense inflorescences. Halocnemum cinereum plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in saline habitats."
