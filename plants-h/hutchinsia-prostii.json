It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in drought conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the rainy season. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, forming a dense mat. Hutchinsia prostii is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
