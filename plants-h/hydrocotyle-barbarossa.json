    "intro": "Hydrocotyle barbarossa, commonly known as the Mexican shield-leaf, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Central and South America. It features a rosette of heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it an effective ground cover in suitable environments."
