    "intro": "Hypericum lalandii var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features opposite, lanceolate leaves that are broader than those of the typical species, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are composed of numerous small petals. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its medicinal properties, similar to other Hypericum species, have been traditionally used for their anti-inflammatory and antidepressant effects."
