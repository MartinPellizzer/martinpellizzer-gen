    "intro": "Hieracium patzkei, commonly known as the Patzke's hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high alpine regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, thriving in well-drained soils at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its yellow flowers bloom in late summer, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in several European countries."
