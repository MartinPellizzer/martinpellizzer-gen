    "intro": "Hakea decurrens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking spikes of bright red or orange flowers, which appear in spring and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Hakea decurrens is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat."
