    "intro": "Hieracium obscurulum, commonly known as the obscure hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and woodland edges. It features basal leaves that are usually heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowering stems bear clusters of yellow flowers. Hieracium obscurulum is often considered a weed due to its ability to spread rapidly and colonize various environments."
