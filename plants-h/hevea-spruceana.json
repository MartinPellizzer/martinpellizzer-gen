    "intro": "Hevea spruceana, commonly known as the Spruce's rubber tree, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows up to 20 meters in height. The plant is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers. It is notable for its latex-producing properties, similar to other members of the Euphorbiaceae family. However, it is less commercially significant than other hevea species like Hevea brasiliensis."
