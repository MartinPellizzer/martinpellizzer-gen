It features wiry, branching stems and small, yellowish to golden-yellow flowers that resemble small sunflowers. The plant produces bracts that are often mistaken for flowers, which are typically papery and persistent after flowering. It thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant. Its ornamental value is due to its long-lasting, colorful foliage and floral structure."
