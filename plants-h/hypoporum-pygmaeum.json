    "intro": "Hypoporum pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it an adaptation specialist in its ecological niche."
