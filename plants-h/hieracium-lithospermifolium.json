    "intro": "Hieracium lithospermifolium, commonly known as the stone root hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant features hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-gray in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and it produces small, elongated achenes as its seeds. Hieracium lithospermifolium thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous and coastal areas."
