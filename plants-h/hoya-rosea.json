    "intro": "Hoya rosea, commonly known as the rose widow, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its waxy, broad leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its flowers, which are typically pink or white, bloom in late summer and early autumn. Hoya rosea is also noted for its slow growth and ability to produce aerial roots, which help it climb and attach to surfaces."
