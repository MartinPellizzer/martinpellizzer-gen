It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in countries like Argentina and Chile. The plants are evergreen shrubs characterized by their dense, leathery leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and red. They thrive in acidic, well-drained soils and are often found in high-altitude environments. Holtzendorffia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
