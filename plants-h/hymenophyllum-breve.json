    "intro": "Hymenophyllum breve, commonly known as the dwarf fern, is a small, delicate fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, closely packed leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. This plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Hymenophyllum breve thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its intricate leaf structure and unique growth habits make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
