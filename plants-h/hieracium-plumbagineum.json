    "intro": "Hieracium plumbagineum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and the plant produces a milky sap that can be toxic. Hieracium plumbagineum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, where it spreads through its rhizomes and seeds."
