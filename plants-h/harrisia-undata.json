    "intro": "Harrisia undata, commonly known as the night-blooming harrisia, is a species of cactus native to Central America and northern South America. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and produces large, showy flowers that open at night. The plant belongs to the Cactaceae family and is adapted to arid environments with its succulent structure for water storage. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators like moths. The fruit that follows is a red, fleshy berry, which is edible and contains numerous seeds."
