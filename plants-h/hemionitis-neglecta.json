    "intro": "Hemionitis neglecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a small aquatic fern native to parts of Asia and Australia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are often submerged or floating. Its rhizomes form a dense network that helps stabilize the sediment in its environment. Hemionitis neglecta is characterized by its lack of true roots and its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
