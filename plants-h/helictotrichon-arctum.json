    "intro": "Helictotrichon arctum, commonly known as Arctic bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are densely packed. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. Helictotrichon arctum plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife."
