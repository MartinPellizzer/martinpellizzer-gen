    "intro": "Hakea nudiflora, commonly known as the smooth-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, narrow leaves and produces clusters of small, white, flower-like structures that are not true flowers but modified leaves called phyllodes. The plant is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system for water retention. It is often found in heathlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Hakea nudiflora plays an important role in providing habitat and food for local wildlife."
