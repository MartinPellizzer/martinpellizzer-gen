    "intro": "Haemanthus virescens var. albiflos, commonly known as the white-flowered red-hot poker, is a striking evergreen perennial native to South Africa. It features tall, upright stems that bear dense clusters of bright red bracts, which are actually modified leaves, surrounding small, white, tubular flowers. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped blooms in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, adding texture to the landscape. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot."
