    "intro": "Hieracium pseudotubulare, commonly known as the false yarrow or meadow hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and tall, branching stems that bear yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. It has finely divided leaves and is often mistaken for other hawkweed species due to its similar appearance. Hieracium pseudotubulare is an herbaceous perennial that can spread through rhizomes, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
