    "intro": "Heterosmilax raishaensis, commonly known as the Raisha's snake-root, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Convallariaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
