    "intro": "Heracleum oncosepalum, commonly known as the broad-leaved cow parsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. It is native to North America and thrives in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and streambanks. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive white underside, and its stems are usually hairy and ridged. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in flat-topped clusters, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. The plant has a strong, often unpleasant odor, which can deter some herbivores."
