    "intro": "Helichrysum paronychioides, commonly known as the golden everlasting or mountain everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its showy, yellow to orange flowers that resemble small suns. The plant produces small, cylindrical seed heads that are often mistaken for flowers, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Helichrysum paronychioides is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
