    "intro": "Heterotis pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. The plant features broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and white, with a distinctive scent that attracts pollinators like beetles. Heterotis pygmaea plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering nutrients and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
