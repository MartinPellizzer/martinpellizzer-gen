    "intro": "Hackelia ibapensis, commonly known as the pink fairy wand, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of delicate, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, spherical seed pods that split open to release its seeds, a feature typical of the Scrophulariaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant color and unique, wand-like appearance."
