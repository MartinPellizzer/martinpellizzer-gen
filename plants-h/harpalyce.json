    "intro": "Harpalyce, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its palmately compound leaves, which are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The flowers are typically small and clustered in racemes, with pea-like blooms that are usually yellow or greenish-yellow. Harpalyce species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and are often found in disturbed habitats. These plants are known for their ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia, contributing to soil fertility."
