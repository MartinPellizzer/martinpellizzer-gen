    "intro": "Haemanthus brachyandrus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved haemanthus, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright red, lantern-shaped flowers during the summer months. The plant is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. It is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and hardy nature. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
