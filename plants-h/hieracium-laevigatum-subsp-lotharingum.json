    "intro": "Hieracium laevigatum subsp. lotharingum, commonly known as the Lotharingian hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and yellow flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and meadows, and is often found in temperate climates. It produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread. The species is considered a characteristic plant of dry grasslands and is of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological role and morphological features."
