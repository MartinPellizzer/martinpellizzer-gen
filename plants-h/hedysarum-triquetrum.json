    "intro": "Hedysarum triquetrum, commonly known as the three-angled vetch, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically three-lobed and arranged in a distinctive triangular shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in racemate clusters, which bloom in early summer. Hedysarum triquetrum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, woodlands, and along roadsides. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
