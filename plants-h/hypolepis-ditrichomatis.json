    "intro": "Hypolepis ditrichomatis, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Davalliaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often curled when young. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
