It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its stems are covered with glandular hairs, which give it its scientific name. The flowers are usually yellow, with ray florets that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
