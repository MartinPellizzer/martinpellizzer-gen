    "intro": "Hymenasplenium furfuraceum, commonly known as the hairy spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic liverwort found in moist, shaded environments. It has a distinctive appearance with its hairy, lobed leaves that are often clustered in dense tufts. The plant's thalloid structure is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy texture. It typically grows on tree bark or rocks in temperate regions. Hymenasplenium furfuraceum plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing microhabitats for other organisms."
