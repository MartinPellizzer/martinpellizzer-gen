    "intro": "Hypocalyptus canescens, commonly known as the rough-hairless lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its pale yellow to orange thallus, which is typically covered in a layer of fine, white or greyish powdery wax. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is often found growing on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate and subtropical regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for air quality and ecological health."
