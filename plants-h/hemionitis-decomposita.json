    "intro": "Hemionitis decomposita, commonly known as the rock fern, is a rare and unique plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that are divided into small, needle-like segments. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to extreme drought conditions. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, with spores produced in clusters on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hemionitis decomposita is considered a sensitive indicator species of its ecosystem."
