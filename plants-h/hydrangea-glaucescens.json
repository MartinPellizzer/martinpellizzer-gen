    "intro": "Hydrangea glaucescens, commonly known as the blue mist hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, rounded clusters of small, sterile blue or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant's leaves are typically dark green and glossy, with a slightly serrated margin. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The color of its flowers can be influenced by soil pH, with more acidic soils producing deeper blue hues."
