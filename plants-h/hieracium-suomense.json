    "intro": "Hieracium suomense, commonly known as the Finnish hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to northern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in late summer, and it produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Hieracium suomense is notable for its ornamental value and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
