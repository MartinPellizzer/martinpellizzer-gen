    "intro": "Hieracium densisetum, commonly known as the dense-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dense, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist meadows and woodland edges. The plant has a creeping rootstock and produces numerous flowering stems. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white to greyish hairs, which help reduce water loss in its habitat."
