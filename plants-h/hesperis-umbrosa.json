    "intro": "Hesperis umbrosa, commonly known as the shade-loving candytuft, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Its foliage consists of basal leaves that are pinnately divided, and it produces showy white or pale purple flowers in early summer. Hesperis umbrosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in less sunny conditions."
