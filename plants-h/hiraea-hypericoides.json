    "intro": "Hiraea hypericoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf hiraea, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple hue on the underside. Its small, yellowish flowers appear in clusters during the summer months. Hiraea hypericoides is often found in association with other woodland plants and is considered a characteristic component of rich, mesic forest understories."
