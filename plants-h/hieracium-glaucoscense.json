    "intro": "Hieracium glaucoscense, commonly known as the blue-leaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered with a bluish waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators."
