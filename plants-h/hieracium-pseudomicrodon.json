    "intro": "Hieracium pseudomicrodon, commonly known as the small false hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically has hairy stems and leaves that are alternate and lance-shaped. It prefers moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in open woodlands. Due to its small size and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
