    "intro": "Hedysarum venosum, commonly known as the veiny pea or wild vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive veining pattern and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, and it thrives in a variety of soil types, including sandy and loamy soils. Hedysarum venosum is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed areas, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobial bacteria."
