It is a large evergreen tree that can reach heights of up to 50 meters, characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic, with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. This species plays an important ecological role in tropical rainforests and is also significant for its economic value in timber production."
