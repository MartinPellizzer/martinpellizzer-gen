    "intro": "Hartmannia domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican violet, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its showy, violet-colored flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, often found on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are ovate and glossy, with a velvety texture, and it produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
