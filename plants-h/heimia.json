    "intro": "Heimia, commonly known as the \"Mexican snowball,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It consists of several species, with Heimia salicifolia being the most well-known. These plants are native to Mexico and parts of Central America, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Heimia species are characterized by their showy, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, resembling small snowballs. They are typically shrubs or small trees, and some species are cultivated for ornamental purposes due to their striking floral display."
