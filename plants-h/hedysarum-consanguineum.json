    "intro": "Hedysarum consanguineum, commonly known as the red vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of pink to reddish-purple flowers. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and woodland edges. Hedysarum consanguineum plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria."
