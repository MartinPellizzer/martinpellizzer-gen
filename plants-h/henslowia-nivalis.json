    "intro": "Henslowia nivalis, commonly known as the snow henslowia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a low-growing habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in rocky crevices or on mountain slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Henslowia nivalis is considered a vulnerable species."
