    "intro": "Helleborus \u00d7 nigercors subsp. ericsmithii, commonly known as Eric Smith's hellebore, is a hybrid evergreen perennial with dark green, leathery leaves that are deeply lobed and glossy. It produces upright, clustered inflorescences of dark purple to black flowers, which are striking and appear in late winter to early spring. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, where it thrives in moist, shaded woodland habitats. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to bloom during the winter months. The species is also noted for its toxicity, containing various cardiac glycosides that can be harmful if ingested."
