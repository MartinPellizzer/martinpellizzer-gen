    "intro": "Hohenbergia glomerata, commonly known as the clustered hohenbergia, is a species of flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, powdery bloom. The plant produces inflorescences that consist of small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to red. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its compact size and ornamental appeal. Hohenbergia glomerata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
