It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often striped or spotted with contrasting colors. The plant produces small, greenish or brownish flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered along the stem. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in wetland ecosystems."
