    "intro": "Helicia schlechteri, commonly known as the Malabar ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Theaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, aromatic bark. The plant produces small, white flowers that are borne in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in moist, shaded habitats. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
