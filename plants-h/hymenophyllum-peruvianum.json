    "intro": "Hymenophyllum peruvianum, commonly known as the Peruvian toothbrush fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the Hymenophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, hair-like fronds that give it a unique, lace-like appearance. This epiphytic plant typically grows on tree trunks and rocks in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are thin and leathery, with a distinctive, serrated margin. Hymenophyllum peruvianum thrives in high humidity and requires consistent moisture to maintain its vibrant green color and delicate structure."
