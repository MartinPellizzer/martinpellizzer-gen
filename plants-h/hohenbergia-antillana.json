    "intro": "Hohenbergia antillana, commonly known as the Antillean hohenbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Caribbean. It features vibrant, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, often with a reddish or purplish hue. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing showy, long-lasting flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hohenbergia antillana is prized for its ornamental value and ease of care in tropical and subtropical climates."
