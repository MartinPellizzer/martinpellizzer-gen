    "intro": "Hieracium reducatum, commonly known as the lesser hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with hairy stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. Hieracium reducatum is considered a weed in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to colonize various habitats."
