It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Hedysarum calvertii plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife."
