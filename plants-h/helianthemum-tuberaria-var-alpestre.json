It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, rocky habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and dry slopes. Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions make it a hardy and resilient species."
