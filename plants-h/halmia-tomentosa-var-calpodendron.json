    "intro": "Halmia tomentosa var. calpodendron, commonly known as the woolly halmia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy, pale yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, white to grayish pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences and bloom during the warmer months."
