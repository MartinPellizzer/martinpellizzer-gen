    "intro": "Haworthia zantneriana var. minor, commonly known as the Zantner's Haworthia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, bluish-green leaves with white to pale yellow markings, which are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers on slender stems during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor and rock garden settings."
