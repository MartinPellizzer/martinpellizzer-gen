    "intro": "Helonias tenax, commonly known as the swamp pink, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and marshes, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form colonies in suitable environments. Helonias tenax plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
