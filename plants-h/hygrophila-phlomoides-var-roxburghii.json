    "intro": "Hygrophila phlomoides var. roxburghii, commonly known as the Indian waterweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, opposite leaves that are often dark green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in spikes. It thrives in moist or aquatic environments, making it a common species in wetlands and along water bodies. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful aquatic plant and a potential weed in certain ecosystems."
