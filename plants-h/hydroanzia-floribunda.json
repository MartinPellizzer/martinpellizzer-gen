    "intro": "Hydroanzia floribunda, commonly known as the water starflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in South America. It features showy, star-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, blooming in late summer. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves and produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Hydroanzia floribunda plays an important role in supporting local biodiversity by providing nectar for pollinators."
