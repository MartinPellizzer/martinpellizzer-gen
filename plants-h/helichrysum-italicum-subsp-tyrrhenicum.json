    "intro": "Helichrysum italicum subsp. tyrrhenicum, commonly known as the Tyrrhenian immortelle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly Italy. It is characterized by its aromatic, yellow-orange flowers and silver-gray foliage, which are covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its essential oil, derived from the leaves and flowers, is valued for its medicinal and aromatic properties. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and more compact growth compared to the broader H. italicum species."
