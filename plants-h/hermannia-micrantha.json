    "intro": "Hermannia micrantha, commonly known as the African bellflower, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of fleshy, narrow leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white. The plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Hermannia micrantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
