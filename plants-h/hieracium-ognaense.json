    "intro": "Hieracium ognaense, commonly known as the Ognan hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the daisy family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. It has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces numerous small, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
