    "intro": "Hippocratea serrulata, commonly known as the serrated hippocratea, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with serrated leaves that give it its common name. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often in moist, well-drained soils. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure."
