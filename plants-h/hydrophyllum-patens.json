    "intro": "Hydrophyllum patens, commonly known as the spreading hydrophyllum, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Hydrophyllum patens plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native environment."
