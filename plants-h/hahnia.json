    "intro": "Hahnia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its unique, often fragrant, umbel-shaped inflorescences that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plants typically have finely divided, fern-like leaves and are often found in moist, shaded environments. Hahnia species are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in the eastern United States and parts of Canada. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
