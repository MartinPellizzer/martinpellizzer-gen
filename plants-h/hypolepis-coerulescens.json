    "intro": "Hypolepis coerulescens, commonly known as the blue fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that display a striking blue-green hue, especially when dry. The plant has a short, rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Hypolepis coerulescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
