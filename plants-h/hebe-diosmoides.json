    "intro": "Hebe diosmoides, commonly known as the mountain hebe, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a shrub that typically grows in cool, moist environments, often found in forested areas and on rocky slopes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is characterized by narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Hebe diosmoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual interest."
