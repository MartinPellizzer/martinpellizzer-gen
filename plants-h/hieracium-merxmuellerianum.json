    "intro": "Hieracium merxmuellerianum, commonly known as Merxm\u00fcller's hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and is typically found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. The plant produces yellow ray flowers surrounded by a dense cluster of tubular florets, which are adapted for pollination by insects. Its leaves are generally basal, alternate, and have a rough, hairy texture. Hieracium merxmuellerianum is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, where it can sometimes become invasive."
