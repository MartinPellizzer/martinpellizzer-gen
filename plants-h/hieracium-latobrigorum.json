    "intro": "Hieracium latobrigorum, commonly known as the Littoral Hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of Europe. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shores, where it tolerates salt spray and fluctuating moisture levels. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. It produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. Hieracium latobrigorum plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
