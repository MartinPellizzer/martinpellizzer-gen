    "intro": "Hybanthus communis f. circaeoides, commonly known as the small-leaved hybanthus, is a compact shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically glandular and hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom throughout the year in some regions. Its flowering pattern and compact growth make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The variety f. circaeoides is distinguished by its smaller leaves compared to the typical form of H. communis."
