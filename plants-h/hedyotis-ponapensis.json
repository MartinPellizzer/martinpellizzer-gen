    "intro": "Hedyotis ponapensis, commonly known as the Caroline Islands bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to the Caroline Islands in the Pacific Ocean. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Hedyotis ponapensis is adapted to tropical climates and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
