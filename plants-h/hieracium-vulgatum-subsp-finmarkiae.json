    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. finmarkiae, commonly known as the Finnish hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern Europe. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces yellow flowers in a composite head. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a serrated edge, while the stems are upright and slightly hairy. This subspecies is distinguished by its smaller flower heads and shorter stature compared to other members of the Hieracium genus."
