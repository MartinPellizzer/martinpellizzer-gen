    "intro": "Hieracium corrosifolium, commonly known as the roughleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and typically wind-pollinated flowers. The plant has rough, hairy leaves that are often lobed, and its flowers are yellow, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats. Due to its aggressive growth, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
