    "intro": "Heliconia longiflora subsp. longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered heliconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, and is characterized by its large, brightly colored bracts that resemble petals. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with numerous small, clustered flowers, which are often used in floral arrangements. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and covered with a waxy cuticle, helping it retain moisture in its humid habitat. Heliconia longiflora subsp. longiflora is also an important plant for certain pollinators, particularly hummingbirds and bats."
