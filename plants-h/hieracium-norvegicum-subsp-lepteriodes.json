    "intro": "Hieracium norvegicum subsp. lepteriodes, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. It has a taproot system and produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
