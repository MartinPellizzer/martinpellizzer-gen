    "intro": "Helianthemum diversifolium var. multiplex, commonly known as the multifoliate rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and dense clusters of small, yellow flowers. The leaves are typically lobed or dissected, varying in shape and size, which contributes to its common name. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in sunny, coastal or mountainous regions. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
