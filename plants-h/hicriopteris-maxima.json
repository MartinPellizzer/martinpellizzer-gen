    "intro": "Hicriopteris maxima, commonly known as the giant holly fern, is a large, robust fern native to the forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that can grow up to two meters in length. The plant has a distinctive, upright growth habit with a thick, rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Hicriopteris maxima is often used in ornamental gardening due to its dramatic appearance and adaptability to humid conditions."
