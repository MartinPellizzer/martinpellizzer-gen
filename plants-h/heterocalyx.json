    "intro": "Heterocalyx, commonly known as the \"different calyx\" plant, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its unique calyx structure, which varies in shape and size across different species. The leaves are typically opposite and ovate, with serrated margins, while the flowers are usually small and clustered in inflorescences. The fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed, and the plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Heterocalyx species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
