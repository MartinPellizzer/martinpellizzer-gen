    "intro": "Heterotrichum polyandrum, commonly known as the many-stalked feather moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant has elongated, wiry stems that are often branched and covered with small, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on stalks and release spores when mature. Heterotrichum polyandrum is often found in boreal and temperate regions, contributing to soil stabilization and moisture retention in forest ecosystems."
