    "intro": "Helenium obtusifolium, commonly known as bluntleaf sneezeweed, is a flowering plant native to the central and southern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and showy, orange to red blooms. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and have a blunt or rounded tip, giving it its common name. Helenium obtusifolium is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
