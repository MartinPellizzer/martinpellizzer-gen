    "intro": "Hypoestes aristata var. aristata, commonly known as the African violet or velvet plant, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant features velvety, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a slight sheen. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
