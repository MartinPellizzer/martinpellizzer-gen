    "intro": "Heracleum pubescens var. glabratum, commonly known as the smooth cow parsnip, is a flowering plant in the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a hairy underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Due to its resemblance to toxic plants, it is sometimes mistaken for poison hemlock, requiring careful identification."
