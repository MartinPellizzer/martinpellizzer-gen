It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. The flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
