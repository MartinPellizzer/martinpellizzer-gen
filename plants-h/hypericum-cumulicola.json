    "intro": "Hypericum cumulicola, commonly known as the mountain St. John's wort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Hypericum cumulicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
