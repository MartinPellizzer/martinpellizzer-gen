It features broad, slightly wavy, dark green leaves with a prominent blue-gray variegation that adds a dramatic visual effect. The plant produces upright, terminal spikes of fragrant, white to pale blue flowers in late summer. Its foliage is particularly showy, making it a popular choice for shaded garden landscapes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, requiring minimal maintenance once established."
