    "intro": "Haloragis nodulosa, commonly known as the nodular willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland heathlands. Haloragis nodulosa is adapted to arid conditions and is drought-tolerant once established."
