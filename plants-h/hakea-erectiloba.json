    "intro": "Hakea erectiloba, commonly known as the erect-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking, bottlebrush-like inflorescences that range in color from white to pink, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Hakea erectiloba is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
