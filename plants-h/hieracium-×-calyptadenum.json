    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 calyptadenum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically has basal and stem leaves that are broadly lance-shaped with serrated edges. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
