    "intro": "Hymenophyllum gratum, commonly known as the silver moss, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a small, kidney-shaped shield. Hymenophyllum gratum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal."
