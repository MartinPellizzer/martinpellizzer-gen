It features rosettes of fleshy, pointed leaves that are typically green with white or yellowish markings. The plant is known for its compact size and ability to store water in its leaves, making it drought-tolerant. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale yellow during the growing season. This species is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance."
