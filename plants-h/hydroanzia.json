    "intro": "Hydroanzia, commonly known as the water lily of the genus Hydroanzia, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa and South America. They are typically aquatic or semi-aquatic, with broad, floating leaves and showy flowers that bloom in the early morning. The flowers are usually pink or white, and they open to expose their reproductive structures to pollinators. Hydroanzia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological roles in wetland habitats."
