It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped fronds. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fiddlehead-like young fronds that unfurl as they mature. Its leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, ovate pinnae that are closely spaced. Hypolepis hauman-merckii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
