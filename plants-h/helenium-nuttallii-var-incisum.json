    "intro": "Helenium nuttallii var. incisum, commonly known as the Cutleaf Hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the central and eastern United States. It features finely cut, feather-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance, and its bright orange to red flowers bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It is part of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like inflorescences. Its botanical structure supports its role in wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
