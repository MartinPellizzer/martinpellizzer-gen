    "intro": "Hypolepis pallida, commonly known as the pale fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, whitish hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Hypolepis pallida is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
