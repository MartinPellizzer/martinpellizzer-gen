    "intro": "Hieracium prasinicolor, commonly known as the green-centred hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its bright yellow ray florets and a central disc that appears green, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands across Europe and parts of Asia. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and often branched. Hieracium prasinicolor produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into seeds dispersed by the wind."
