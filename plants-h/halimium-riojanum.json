    "intro": "Halimium riojanum, commonly known as the Rioja rock rose, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly Spain. It is a low-growing shrub with small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Halimium riojanum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
