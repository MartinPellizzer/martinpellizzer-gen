    "intro": "Habenaria arechavaletae, commonly known as the Arechavaleta's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are fibrous, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
