It features compact, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or yellow markings. The plant produces vibrant flowers in shades of red, pink, and orange during the winter months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight. Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
