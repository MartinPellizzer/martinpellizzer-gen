    "intro": "Herpestis chamaedryoides, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. The plant features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming a dense mat. Its flowers are small, bell-shaped, and usually violet or blue in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. The leaves are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
