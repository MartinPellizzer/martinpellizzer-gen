    "intro": "Heliotropium crispulum, commonly known as the creeping heliotrope, is a low-growing annual herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features prostrate or ascending stems covered in dense, glandular hairs that give it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, violet to pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and often have a waxy texture. Heliotropium crispulum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and gardens."
