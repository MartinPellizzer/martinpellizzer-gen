It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with hairy surfaces, and its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium angustidens is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
