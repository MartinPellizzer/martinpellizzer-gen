    "intro": "Hieracium subfurculatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It produces small, yellow flowers that are arranged in a flat-topped cluster, and its leaves are narrow and often hairy. Hieracium subfurculatum is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through its rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain habitats."
