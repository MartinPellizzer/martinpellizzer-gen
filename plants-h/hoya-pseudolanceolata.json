    "intro": "Hoya pseudolanceolata, commonly known as the waxy hoya, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink, often blooming during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hoya pseudolanceolata is popular among houseplant enthusiasts due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal."
