    "intro": "Hypericum macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-flowered St. John's wort, is a shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and woody stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy yellow-orange flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. These flowers are followed by red-orange\u84b4\u679c that split open to release seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils."
