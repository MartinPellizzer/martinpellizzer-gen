    "intro": "Hieracium villosum subsp. acrovillosum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces yellowish to orange composite flowers, which are typically arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a rough, hairy texture, and it is often mistaken for other hawkweed species due to its similar appearance."
