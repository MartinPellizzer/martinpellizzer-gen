    "intro": "Hemionitis formosa, commonly known as the golden thread fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of China and Southeast Asia. It has a compact, rosette-like growth habit with slender, arching fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
