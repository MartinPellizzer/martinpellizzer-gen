    "intro": "Hieracium collatatum, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in clusters. Hieracium collatatum is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
