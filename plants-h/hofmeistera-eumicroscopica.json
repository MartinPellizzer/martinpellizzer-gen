    "intro": "Hofmeistera eumicroscopica, commonly known as the microscopic orchid, is a rare and diminutive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its extremely small size, with flowers measuring less than a millimeter in diameter, making it one of the smallest flowering plants in the world. The plant's botanical features include a slender, terrestrial rhizome and small, leathery leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with intricate structures that facilitate pollination by minute insects. Due to its extreme fragility and limited distribution, it is classified as a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
