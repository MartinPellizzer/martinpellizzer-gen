    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. perpurpurans, commonly known as the purple devil's bit scabious, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. Its striking purple to reddish-pink flowers bloom from late summer to early autumn, attracting a variety of pollinators. The subspecies is distinguished by its more intensely colored flowers and slightly different leaf morphology compared to other members of the species."
