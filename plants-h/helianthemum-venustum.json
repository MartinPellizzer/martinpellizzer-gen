It is a low-growing shrub with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, dry climates."
