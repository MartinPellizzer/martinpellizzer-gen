    "intro": "Habenaria montis-elgon, commonly known as the Elgon marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the montane regions of East Africa, particularly around Mount Elgon. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and grasslands. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the soil. The orchid plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystem by contributing to biodiversity and providing nectar for pollinators."
