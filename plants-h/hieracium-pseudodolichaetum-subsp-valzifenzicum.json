    "intro": "Hieracium pseudodolichaetum subsp. valzifenzicum, commonly known as the Valzeignan hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Alps. It typically grows in moist, calcareous grasslands and meadows at high altitudes. The plant has basal and erect stems with rough, hairy surfaces, and its leaves are lanceolate with serrated edges. Its flowers are yellow, with a distinctive central disc and ray florets, and it blooms from June to August. This subspecies is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity."
