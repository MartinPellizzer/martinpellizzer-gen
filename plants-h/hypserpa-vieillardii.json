It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
