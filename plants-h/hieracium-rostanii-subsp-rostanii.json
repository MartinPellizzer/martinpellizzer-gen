    "intro": "Hieracium rostanii subsp. rostanii, commonly known as the Rostan's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, serrated leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. It is part of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal potential. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
