    "intro": "Hoya arnottiana, commonly known as the \"Wax Plant\" or \"Porcelain Flower,\" is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features thick, fleshy, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, often with a subtle fragrance. Hoya arnottiana thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
