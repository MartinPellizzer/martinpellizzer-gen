    "intro": "Habenaria angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is an orchid native to parts of Asia and Australia. It is a terrestrial herb with a short, underground stem and a single, narrow leaf. The plant produces a spike of small, greenish-white flowers that are often mistaken for leaves due to their shape. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The species is known for its delicate appearance and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
