    "intro": "Helosciadium inundatum var. terrestre, commonly known as the terrestrial helosciadium, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, adapting well to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic insects."
