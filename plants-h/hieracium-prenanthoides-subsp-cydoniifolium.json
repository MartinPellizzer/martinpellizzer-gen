    "intro": "Hieracium prenanthoides subsp. cydoniifolium, commonly known as the lemon-leaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often yellowish-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense clusters, typically from June to August. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. Its foliage and floral structure are adapted to maximize light absorption in its natural environment."
