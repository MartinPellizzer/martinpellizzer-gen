    "intro": "Haageocereus fulvus var. yautanensis, commonly known as the Yautanensis Cereus, is a columnar cactus native to Mexico. It features a tall, cylindrical stem with a greenish-gray color and spiny areoles. The plant produces white flowers during the summer months, which are typically nocturnal in bloom. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for arid garden landscapes."
