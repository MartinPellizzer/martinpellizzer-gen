    "intro": "Hancockia, commonly known as the yellow gentian, is a genus of flowering plants native to the eastern and central United States. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to blue. Hancockia species typically grow in moist, woodland habitats and are often found in shaded areas with rich, loamy soil. The plants are perennial, with lance-shaped leaves and produce small, seed-like fruits that are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss, many Hancockia species are now considered threatened or endangered."
