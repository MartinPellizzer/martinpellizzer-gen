    "intro": "Hieracium tumidoides, commonly known as the inflated hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and leafy stems. The plant features dark green, broadly ovate leaves with serrated edges, and produces yellow flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, grassy habitats and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
