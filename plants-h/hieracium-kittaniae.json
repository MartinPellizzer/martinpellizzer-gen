It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and open habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. It features a basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
