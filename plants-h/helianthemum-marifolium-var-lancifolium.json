It features small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It typically grows in rocky soils and open, sunny habitats. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it a suitable ornamental plant for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
