    "intro": "Hordeum vulgare var. spontaneum, commonly known as wild barley, is a wild grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, two-rowed spikelets that contain three to five bracts. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, fields, and riverbanks. This species is important in ecological studies due to its role in soil stabilization and as a potential wild relative of cultivated barley."
