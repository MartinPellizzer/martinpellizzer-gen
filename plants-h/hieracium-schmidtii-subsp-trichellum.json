    "intro": "Hieracium schmidtii subsp. trichellum, commonly known as the Schmidt's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. The flowering stems rise above the leaves, bearing yellow composite flowers that are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly serrated margin. This subspecies is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and is characterized by its compact growth habit and resilience to cold temperatures."
