    "intro": "Hierochloe alpina, commonly known as alpine hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, mat-forming growth habit, which helps it thrive in harsh alpine environments. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, rocky slopes, and tundra habitats. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces wind-pollinated flowers, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems. Hierochloe alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
