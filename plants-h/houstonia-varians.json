    "intro": "Houstonia varians, commonly known as the variable blue-eyed grass, is a low-growing herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are pollinated by various insects, including bees and flies. Houstonia varians thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local pollinator populations."
