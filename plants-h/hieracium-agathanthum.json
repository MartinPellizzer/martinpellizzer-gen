    "intro": "Hieracium agathanthum, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate in shape, with rough, hairy surfaces. Its showy yellow flowers are typically arranged in a single terminal head, surrounded by pale green bracts. Hieracium agathanthum is known for its aggressive growth and is considered a weed in some regions due to its ability to spread rapidly."
