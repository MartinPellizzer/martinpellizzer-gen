    "intro": "Hieracium kintyricum, commonly known as the Kintyre hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the British Isles. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along coastal regions, preferring well-drained soils. Its yellow-orange flowers are surrounded by leaf-like bracts, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium kintyricum is often found in habitats such as coastal dunes and moorlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
