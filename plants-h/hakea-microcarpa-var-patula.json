    "intro": "Hakea microcarpa var. patula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to south-western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces striking cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from yellow to red, depending on the species. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. This variety is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
