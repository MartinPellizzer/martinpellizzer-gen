    "intro": "Hylonome reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined hylonome, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and mountainous regions. Its leaves are often covered in a thin, waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. Hylonome reticulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
