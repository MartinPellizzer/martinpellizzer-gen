    "intro": "Hieracium pseudalpinum subsp. pseudoglanduliferum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and open, sunny environments. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving it a slightly sticky texture. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a single head, with ray florets that are often shorter than the central disk florets. This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth form and is adapted to withstand cold and harsh climatic conditions."
