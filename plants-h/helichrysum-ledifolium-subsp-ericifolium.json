    "intro": "Helichrysum ledifolium subsp. ericifolium, commonly known as the Ericaceous helichrysum, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed along its stems. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in late summer, which are borne in dense, fluffy clusters. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is cultivated in gardens as a hardy, low-maintenance plant."
