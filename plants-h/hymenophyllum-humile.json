    "intro": "Hymenophyllum humile, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has thin, wiry stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves arranged in a spiral pattern. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered in dense, spore-producing clusters on the underside of the leaves. Hymenophyllum humile plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil moisture and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
