    "intro": "Hysterobaeckea cornuta, commonly known as the slender sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a small annual herb with narrow, linear leaves and produces small, pale blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal and inland arid environments. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
