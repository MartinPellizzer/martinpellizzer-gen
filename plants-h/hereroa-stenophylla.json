It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
