It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring temperate climates. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium naegelianiforme is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
