    "intro": "Helenium cordatum, commonly known as the heartleaf helenium, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its bright orange to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often heart-shaped at the base, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Helenium cordatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
