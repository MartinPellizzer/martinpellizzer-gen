    "intro": "Hieracium polybalium, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium polybalium is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
