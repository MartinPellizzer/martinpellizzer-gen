    "intro": "Hieracium apiculare, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a rough texture, while its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Hieracium apiculare is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit and ability to spread rapidly."
