    "intro": "Hieracium adenopalantianum, commonly known as the adenopalantian hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
