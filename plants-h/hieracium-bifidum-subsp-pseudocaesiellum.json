It is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and shorter flower stems compared to other hawkweed species. It is native to central and eastern Europe and thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is occasionally grown in gardens."
