    "intro": "Humboltia lanceolata, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of the United States. It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family, characterized by its climbing habit and trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along coastal areas, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are lanceolate, hence the species name, and it produces vibrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in the morning. Humboltia lanceolata plays a role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
