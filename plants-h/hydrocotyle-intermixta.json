    "intro": "Hydrocotyle intermixta, commonly known as the marsh mallow or water mallow, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in the Americas. It features a rosette of heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and pond edges. Hydrocotyle intermixta is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
