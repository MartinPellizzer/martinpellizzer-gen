    "intro": "Hamamelis corylifolia, commonly known as the Chinese witch hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the autumn, before the leaves fall. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture. Hamamelis corylifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional Chinese medicine."
