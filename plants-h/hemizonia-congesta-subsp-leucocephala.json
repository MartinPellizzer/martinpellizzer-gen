    "intro": "Hemizonia congesta subsp. leucocephala, commonly known as the white-headed broom, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, wiry stems and small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that give it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
