    "intro": "Hieracium chondrillifolium subsp. megalocladum, commonly known as the giant-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its robust growth and large, serrated leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its subspecies status reflects subtle differences in leaf morphology and habitat preference compared to other Hieracium species."
