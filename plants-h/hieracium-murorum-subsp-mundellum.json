    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. mundellum, commonly known as the common mouse-ear hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain habitats."
