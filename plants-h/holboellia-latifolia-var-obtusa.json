    "intro": "Holboellia latifolia var. obtusa, commonly known as the broadleaf holboellia, is a perennial herb native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which bloom during the wet season. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
