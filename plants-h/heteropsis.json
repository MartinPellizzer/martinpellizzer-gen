    "intro": "Heteropsis, commonly known as the \"false hibiscus,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the Malvaceae family. It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plants are shrubs or small trees with alternate, simple, and often hairy leaves. They produce showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink, red, or white, and they are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Heteropsis species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their vibrant blooms."
