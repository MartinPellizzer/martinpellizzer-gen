    "intro": "Hieracium apatelioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble clusters of tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
