    "intro": "Herpysma bracteata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Herpysma bracteata is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered an invasive species in some areas."
