    "intro": "Hargasseria aronifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf dittany, is a rare and endemic plant native to the island of Sicily. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs that give it a distinctive appearance and help reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
