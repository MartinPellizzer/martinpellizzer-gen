    "intro": "Hymenophyllum crispatum, commonly known as the curly hound's-tongue, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hair. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves. Hymenophyllum crispatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
