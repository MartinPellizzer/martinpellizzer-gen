    "intro": "Hypochaeris salina, commonly known as saltwort or sea hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces bright yellow composite flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hypochaeris salina is often found growing on dunes and salt marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Its ability to thrive in high-salt conditions makes it an important species for coastal ecosystems."
