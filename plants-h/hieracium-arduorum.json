    "intro": "Hieracium arduorum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high altitudes. The plant features bright yellow composite flowers that are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Hieracium arduorum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
