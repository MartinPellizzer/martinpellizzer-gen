    "intro": "Hedera helix f. cullisii, commonly known as the Cullisii ivy, is a compact, evergreen climbing plant native to the British Isles. It features dark green, glossy leaves that are typically heart-shaped with a smooth or slightly lobed margin. This variety is prized for its dense growth habit and ability to thrive in shaded environments, making it ideal for ground cover or wall coverings. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, followed by dark berries that are attractive to birds. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for both garden and indoor cultivation."
