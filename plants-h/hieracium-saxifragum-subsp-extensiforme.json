    "intro": "Hieracium saxifragum subsp. extensiforme, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flower heads that are typically arranged in a flat-topped cluster, with ray florets that are often shorter than the disk florets. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and rocky areas. Its fibrous root system allows it to colonize a variety of soil types and withstand environmental stress."
