    "intro": "Helianthemum glaucum f. suffruticosum, commonly known as the rock rose or coastal thrift, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, waxy, gray-green leaves that are typically covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry, sunny slopes. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscaping."
