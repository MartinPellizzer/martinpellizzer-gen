It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers. This variety is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and resilience to harsh conditions."
