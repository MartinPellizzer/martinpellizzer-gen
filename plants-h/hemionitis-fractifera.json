    "intro": "Hemionitis fractifera, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a small aquatic fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble a lace-like pattern. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant in the substrate while supporting its floating fronds. Hemionitis fractifera is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in aquatic environments."
