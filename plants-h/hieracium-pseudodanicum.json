    "intro": "Hieracium pseudodanicum, commonly known as the false Danish hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering heads that produce yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale yellow to white ray florets. Native to Europe, it thrives in moist meadows, stream banks, and other damp habitats. The plant has rough, hairy leaves and can grow up to 40 cm in height. It is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid spread and competitive growth habit."
