    "intro": "Hieracium atribarbatum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomatous stems that allow it to spread vegetatively. The leaves are usually basal, with a rough, hairy texture, and the flowers are yellow, often appearing in clusters."
