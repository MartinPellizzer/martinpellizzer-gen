It is characterized by its upright growth habit and its clusters of large, showy flowers that range from white to deep pink, depending on soil pH. The plant produces small, oval leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its floral display. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and its ability to bloom reliably in suitable conditions."
