It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its triangular-shaped stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. It typically grows in moist meadows and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into achene fruits, contributing to its propagation in suitable habitats."
