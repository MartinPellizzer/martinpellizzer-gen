    "intro": "Hieracium galaticum, commonly known as the Galatic hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers with ray florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often colonizing roadsides and meadows. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
