    "intro": "Hypericum quadrangulum subsp. obtusiusculum, commonly known as the blunt-leaved St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellow floral clusters that bloom in summer, typical of the Hypericaceae family. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a blunt or rounded tip, giving it its subspecific name. It typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats. The plant contains hypericin and other flavonoids, which have been studied for their potential medicinal properties."
