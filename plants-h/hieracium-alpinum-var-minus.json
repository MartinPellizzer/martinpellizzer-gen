    "intro": "Hieracium alpinum var. minus, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in mountainous regions where other plants struggle to survive."
