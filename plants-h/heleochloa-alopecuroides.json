    "intro": "Heleochloa alopecuroides, commonly known as the coastal grass or sea grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along coastal areas. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually arranged in spikelets and are wind-pollinated."
