It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disc.
