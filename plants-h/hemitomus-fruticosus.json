    "intro": "Hemitomus fruticosus, commonly known as the creeping thornapple, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is characterized by its branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by spherical, spiky fruits. It is often found in rocky or sandy habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions. Due to its thorny stems and toxic sap, it is generally avoided by livestock and humans."
