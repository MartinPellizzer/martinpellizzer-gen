    "intro": "Hyssopus officinalis var. vulgaris, commonly known as common hyssop, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly aromatic scent. The plant produces spikes of blue to purple flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often growing in rocky or dry habitats. Common hyssop is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used historically in herbal remedies."
