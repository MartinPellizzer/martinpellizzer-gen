    "intro": "Hermione bertolonii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and its unique, fragrant flowers that resemble those of orchids. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
