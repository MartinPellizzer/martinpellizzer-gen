    "intro": "Hakea leucocephala, commonly known as the white-headed hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves and striking white, spherical flower heads that appear in spring. The plant is adapted to arid and coastal environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and salt resistance. Its flowers attract nectar-feeding birds and insects, playing a role in local pollination networks. Hakea leucocephala is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
