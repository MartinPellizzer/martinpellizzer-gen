    "intro": "Hieracium bupleuroides subsp. mnoolepium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow disk flowers with ray florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, often becoming invasive in some areas. Due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize various soil types, it can outcompete native vegetation."
