    "intro": "Hieracium triangulare var. subtriangulare, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its distinctive triangular-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, and it produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. The species is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies."
