    "intro": "Hieracium pellitum subsp. quercifolioides, commonly known as the oak-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves that resemble the shape of oak leaves, hence its common name. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
