    "intro": "Hygrophila hispida, commonly known as the velvet-leaf hygrophila, is a perennial aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It features dark green, ovate leaves with a velvety texture and prominent veins. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in spikes, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in shallow water and is often found in slow-moving streams and rice paddies. Hygrophila hispida is valued in aquariums for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
