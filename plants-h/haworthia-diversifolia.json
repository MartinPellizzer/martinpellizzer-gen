It features distinctive, fleshy, triangular leaves with white or yellowish markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink during the spring or summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
