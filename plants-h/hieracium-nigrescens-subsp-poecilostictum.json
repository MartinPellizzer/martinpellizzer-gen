    "intro": "Hieracium nigrescens subsp. poecilostictum, commonly known as the dark-haired hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in several regions."
