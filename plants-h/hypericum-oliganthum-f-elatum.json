The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that attract pollinators. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or wildflower meadows. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
