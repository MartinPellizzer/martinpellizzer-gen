    "intro": "Hypserpa selwynii, commonly known as the Selwyn's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-yellow flowers and unique, elongated sepals that resemble a ghostly appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within forest undergrowth, often on the trunks of trees or in rock crevices. It has a slender, wiry stem and produces small, inconspicuous leaves. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Hypserpa selwynii is considered a vulnerable species, making it a subject of conservation interest."
