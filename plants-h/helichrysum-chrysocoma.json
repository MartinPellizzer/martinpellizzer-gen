    "intro": "Helichrysum chrysocoma, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a South African native plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and bright yellow, sun-like flowers that remain intact for a long time after blooming. The plant produces small, bract-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Helichrysum chrysocoma is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
