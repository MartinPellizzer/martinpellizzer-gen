    "intro": "Heteromorpha arborescens var. trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three distinct lobes, which is a key identifying characteristic. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
