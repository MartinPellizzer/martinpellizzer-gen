    "intro": "Hieracium chlorocephalum, commonly known as the green-headed hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically has basal and stem leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
