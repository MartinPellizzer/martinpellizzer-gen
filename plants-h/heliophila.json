    "intro": "Heliophila, commonly known as sunflower grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges. These plants are typically found in wet or marshy areas, thriving in moist soil conditions. Heliophila species are characterized by their narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that often have a pale or white color. They play an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms. Due to their preference for wet environments, they are often used in ecological restoration projects."
