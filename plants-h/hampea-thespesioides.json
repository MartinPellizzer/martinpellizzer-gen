It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with hairy stems and palmate leaves. Its flowers are clustered in terminal panicles and bloom during the dry season, attracting various pollinators. The seeds are enclosed in a hairy capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
