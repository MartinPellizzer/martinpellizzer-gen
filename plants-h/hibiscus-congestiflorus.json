    "intro": "Hibiscus congestiflorus, commonly known as the clustered hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. Its flowers are borne in clusters, giving the plant its common name, and it blooms throughout the warmer months. Hibiscus congestiflorus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun."
