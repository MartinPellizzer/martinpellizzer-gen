    "intro": "Hieracium rhoeadifolium, commonly known as the prairie hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to North America, particularly found in prairie and open grassland habitats. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with hairy stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces seeds in achenes with pappus structures for wind dispersal. Hieracium rhoeadifolium is often considered a pioneer species in disturbed soils and plays a role in stabilizing soil in ecological succession."
