    "intro": "Hydrocotyle nitidula, commonly known as glossy pennywort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense mats on the surface of ponds or stream edges. The plant features rounded, glossy leaves that are usually less than 1 inch in diameter, with a waxy texture that helps repel water. It produces small, white flowers that bloom from summer to autumn, and its roots can spread rapidly, making it both a useful water purifier and a potential invasive species. The plant is often used in water gardens for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize aquatic environments."
