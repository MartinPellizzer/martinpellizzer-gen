    "intro": "Hedysarum alpinum subsp. boreoeuropaeum, commonly known as the Alpine vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to violet. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with stipules and has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil in rocky or alpine environments. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and scree slopes. Hedysarum alpinum subsp. boreoeuropaeum plays a role in nitrogen fixation and is of interest in ecological restoration projects."
