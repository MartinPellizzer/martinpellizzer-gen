    "intro": "Haplopappus parrasanus, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in sandy, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Haplopappus parrasanus plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
