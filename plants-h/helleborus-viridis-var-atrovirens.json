    "intro": "Helleborus viridis var. atrovirens, commonly known as the dark green hellebore, is a perennial plant native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves that remain evergreen throughout the year. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of green and white, typically blooming in late winter or early spring. It thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-drained, humus-rich soil. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and kept away from pets and children."
