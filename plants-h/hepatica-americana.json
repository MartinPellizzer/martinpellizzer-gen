    "intro": "Hepatica americana, commonly known as the American liverwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that resemble a liver, hence its common name. The plant typically blooms in early spring with showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of white, blue, or purple. Hepatica americana thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in rich, well-drained soils. It is a valuable plant for pollinators and is sometimes used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value."
