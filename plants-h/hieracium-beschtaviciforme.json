    "intro": "Hieracium beschtaviciforme, commonly known as the Baltic hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the cooler regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy areas and has hairy stems with alternate leaves. Its yellow flowers bloom in late summer, and it spreads primarily through rhizomes and seeds. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
