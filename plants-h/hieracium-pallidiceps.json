    "intro": "Hieracium pallidiceps, commonly known as the pale-headed hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowers are yellow, with a pale central disk, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium pallidiceps is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas."
