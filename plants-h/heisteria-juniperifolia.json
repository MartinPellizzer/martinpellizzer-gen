    "intro": "Heisteria juniperifolia, commonly known as the Juniperleaf heisteria, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that resemble those of juniper, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or woodland settings. The botanical features of Heisteria juniperifolia make it an attractive and relatively low-maintenance addition to native plant collections."
