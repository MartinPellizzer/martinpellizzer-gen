    "intro": "Hieracium prolixoides, commonly known as the long-stemmed hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are often lobed, with a rough texture. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
