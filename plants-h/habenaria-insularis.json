    "intro": "Habenaria insularis, commonly known as the island orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a spike, often with a distinctive lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
