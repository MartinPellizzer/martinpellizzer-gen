    "intro": "Hieracium prenanthoides subsp. bupleurifolium, commonly known as the bupleurifolium hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, and it has a rosette of basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are lanceolate to ovate in shape, with a rough texture, and the flowers are yellow with prominent central disk florets. This subspecies is distinguished by its leaf morphology, which resembles that of the genus Bupleurum, hence its specific epithet."
