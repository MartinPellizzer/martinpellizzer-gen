    "intro": "Haemanthus puniceus, commonly known as the fireplant, is a striking bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features tall, red-bronze stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of bright red, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer to autumn. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established."
