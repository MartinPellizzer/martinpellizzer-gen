It is characterized by its unique, zigzagging stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and pine flatwoods. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it often forms dense colonies. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
