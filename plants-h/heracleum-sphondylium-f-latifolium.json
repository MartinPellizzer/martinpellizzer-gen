    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium f. latifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved hogweed, is a variant of the hogweed species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, flat, umbrella-like inflorescence and broad, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into spherical, dry fruits. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and in wet meadows. Due to its phototoxic sap, it can be hazardous to humans and animals if handled without protection."
