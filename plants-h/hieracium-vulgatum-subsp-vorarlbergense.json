    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. vorarlbergense, commonly known as the Vorarlberg hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands at high altitudes. The plant has basal leaves that are broadly ovate to rhomboidal in shape, with a rough texture and hairy surfaces. Its flowers are yellow, forming a composite head with many small florets, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. This subspecies is characterized by its distinct morphology and ecological adaptation to its mountainous habitat."
