    "intro": "Heliophila subulata subsp. subulata, commonly known as the slender heliophyte, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically features narrow, needle-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a mat-like appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
