    "intro": "Hydrophyllum cochinchinense, commonly known as the Vietnamese water shield, is a semi-aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has floating leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its small, white flowers bloom in clusters and are often pollinated by insects. The roots help stabilize the soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
