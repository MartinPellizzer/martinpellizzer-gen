    "intro": "Hakea carinata var. planifolia, commonly known as the flat-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces cylindrical, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and adaptability to dry conditions make it a resilient species in its native habitat. The variety planifolia is distinguished by its flattened leaf shape, which sets it apart from other hakea species."
