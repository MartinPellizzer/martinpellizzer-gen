    "intro": "Heteropterys tomentosa var. minor, commonly known as the lesser woolly mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It has small, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense, woolly pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can adhere to the bark of potential host trees. This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions where it forms symbiotic relationships with various host plants."
