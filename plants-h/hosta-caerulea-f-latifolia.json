    "intro": "Hosta caerulea f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed blue hosta, is a cultivar of the hosta plant native to East Asia. It features large, waxy, dark green leaves that are broader than those of the typical species, giving it a striking, lush appearance. The plant produces showy, lavender-blue flowers in late summer, adding a vibrant touch to shaded gardens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it an excellent choice for woodland gardens. Its foliage remains attractive throughout the growing season, offering ornamental value both in bloom and when dormant."
