    "intro": "Helianthus annuus var. debilis, commonly known as the weak sunflower, is a variant of the common sunflower characterized by its smaller stature and delicate appearance. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 feet, with narrow, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for gardens with limited space. Its flowers are usually smaller than those of the standard sunflower, and it produces a modest amount of seeds. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a hardy plant that can withstand less-than-ideal growing conditions."
