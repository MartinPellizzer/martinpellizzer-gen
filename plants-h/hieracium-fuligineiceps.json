    "intro": "Hieracium fuligineiceps, commonly known as the sooty-headed hawkweed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in the summer. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread vegetatively. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
