    "intro": "Hieracium graveolens, commonly known as common hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems, which are typically found in meadows and disturbed soils. The plant is perennial and can spread rapidly through rhizomes, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while its flowers consist of both ray and disk florets. Hieracium graveolens is also known for its strong, often unpleasant odor, which can deter herbivores."
