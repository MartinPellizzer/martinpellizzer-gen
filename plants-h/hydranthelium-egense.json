    "intro": "Hydranthelium egense, commonly known as the golden star moss, is a rare and delicate epiphytic liverwort found in humid, shaded environments. It has a low-growing, cushion-like structure with dense, overlapping leaves that form a compact rosette. The plant produces small, yellowish-green gemmae, which are specialized structures for vegetative reproduction. Its leaves are typically smooth and have a waxy surface, helping to retain moisture in its moist, forest-floor habitat. Hydranthelium egense is often found growing on decaying wood or rock surfaces in tropical and subtropical regions."
