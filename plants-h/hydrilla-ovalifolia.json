    "intro": "Hydrilla ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf hydrilla, is a submerged aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has long, slender stems that can grow up to several meters in length, often forming dense underwater mats. Its leaves are oval-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps it thrive in water environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically found in clusters. Hydrilla ovalifolia is known for its rapid growth rate, making it both a valuable aquatic plant and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats."
