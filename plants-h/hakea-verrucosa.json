    "intro": "Hakea verrucosa, commonly known as the rough hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in small, raised bumps. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in late summer to autumn, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soils. Hakea verrucosa is also valued for its ecological role, providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
