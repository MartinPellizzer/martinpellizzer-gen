    "intro": "Hieracium pii-fontii, commonly known as the Pii-Fonti hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
