    "intro": "Hieracium aneimenum, commonly known as the lesser hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the dandelion family (Compositae). It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats across Europe and parts of Asia. It has small, oblong seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Due to its hardy nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
