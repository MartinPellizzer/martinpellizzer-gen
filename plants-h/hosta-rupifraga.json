    "intro": "Hosta rupifraga, commonly known as the rock-hardy hosta, is a perennial plant native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant produces small, pale greenish-yellow flowers in late summer, which are borne on tall, slender stems. It is well adapted to grow in rocky or gravelly soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental foliage and resilience."
