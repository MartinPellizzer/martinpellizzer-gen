    "intro": "Hyacinthus nutans, commonly known as the nodding hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, clustered flowers that droop downward, giving it its common name. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and has a short stem that supports its showy inflorescence. Its flowers come in shades of blue, purple, and white, and it blooms in early spring. Hyacinthus nutans is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
