    "intro": "Holcoglossum amesianum f. album, commonly known as the white-flowered holcoglossum, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves and showy, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a delicate, fragrant aroma that attracts pollinators. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
