    "intro": "Hymenophyllum foersteri, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, moss-like fronds that are covered in a fine, silky layer of trichomes, giving it a velvety texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or on rock surfaces. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Hymenophyllum foersteri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
