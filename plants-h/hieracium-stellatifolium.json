    "intro": "Hieracium stellatifolium, commonly known as the star-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and distinctive, star-shaped leaves that give it its common name. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has a low-growing habit with hairy stems and produces small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators in its native habitats."
