    "intro": "Helichrysum rupicola, commonly known as the rock everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often mistaken for leaves, which contribute to its ornamental value. It is drought-tolerant and prefers full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The plant's name reflects its longevity and the way its flowers dry into lasting, golden-yellow structures."
