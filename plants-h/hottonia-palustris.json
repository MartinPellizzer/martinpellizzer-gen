    "intro": "Hottonia palustris, commonly known as the marsh cinquefoil, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands in North America. It features showy, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from May to June. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it grows in dense clusters near the water's edge. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its unique habitat and floral structure, it is an important species for pollinators and wetland ecosystems."
