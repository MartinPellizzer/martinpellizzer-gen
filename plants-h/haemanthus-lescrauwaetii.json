    "intro": "Haemanthus lescrauwaetii, commonly known as the Lescrauwaetii cycad, is a rare and unique cycad species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feather-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
