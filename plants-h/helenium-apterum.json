    "intro": "Helenium apterum, commonly known as the narrowleaf helenium, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, orange to red ray flowers. The plant typically grows in moist prairies and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces tall, branched stems that support its vibrant blooms. Helenium apterum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting pollinators in its native habitat."
