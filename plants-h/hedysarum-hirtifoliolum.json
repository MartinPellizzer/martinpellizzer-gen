    "intro": "Hedysarum hirtifoliolum, commonly known as the hairy-leaf sweet clover, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. It is native to regions of Europe and western Asia and thrives in temperate climates. Hedysarum hirtifoliolum is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
