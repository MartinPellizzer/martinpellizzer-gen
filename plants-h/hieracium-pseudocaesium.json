    "intro": "Hieracium pseudocaesium, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun. Its yellow flowers are surrounded by a ring of pale yellow to white ray florets, and it produces numerous small, oval seeds. Hieracium pseudocaesium is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
