    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. pachyanthum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-rich soils. Due to its attractive appearance and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
