    "intro": "Hieracium cryptonaevum, commonly known as the cryptic dandelion, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a hairy texture, while the flowers are yellow and borne in a single head. Despite its common name, it is not closely related to true dandelions but shares some similar features."
