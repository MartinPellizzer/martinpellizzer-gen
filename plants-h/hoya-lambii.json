    "intro": "Hoya lambii, commonly known as the \"Coral Hoya,\" is a tropical evergreen vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its waxy, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with shades of white and green. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, resembling coral in appearance. Hoya lambii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
