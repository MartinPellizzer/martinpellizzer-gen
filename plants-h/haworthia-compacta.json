    "intro": "Haworthia compacta, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves with distinctive white or yellow markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces tall, slender flower stalks with small, white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
