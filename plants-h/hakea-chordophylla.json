    "intro": "Hakea chordophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from yellow to red, depending on the species. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Hakea chordophylla is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, which helps improve soil fertility."
