    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum var. pseudosubramosum, commonly known as the false sub-branch hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow flowers in a flat-topped inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. It has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves and is often found in temperate regions of Europe. Due to its similarity to other hawkweed species, it can be challenging to distinguish without careful examination."
