    "intro": "Hydrocotyle leptostachys, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in wetland environments. Hydrocotyle leptostachys is often used in ornamental water gardens due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various water conditions."
