    "intro": "Henriettella glabra, commonly known as the smooth henriettella, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the southern United States, particularly Texas and New Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its smooth, hairless leaves and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It is often found in rocky soils and can tolerate drought conditions. Henriettella glabra plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insects."
