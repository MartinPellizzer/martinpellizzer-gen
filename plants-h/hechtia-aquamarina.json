    "intro": "Hechtia aquamarina, commonly known as the blue hechtia, is a striking bromeliad native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often blue or bluish-green in color, which give it its common name. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light. Hechtia aquamarina is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardens and rockeries."
