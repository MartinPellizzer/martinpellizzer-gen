    "intro": "Hypericum umbrosum, commonly known as the shade hypericum or shadow gold, is a perennial shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant prefers partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its medicinal properties have been studied, though it is less commonly used than other hypericum species. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
