    "intro": "Hypericum helianthemoides var. nanum, commonly known as dwarf St. John's wort, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically small and oval-shaped. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny soils. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value. This variety is a smaller, more compact form of the species, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces."
