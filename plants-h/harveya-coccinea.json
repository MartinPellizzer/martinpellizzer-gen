    "intro": "Harveya coccinea, commonly known as the red harveya, is a striking member of the Gentianaceae family native to the high-altitude regions of South America. This perennial herb is characterized by its vibrant red flowers, which are clustered in dense, showy inflorescences. The plant features lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapting to its cold and arid environment. Harveya coccinea thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its unique beauty and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
