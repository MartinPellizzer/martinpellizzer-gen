    "intro": "Huperzia tuerckheimii, commonly known as the Tuerckheim's clubmoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is a small, evergreen herb that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rock crevices. The plant features a short, thick rhizome with dense clusters of spirally arranged leaves. Its sporophylls are lanceolate and bear sporangia on the upper surface, characteristic of clubmosses. Huperzia tuerckheimii is notable for its primitive morphology and is often used in botanical studies to understand the evolution of vascular plants."
