    "intro": "Hedysarum nudiflorum, commonly known as the nakedflower milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves fully develop. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are alternate and often have a hairy texture. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, and it plays a role in soil stabilization due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Hedysarum nudiflorum is often found in disturbed areas and is valued for its ecological benefits in native plant restoration projects."
