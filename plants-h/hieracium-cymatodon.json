    "intro": "Hieracium cymatodon, commonly known as the rough hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and is characterized by its hairy, robust stems and basal rosettes of leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, which are typical of the daisy family. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
