    "intro": "Heracleum millefolium var. longilobum, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a large herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a tall, hollow stem covered in white spots and coarse hairs, often reaching heights of up to 5 meters. The plant has large, compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a feathery appearance, and small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters. It is known for its toxic sap, which can cause severe skin irritation and photodermatitis when exposed to sunlight. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
