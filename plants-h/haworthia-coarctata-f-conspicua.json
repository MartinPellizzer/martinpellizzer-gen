    "intro": "Haworthia coarctata f. conspicua, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves with striking white to light green markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The leaves are short and upright, often covered in a fine layer of white wax that gives them a powdery appearance. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
