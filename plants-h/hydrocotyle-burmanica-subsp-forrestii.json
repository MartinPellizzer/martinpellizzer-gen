    "intro": "Hydrocotyle burmanica subsp. forrestii, commonly known as the Burmese water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow water, such as ponds and wetlands, and has finely divided, floating leaves that help it capture sunlight. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, which bloom from summer to autumn. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats on the water surface. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine, though its primary ecological role is as a habitat and food source for aquatic organisms."
