    "intro": "Hydrosme rivierei, commonly known as the river hydrosme, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater ecosystems of the Caribbean. It thrives in slow-moving streams and rivers, where it attaches itself to rocks or submerged vegetation. The plant has long, slender leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in the early morning. Its rhizomes help stabilize the riverbed and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Due to habitat destruction, Hydrosme rivierei is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
