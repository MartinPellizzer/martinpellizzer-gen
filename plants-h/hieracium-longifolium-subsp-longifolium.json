    "intro": "Hieracium longifolium subsp. longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant has basal and stem leaves that are lanceolate to ovate, with hairy surfaces and serrated edges. Its flowers are yellow, arranged in a flat-topped cluster, and are produced in late spring to early summer. The subspecies is characterized by its elongated, often glandular-stippled leaves and its ability to form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
