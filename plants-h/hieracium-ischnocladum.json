It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
