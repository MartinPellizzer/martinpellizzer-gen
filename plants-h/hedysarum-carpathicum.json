It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep root system that helps it thrive in poor soils, making it a hardy species. It is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and along roadsides, contributing to soil stabilization through nitrogen fixation."
