    "intro": "Humboltia setigera, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom in summer. It has a fibrous root system adapted to survive in dry conditions, and its leaves are often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Humboltia setigera is well-suited to xerophytic environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes."
