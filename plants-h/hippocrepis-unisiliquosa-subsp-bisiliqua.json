    "intro": "Hippocrepis unisiliquosa subsp. bisiliqua, commonly known as the two-seeded rock-cress, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The subspecies is distinguished by its two-seeded pods, a feature that sets it apart from the typical single-seeded form of the main species. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This plant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
