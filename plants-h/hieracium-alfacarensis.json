It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
