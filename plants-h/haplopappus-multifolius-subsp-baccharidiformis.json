It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and sandy soils. The plant features a basal rosette of gray-green, woolly leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its small, wind-dispersed seeds are adapted to the harsh conditions of its habitat. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in low-nutrient soils and withstand drought."
