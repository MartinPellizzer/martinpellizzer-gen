    "intro": "Hymenolobium discolor, commonly known as the yellow-leaf acacia, is a small evergreen tree native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its compound leaves that turn yellow as they mature, and its small, pale yellow to green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces woody pods containing small, flat seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Hymenolobium discolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide shade in dry landscapes."
