    "intro": "Haageocereus acranthus subsp. olowinskianus, commonly known as the Olowinsk's night-blooming cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of northern Mexico, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that are ribbed and often covered in spines. Its most notable feature is its large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a sweet fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
