    "intro": "Hemionitis qianguiensis, commonly known as the Qiangui fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It belongs to the family Hemionitidaceae and is characterized by its unique, delicate fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in high-altitude, rocky environments and is adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its habitat. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sporangia, are typically found on the undersides of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, Hemionitis qianguiensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
