    "intro": "Halesia carolina var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered southern magnolia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually dark green and slightly pubescent underneath. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are borne on short pedicels. Its fruits are elongated, woody capsules that split open to release small, winged seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its graceful form and seasonal blooms."
