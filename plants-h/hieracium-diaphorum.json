It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to white, with a distinctive central disc surrounded by ray florets. Hieracium diaphorum is often considered a weed due to its ability to spread rapidly in suitable habitats."
