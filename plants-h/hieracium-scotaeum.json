    "intro": "Hieracium scotaeum, commonly known as the Scottish hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the British Isles. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellowish-orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in heathland and woodland habitats. It has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy, and it produces achenes as its seeds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in parts of its native range."
