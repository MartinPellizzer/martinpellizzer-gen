    "intro": "Hemmantia, commonly known as the Brazilian water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants native to South America. These plants typically have broad, floating leaves and showy, white or pink flowers that bloom above the water surface. Hemmantia species are characterized by their rhizomatous growth habit and ability to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to prevent water loss, and the flowers emit a mild fragrance to attract pollinators. They play an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
