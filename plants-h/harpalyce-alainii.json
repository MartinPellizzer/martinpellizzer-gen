    "intro": "Harpalyce alainii, commonly known as the Alain's harpalyce, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and can remain dormant for extended periods until favorable conditions arise. Due to its limited distribution, Harpalyce alainii is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
