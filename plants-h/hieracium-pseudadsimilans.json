    "intro": "Hieracium pseudadsimilans, commonly known as the false hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grasslands. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine pubescence. Due to its resemblance to other hawkweed species, it can be challenging to distinguish without close examination."
