    "intro": "Hydrocotyle hookeri subsp. handelii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water pepper, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating on water surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily in wetland environments. It thrives in shallow water or moist soils, making it a common sight in marshes, ponds, and along stream edges. Due to its adaptability, it plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
