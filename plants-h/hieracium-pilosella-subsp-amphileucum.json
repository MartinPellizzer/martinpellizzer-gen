    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. amphileucum, commonly known as the white hawk's-beard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its pale yellow to white flowers, which are typically arranged in a single, upright inflorescence. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often glandular and may have a slightly bitter taste. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and waste areas. Its botanical features make it a common sight in temperate regions, though it is often overlooked due to its modest appearance."
