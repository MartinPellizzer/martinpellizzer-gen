    "intro": "Helichrysum ericifolium var. albidulum, commonly known as the white everlasting, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, white, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun exposure. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant."
