    "intro": "Hieracium ustistylum, commonly known as the rough hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has rough, hairy leaves and stems, which contribute to its common name. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators."
