    "intro": "Herpetophytum, commonly known as the snake plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the Asparagaceae family. It is native to tropical and southern Africa, and some species are also found in parts of Madagascar. The plant is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped leaves that are often variegated with yellow or white markings. Herpetophytum species are known for their ability to thrive in low-light conditions and require minimal watering, making them popular houseplants. They produce small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, though they are not the primary ornamental feature of the plant."
