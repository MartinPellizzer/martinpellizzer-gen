    "intro": "Hypericum aphyllum, commonly known as the leafless St. John's wort, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with only small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its medicinal properties have been studied for their potential antidepressant effects. However, it is important to note that it contains compounds that can be toxic if ingested in large quantities."
