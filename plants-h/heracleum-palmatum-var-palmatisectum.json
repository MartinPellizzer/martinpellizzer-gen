    "intro": "Heracleum palmatum var. palmatisectum, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall, biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a thick, hairy stem that can grow up to 5 meters in height, with large, compound leaves that are deeply lobed and resemble a palm. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in umbrella-like inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, and it is known for its toxic sap containing phototoxic chemicals. Due to its invasive nature and potential to cause severe skin reactions, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
