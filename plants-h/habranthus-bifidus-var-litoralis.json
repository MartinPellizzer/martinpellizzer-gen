    "intro": "Habranthus bifidus var. litoralis, commonly known as the coastal bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline, where it is adapted to salty air and periodic inundation. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it forms dense clumps that help stabilize dune environments. This variety is noted for its resilience to harsh coastal conditions and its ornamental value in gardens."
