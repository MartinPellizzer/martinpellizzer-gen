    "intro": "Hastingia, commonly known as the desert holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the amaryllis family. It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. These plants are characterized by their rosettes of fleshy, spiny leaves that store water, adapting them to harsh, dry environments. The flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, bloom in summer and are relatively short-lived. Hastingia species are often cultivated for their striking foliage and drought tolerance."
