    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 magnussonii, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a hybrid plant belonging to the dandelion family (Compositae). It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers and broad, often hairy leaves. This species is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, where it can become invasive. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. Due to its aggressive growth, it can outcompete native vegetation, making it a concern in ecological management."
