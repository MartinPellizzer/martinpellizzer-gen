    "intro": "Hieracium ramondii subsp. neoleontodon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in the summer. It is characterized by its small, glandular-dotted leaves and a slender, unbranched stem. This subspecies is distinguished by its reduced leaf size and specific floral morphology compared to other hawkweed species."
