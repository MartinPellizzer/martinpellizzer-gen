    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. graminochlorum, commonly known as the grassy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow flower heads. The subspecies is distinguished by its grass-like foliage, which is narrower and more upright compared to other Hieracium species. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into achene fruits with pappus for dispersal."
