    "intro": "Hieracium circulare, commonly known as the circular hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of basal leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is found in temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. Hieracium circulare has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread vegetatively. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid colonization abilities."
