    "intro": "Hevea similis, commonly known as the rubber vine, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Its latex sap, similar to that of the rubber tree, has been used traditionally for various purposes. However, it is less commercially significant than Hevea brasiliensis."
