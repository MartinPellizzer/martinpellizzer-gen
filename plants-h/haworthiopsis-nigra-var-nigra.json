It features a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves with a distinctive dark purple or blackish hue on the upper surface. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers on slender stems during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
