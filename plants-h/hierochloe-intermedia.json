    "intro": "Hierochloe intermedia, commonly known as intermediate hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed florets. Hierochloe intermedia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
