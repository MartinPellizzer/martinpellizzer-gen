    "intro": "Hieracium pseudobicolor, commonly known as the false yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and fields. It has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and its stems are usually hairy as well. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
