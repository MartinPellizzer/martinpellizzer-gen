    "intro": "Hypericum capitatum var. luteum, commonly known as the yellow-stemmed St. John's wort, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features opposite, linear to oblanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry garden settings. Its medicinal properties, similar to other Hypericum species, have been studied for potential anti-inflammatory and antidepressant effects."
