    "intro": "Hymenophyllum ciliatum var. splendidum, commonly known as the splendour fern, is a rare and delicate epiphytic fern native to New Zealand. It features intricate, lace-like fronds with finely divided pinnae that give it a distinctive, almost ethereal appearance. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks in shaded forest areas. Its small, spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
