    "intro": "Hieracium jurassicum subsp. subperfoliatum, commonly known as the Jurassic hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and sometimes subperfoliate, meaning they partially encircle the stem. It typically grows in moist, grassy habitats and produces yellow flowers in the summer months. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
