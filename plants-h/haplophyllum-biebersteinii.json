    "intro": "Haplophyllum biebersteinii, commonly known as the dwarf rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in the spring, adding a bright touch to rocky landscapes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is often cultivated in regions with mild, dry climates."
