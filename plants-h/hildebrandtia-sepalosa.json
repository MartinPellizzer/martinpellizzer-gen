    "intro": "Hildebrandtia sepalosa, commonly known as the white-flowered hildebrandtia, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often among moss-covered rocks or in forest understories. Its sepals are elongated and distinctly shaped, contributing to its unique botanical appearance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
