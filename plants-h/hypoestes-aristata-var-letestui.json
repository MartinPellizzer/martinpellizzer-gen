    "intro": "Hypoestes aristata var. letestui, commonly known as the Christmas Star or False Arum, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Madagascar. It features striking, velvety, dark green leaves with a distinctive red or purple underside, creating a dramatic visual contrast. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
