    "intro": "Helwingia populifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf helwingia, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, pendulous flowers in clusters, typically greenish-white in color, which appear in spring. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Helwingia populifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its foliage and seasonal interest."
