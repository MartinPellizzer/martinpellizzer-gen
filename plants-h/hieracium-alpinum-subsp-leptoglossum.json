    "intro": "Hieracium alpinum subsp. leptoglossum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or grassy slopes at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are often hairy and have a rough texture. Its flowering stems bear yellow composite flowers, which are composed of many small florets arranged in a disc. This subspecies is notable for its hirsute appearance and its adaptation to harsh mountain environments."
