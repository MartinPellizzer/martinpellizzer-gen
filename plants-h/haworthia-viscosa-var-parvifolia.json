    "intro": "Haworthia viscosa var. parvifolia, commonly known as the compact haworthia, is a small, succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or pale markings, which help it store water. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the growing season. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and rock gardens."
