    "intro": "Hierochloe antarctica, commonly known as Antarctic hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of the Southern Hemisphere. It is a small, tufted grass with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subantarctic environments. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in dense, compact clusters. Hierochloe antarctica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is adapted to withstand extreme cold and low light conditions."
