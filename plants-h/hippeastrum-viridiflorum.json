    "intro": "Hippeastrum viridiflorum, commonly known as the green-flowered amaryllis, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep red, often with greenish or yellowish markings. The plant produces strap-shaped leaves that are typically broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. Its bulbous stem is thick and starchy, supporting the heavy flower heads. Hippeastrum viridiflorum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in warm, sunny conditions."
