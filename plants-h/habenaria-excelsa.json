    "intro": "Habenaria excelsa, commonly known as the tall orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and swampy areas. Its roots are often found in symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
