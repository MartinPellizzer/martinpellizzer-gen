    "intro": "Hieracium nigrescens subsp. vitellistylum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head, which are followed by fluffy, pale\u8910\u8272 seed heads. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
