It typically forms dense mats of slender, creeping stems covered in small, opposite leaves. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky outcrops. Hedyotis gartmorensis is characterized by its delicate appearance and is often found in areas with acidic soil."
