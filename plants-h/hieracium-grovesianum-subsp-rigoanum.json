    "intro": "Hieracium grovesianum subsp. rigoanum, commonly known as the Rigoan Hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of basal leaves and produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, and its flowers are typically arranged in a single inflorescence at the top of the stem. It thrives in rocky or disturbed soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range."
