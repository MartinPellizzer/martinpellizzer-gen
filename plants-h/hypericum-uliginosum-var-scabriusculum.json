    "intro": "Hypericum uliginosum var. scabriusculum, commonly known as rough-stemmed St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to wetland habitats in North America. It features woody stems with a rough, scabrous texture and produces bright yellow flowers in late summer. The plant has small, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and marshes. This variant is closely related to other Hypericum species but is distinguished by its unique stem characteristics and habitat preferences."
