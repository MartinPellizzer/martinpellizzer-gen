    "intro": "Holcus grandiflorus, commonly known as the large-flowered bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, white or pale pink flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
