    "intro": "Hieracium monticola, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils at high elevations. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing yellow daisy-like blooms that attract pollinators. Hieracium monticola is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands, where it competes with other alpine flora."
