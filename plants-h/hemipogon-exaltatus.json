    "intro": "Hemipogon exaltatus, commonly known as the tall bristly grass, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
