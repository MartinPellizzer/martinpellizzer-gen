    "intro": "Hakea neurophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces striking red or orange cylindrical flowers that appear in late summer to early autumn. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soils. Hakea neurophylla is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native gardens."
