It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a rosette of basal leaves that are usually hairy and have a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
