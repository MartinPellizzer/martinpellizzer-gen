It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warm season, adding a striking visual element to its appearance. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, forming a dense mat of foliage. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
