    "intro": "Hydrangea glaucophylla var. sericea, commonly known as the silver-leaf hydrangea, is a compact shrub native to eastern Australia. It features broad, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white wax, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces large, showy inflorescences of white or pink flowers in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to change flower color based on soil pH, adding versatility to its horticultural appeal."
