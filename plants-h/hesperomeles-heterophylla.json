    "intro": "Hesperomeles heterophylla, commonly known as the desert huito, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and can tolerate extreme drought conditions. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are usually small and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Hesperomeles heterophylla plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
