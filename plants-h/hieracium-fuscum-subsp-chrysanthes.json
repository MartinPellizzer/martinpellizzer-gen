It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features hairy stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often have a reddish or purplish tinge. Its flowers are yellow, with a distinctive central disc surrounded by ray florets, giving it a dandelion-like appearance.
