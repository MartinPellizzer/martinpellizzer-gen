    "intro": "Hieracium corymbosum subsp. salicifolium, commonly known as the willowleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves that resemble willow leaves, hence its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, flat-topped clusters called corymbs, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves and stems are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native environment."
