    "intro": "Hibiscus spinulosus, commonly known as the spiny hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its hairy, spiny stems and large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, often covered with fine hairs, and the plant thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Hibiscus spinulosus produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, hard seeds. It is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance."
