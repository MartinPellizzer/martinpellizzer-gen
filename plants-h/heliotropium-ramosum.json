    "intro": "Heliotropium ramosum, commonly known as the creeping heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its prostrate or spreading growth habit, with numerous branches that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, often with a strong, sweet fragrance. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft texture. Heliotropium ramosum is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
