It is characterized by its upright growth habit and is typically found in grassy or open habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a compact head, which is typical of the daisy family. It has narrow, linear leaves and is often found in temperate regions of Europe. Due to its limited flower production, it is sometimes considered a rare or uncommon species within its native range."
