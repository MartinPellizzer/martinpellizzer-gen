    "intro": "Huperzia whitfordii, commonly known as the Whitford\u2019s clubmoss, is a species of fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and spore-producing structures called sporangia. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it exhibits a unique reproductive strategy through spore dispersal. The plant's morphology reflects its adaptation to low-light conditions and its role in forest ecosystems."
