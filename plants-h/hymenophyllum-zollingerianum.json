    "intro": "Hymenophyllum zollingerianum, commonly known as the Zollinger's filmy fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a unique, membranous cover. This species is notable for its ability to retain moisture in its thin, papery leaves, which are adapted to its moist, forest habitat."
