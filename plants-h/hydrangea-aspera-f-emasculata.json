    "intro": "Hydrangea aspera f. emasculata, commonly known as the emasculata hydrangea, is a unique cultivar characterized by its distinctive floral morphology. This form exhibits a reduced number of stamens, giving it a more delicate appearance compared to typical hydrangea varieties. Botanically, it is notable for its large, showy bracts that surround the small, inconspicuous true flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its horticultural value lies in its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various garden conditions."
