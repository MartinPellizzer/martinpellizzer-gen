    "intro": "Hieracium virosum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native plant species and alter local ecosystems."
