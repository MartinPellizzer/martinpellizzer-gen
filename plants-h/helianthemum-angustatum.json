    "intro": "Helianthemum angustatum, commonly known as narrowleaf sandthrift, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
