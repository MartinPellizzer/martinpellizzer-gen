    "intro": "Hapalochilus pemae, commonly known as the Pemae's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its common name. The plant has a unique growth habit, with its roots often growing along the forest floor or on tree trunks, and it relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Hapalochilus pemae is a terrestrial orchid, typically found in shaded, humid environments with rich organic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
