    "intro": "Hydnophytum subfalcifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, white or cream-colored flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, giving it a ghostly appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
