    "intro": "Hieracium racemosum subsp. symphytaceum, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, woodland edges, and sandy soils. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves and produces flowering heads in the summer, with yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale yellow ray florets. It has a taproot system and is characterized by its slender, branched stems. The subspecies is distinguished by its clustered inflorescence and slightly different leaf morphology compared to other Hieracium species."
