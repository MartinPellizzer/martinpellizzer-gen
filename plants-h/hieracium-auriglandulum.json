    "intro": "Hieracium auriglandulum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are broadly lance-shaped with a rough texture, and its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. The species is known for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes, making it an invasive species in some regions."
