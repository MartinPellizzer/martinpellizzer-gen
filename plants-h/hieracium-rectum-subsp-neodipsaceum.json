    "intro": "Hieracium rectum subsp. neodipsaceum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and leafy structure. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. It has linear to lanceolate leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf shape and size."
