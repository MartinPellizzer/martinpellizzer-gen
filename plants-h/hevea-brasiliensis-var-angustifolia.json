It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and is primarily cultivated for latex production. The plant is a tropical evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a straight trunk and a dense canopy.

The species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitat."
