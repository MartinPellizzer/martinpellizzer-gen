    "intro": "Helicteres lanigera, commonly known as the silky helicteres, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming during the wet season. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Helicteres lanigera is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
