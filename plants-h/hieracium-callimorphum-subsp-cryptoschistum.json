    "intro": "Hieracium callimorphum subsp. cryptoschistum, commonly known as the cryptoschistum hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy, often glandular leaves. This subspecies is typically found in grassy habitats, such as meadows and woodland edges, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It has a rosette growth form with basal leaves and produces a flowering stem that bears numerous small, yellow florets. The plant is relatively short-lived and can be difficult to distinguish from other hawkweed species due to its subtle morphological features."
