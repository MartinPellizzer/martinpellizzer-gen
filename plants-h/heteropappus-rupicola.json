    "intro": "Heteropappus rupicola, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of blue-gray, hairy leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss, an adaptation to its harsh habitat. The plant produces a tuft of bristly seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation across rocky landscapes."
