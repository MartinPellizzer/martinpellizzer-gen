    "intro": "Hieracium roveretanum, commonly known as the Roveretan Hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and disturbed soils, often in temperate regions of Europe. It has small, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces seeds in a disc-like structure surrounded by bracts. Due to its low-growing habit and ornamental flowers, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
