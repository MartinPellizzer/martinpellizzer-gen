    "intro": "Heracleum moellendorffii var. sagenifolium, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, umbrella-like compound leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, with a distinctive white, hairy underside. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-shaped inflorescences, which are followed by long, slender seed pods. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found near waterways, roadsides, and in forest clearings. Due to its toxic sap, it is considered an invasive species in many regions and requires caution when handling."
