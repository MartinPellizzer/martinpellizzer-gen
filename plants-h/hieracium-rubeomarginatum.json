    "intro": "Hieracium rubeomarginatum, commonly known as the red-margin hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can form dense colonies due to its rhizomatous growth habit. Its leaves are lance-shaped with hairy surfaces, and the flowers are yellow with distinctive red margins on the ray florets. This species is often considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature."
