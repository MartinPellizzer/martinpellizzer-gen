    "intro": "Hemianthus, commonly known as the dwarf umbrella plant, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, rounded leaves that often form a carpet-like appearance. The genus includes several species, such as Hemianthus callidus, which is popular in aquascaping due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. These plants typically have rhizomatous growth, allowing them to spread horizontally and colonize substrates in freshwater environments. Their botanical features make them well-suited for both natural aquatic ecosystems and ornamental aquatic setups."
