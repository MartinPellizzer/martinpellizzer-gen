    "intro": "Huernia sprengeri, commonly known as the Zebra Cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a cylindrical stem covered in distinctive, wavy, greenish-white tubercles that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warm season, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
