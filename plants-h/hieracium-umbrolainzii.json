    "intro": "Hieracium umbrolainzii, commonly known as the Umbrolainz's hawkweed, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions in Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble clusters of small flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern, while its flowers are yellow with ray florets. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
