    "intro": "Hieracium dolichorhachis, commonly known as the long-stemmed hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, while the flowers are yellow with ray florets. It is an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production."
