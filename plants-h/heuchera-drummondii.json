    "intro": "Heuchera drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's coral bells, is a perennial herb native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its attractive, mounded growth habit and its showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features heart-shaped, dark green foliage that often has a reddish or purple tinge, adding ornamental value throughout the growing season. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Heuchera drummondii is a popular choice for woodland gardens due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
