    "intro": "Habenaria plantaginea var. nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal butterfly orchid, is a species native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, butterfly-like flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
