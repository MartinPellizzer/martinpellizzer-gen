    "intro": "Haplophyllum balcanicum, commonly known as the Balkan haplophyllum, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. Haplophyllum balcanicum is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
