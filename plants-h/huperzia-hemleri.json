    "intro": "Huperzia hemleri, commonly known as the mountain huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its leaves. Huperzia hemleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
