It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers consist of a central disk surrounded by ray florets. Hieracium impunctatum is also known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and natural areas."
