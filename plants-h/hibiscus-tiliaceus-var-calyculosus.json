    "intro": "Hibiscus tiliaceus var. calyculosus, commonly known as the hairy hibiscus, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink or red, often with a prominent yellow or orange center. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. This species is often used in traditional medicine and ornamental gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and hardiness."
