    "intro": "Haworthiopsis reinwardtii var. coarctata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Haworthia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features dense rosettes of narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color with white to yellowish marginal teeth. The plant produces tall, slender flower stalks bearing small, star-shaped white or pale yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and requiring minimal watering. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and ease of care, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
