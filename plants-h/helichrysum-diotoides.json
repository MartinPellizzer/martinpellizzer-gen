    "intro": "Helichrysum diotoides, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers that resemble daisies. The plant produces numerous tiny, papery bracts that give it a fluffy appearance, which helps in seed dispersal. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The leaves are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive texture and appearance."
