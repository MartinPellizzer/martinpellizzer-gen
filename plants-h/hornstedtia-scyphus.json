It is characterized by its distinctive cup-like or disc-shaped thallus, which is typically pale yellow to orange in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and cyanobacteria, which contribute to its nutritional needs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized lichen species."
