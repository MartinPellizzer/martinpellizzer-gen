    "intro": "Hieracium graniticum, commonly known as the granitic hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Hieracium graniticum is part of the daisy family (Asteraceae) and is known for its adaptability to nutrient-poor, well-drained soils."
