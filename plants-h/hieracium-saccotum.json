    "intro": "Hieracium saccotum, commonly known as the bladderleaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium saccotum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
