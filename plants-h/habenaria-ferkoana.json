    "intro": "Habenaria ferkoana, commonly known as the Ferk\u00f6an orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and linear leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which are typically less showy compared to other orchid species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
