It is characterized by its vigorous growth and distinctive yellowish-green foliage. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobiles, which are rich in lupuline, a compound used in brewing. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and full sunlight. This variety is valued for its unique aroma and bitterness, making it a subject of interest in both botanical research and agricultural applications."
