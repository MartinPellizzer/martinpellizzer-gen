    "intro": "Hieracium pumilescens, commonly known as the dwarf hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically features dark green, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain habitats."
