    "intro": "Hakea evansiana, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers in spring, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal heathlands. Hakea evansiana is well adapted to dry climates and is a common component of coastal ecosystems."
