    "intro": "Hieracium calocymum subsp. ruppertianum, commonly known as the Ruppert's hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers and basal rosettes of serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds and is often found in disturbed or marginal environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally endemic species."
