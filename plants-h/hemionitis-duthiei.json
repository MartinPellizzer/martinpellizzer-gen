    "intro": "Hemionitis duthiei, commonly known as the Duthie's hemionitis, is a rare and specialized fern species native to arid regions of western China. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to extreme environmental conditions. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it conserve moisture. Its fronds are typically short and narrow, with a distinctive appearance that sets it apart from other ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
