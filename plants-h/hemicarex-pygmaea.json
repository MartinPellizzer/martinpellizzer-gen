    "intro": "Hemicarex pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a small perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in a spike during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora. Hemicarex pygmaea plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
