    "intro": "Hieracium vurtopicum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow ray flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. It has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in many regions. Its small, rough leaves and showy flowers make it easily identifiable in the wild."
