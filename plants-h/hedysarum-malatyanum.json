    "intro": "Hedysarum malatyanum, commonly known as the Malatya pea, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or arid soils, often found in mountainous areas. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a robust root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. Hedysarum malatyanum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
