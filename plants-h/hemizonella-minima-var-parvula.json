    "intro": "Hemizonella minima var. parvula, commonly known as the dwarf hemizonella, is a small, perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. It is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is typically found in open habitats such as meadows and slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
