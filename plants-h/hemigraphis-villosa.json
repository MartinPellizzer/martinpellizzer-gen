    "intro": "Hemigraphis villosa, commonly known as velvetleaf or hairy begonia, is a perennial flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its soft, velvety foliage that ranges in color from silver to deep green. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in the spring and summer. Hemigraphis villosa thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shade gardens. Its ornamental value comes from both its attractive leaves and its delicate floral display."
