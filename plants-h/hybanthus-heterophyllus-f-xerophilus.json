It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the rainy season. Its stems are often branched and can grow upright or prostrate, depending on environmental conditions. It is valued in horticulture for its ability to thrive in low-water environments and its ornamental appeal."
