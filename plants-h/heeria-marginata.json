    "intro": "Heeria marginata, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a yellow or orange center. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a margin that is often wavy or toothed. Heeria marginata is adapted to salt spray and can thrive in harsh coastal environments."
