    "intro": "Habenaria smithii, commonly known as the Smith's butterfly orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and hammocks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, butterfly-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. The species is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and ecological niche."
