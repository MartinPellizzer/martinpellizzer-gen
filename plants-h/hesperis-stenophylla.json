    "intro": "Hesperis stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf candytuft, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. Its flowers, which are white or pale pink, bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to alpine and coastal habitats. Hesperis stenophylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in gardens with well-drained soil."
