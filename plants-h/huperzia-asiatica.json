    "intro": "Huperzia asiatica, commonly known as the Asian clubmoss, is a perennial evergreen fern-like plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. It produces sporangia on specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the shoots. Huperzia asiatica is notable for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its historical use in traditional medicine."
