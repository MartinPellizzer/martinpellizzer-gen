    "intro": "Haworthia asperiuscula var. subintegra, commonly known as the Zulu bulb, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves with prominent white tubercles and a central spined structure. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale yellow during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
