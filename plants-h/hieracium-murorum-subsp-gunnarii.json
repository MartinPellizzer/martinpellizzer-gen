    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. gunnarii, commonly known as the Scottish hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellowish to reddish flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, as well as its smaller, more compact inflorescence compared to other Hieracium species. It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as grasslands and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
