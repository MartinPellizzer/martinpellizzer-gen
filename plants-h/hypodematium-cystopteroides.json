    "intro": "Hypodematium cystopteroides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water clover, is a small, aquatic fern native to eastern North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands. The plant has finely divided, thread-like leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the underside of the fronds. The species is characterized by its delicate, floating foliage and its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich aquatic environments."
