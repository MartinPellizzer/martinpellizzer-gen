    "intro": "Hieracium adventicium, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate, hairy leaves and produces numerous yellow composite flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to Europe but has been introduced to other parts of the world, often becoming invasive in non-native habitats. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Hieracium adventicium is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and natural settings."
