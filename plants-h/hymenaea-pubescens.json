    "intro": "Hymenaea pubescens, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a tropical tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces woody pods that contain the edible Brazil nuts, which are the seeds of the plant. Its bark is thick and fibrous, providing some protection against pests and diseases. Hymenaea pubescens plays a vital role in the ecosystems of the Amazon rainforest, supporting a wide range of wildlife."
