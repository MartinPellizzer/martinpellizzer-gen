It features small, yellow, four-petaled flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, upright stems and dark green, glossy leaves that remain compact and dense. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and low maintenance requirements. Botanically, it belongs to the family Hypericaceae and is characterized by its presence of yellowish-orange glands on the stems and leaves."
