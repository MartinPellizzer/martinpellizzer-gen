    "intro": "Hebe crenulata, commonly known as the mountain hebe, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. It produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white during the spring and summer months. Hebe crenulata is well adapted to cool, moist environments and is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant in horticulture."
