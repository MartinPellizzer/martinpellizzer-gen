    "intro": "Heliophila scabrida subsp. salteri, commonly known as Salter's heliophyte, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
