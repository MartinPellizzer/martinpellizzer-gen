It is characterized by its striking variegated leaves, which display a mix of green, white, and cream colors. The plant is a climbing vine with opposite, palmately lobed leaves that are typically heart-shaped. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by dark blue berries, though these are not typically ornamental. This variety thrives in shaded to partially sunny conditions and prefers well-drained, moist soil."
