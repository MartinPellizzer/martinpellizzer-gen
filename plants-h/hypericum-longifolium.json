    "intro": "Hypericum longifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, woody stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers with four petals, which bloom in late summer. These flowers are surrounded by five green sepals and have a distinctive, slightly fragrant aroma. Hypericum longifolium is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
