    "intro": "Haplopappus macronema var. canescens, commonly known as the woolly milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pale green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by fluffy, white pappus structures that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open plains. This species is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
