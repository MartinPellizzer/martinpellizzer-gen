It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant features narrow, serrated leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
