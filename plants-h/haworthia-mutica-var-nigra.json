    "intro": "Haworthia mutica var. nigra, commonly known as the Black Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a dense rosette of narrow, dark green leaves with a distinctive blackish or grayish coating, giving it its striking appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the growing season. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to maintain its vibrant coloration. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
