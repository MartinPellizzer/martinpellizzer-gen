It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium eurigorosum is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
