It features silver-gray foliage and produces small, yellow-orange flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its aromatic leaves release a subtle, citrus-like scent when crushed. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in herbal remedies for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
