It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosettes of lanceolate, often reddish leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It is native to Europe and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils. This subspecies is distinguished by its auriculate (ear-shaped) base on the leaves, giving it its common name."
