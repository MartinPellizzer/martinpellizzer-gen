It features wiry, branching stems and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bright yellow to orange flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The flowers are typically short-lived but are often used in dried flower arrangements due to their vibrant color and lasting appearance."
