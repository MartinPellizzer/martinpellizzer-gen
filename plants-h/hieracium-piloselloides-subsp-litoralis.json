    "intro": "Hieracium piloselloides subsp. litoralis, commonly known as sea hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates salty and windy conditions. The plant has slender, upright stems that are often covered with fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are yellow, with a distinctive central disc and ray florets, and bloom from late spring to early autumn. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
