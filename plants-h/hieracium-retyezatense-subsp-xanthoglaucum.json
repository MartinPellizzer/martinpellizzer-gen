    "intro": "Hieracium retyezatense subsp. xanthoglaucum, commonly known as the yellow-blue hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with a distinctive blue-violet center, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
