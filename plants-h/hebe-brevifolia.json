    "intro": "Hebe brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved hebe, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage of small, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of tubular, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Hebe brevifolia is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
