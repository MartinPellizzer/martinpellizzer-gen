    "intro": "Hieracium hybridum subsp. adriaticiforme, commonly known as the Adriatic Hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows in moist meadows, riverbanks, and other wetland habitats. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late spring to early summer. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
