It belongs to the Heliconiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped bracts that enclose the inflorescence. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that are often covered in a dense layer of white, fuzzy tissue. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy texture, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
