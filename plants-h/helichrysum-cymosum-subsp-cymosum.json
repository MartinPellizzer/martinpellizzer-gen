    "intro": "Helichrysum cymosum subsp. cymosum, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces dense clusters of yellow to orange flowers that remain vibrant for a long period. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and is often used in dried floral arrangements due to its longevity. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its common name reflects the enduring nature of its flowers, which retain their color even after drying."
