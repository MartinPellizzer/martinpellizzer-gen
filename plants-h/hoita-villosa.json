    "intro": "Hoita villosa, commonly known as the hairy bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features wiry, ascending stems covered in fine, white hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often have a slightly succulent texture. Hoita villosa is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
