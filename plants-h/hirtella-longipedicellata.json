    "intro": "Hirtella longipedicellata, commonly known as the long pedicellate hirtella, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Hirtella longipedicellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
