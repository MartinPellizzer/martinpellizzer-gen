    "intro": "Hieracium pleiocaulon, commonly known as the many-stemmed hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender, often hairy stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped. Its flowers are yellow, with ray florets that are usually shorter than the central disk florets. Hieracium pleiocaulon is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
