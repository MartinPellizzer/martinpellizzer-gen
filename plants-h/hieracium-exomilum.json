It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. It produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Hieracium exomilum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
