    "intro": "Hermannia pallens var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth hermannia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, though the variety glabrescens is noted for its smoother, hairless foliage. Its small, white or pinkish flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, making it an attractive addition to shaded gardens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth."
