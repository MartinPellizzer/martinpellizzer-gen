    "intro": "Hieracium kabanovii, commonly known as Kabanov's hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow, often appearing in dense clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
