    "intro": "Heracleum aureum, commonly known as the golden hogweed, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a robust, hollow stem that is often reddish-purple in color and covered with fine hairs. The plant produces large, umbrella-like clusters of small white or yellowish flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are large, deeply lobed, and have a distinctive silvery-white underside. The plant is known for its strong, unpleasant odor and is considered invasive in some regions."
