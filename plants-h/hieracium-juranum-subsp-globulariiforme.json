    "intro": "Hieracium juranum subsp. globulariiforme, commonly known as the globulariform hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit and distinctive yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered with fine hairs, while its flowers are arranged in a compact head. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and often protected species in its native range."
