    "intro": "Huperzia \u00d7 josephbeitelii, commonly known as the hybrid rock huperzia, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Huperzia selago and Huperzia lucidula. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and dense, glossy green foliage. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, typical of the Huperziaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
