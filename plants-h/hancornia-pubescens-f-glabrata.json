    "intro": "Hancornia pubescens f. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth hancornia, is a variant of the hancornia species native to South America. This plant is a flowering shrub characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark, which distinguishes it from the typical pubescent form. It produces vibrant orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The leaves are typically elliptical and have a glossy surface, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight."
