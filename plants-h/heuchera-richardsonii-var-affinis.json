It features dark green, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and a striking red or purple underside. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, erect stalks. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its foliage and early blooming habit, which adds visual interest during the spring season."
