    "intro": "Hydrocotyle yabei var. japonica, commonly known as Japanese marsh pennywort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in shallow water and moist soils, making it a common sight in wetlands and ponds. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via rhizomes make it both a useful aquatic plant and a potential invasive species in non-native regions."
