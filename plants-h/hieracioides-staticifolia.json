    "intro": "Hieracioides staticifolia, commonly known as the sticky willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems that grow close to the ground, and its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is known for its sticky secretions, which give it its common name and help deter herbivores. It typically thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of wetland flora."
