    "intro": "Hysterobaeckea petraea, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It is a small shrub that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Hysterobaeckea petraea is well adapted to harsh conditions and is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value."
