    "intro": "Honorius demirizianus, commonly known as the Demirizian's honor plant, is a rare species native to the mountainous regions of Southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers during late spring, which are followed by small, oval-shaped fruits. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a cool, moist environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
