    "intro": "Huperzia tetragona, commonly known as the four-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its simple, linear leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Huperzia tetragona is a cryptogamic plant, meaning it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Its structure includes a short, unbranched rhizome with sporangia located on the underside of the leaves."
