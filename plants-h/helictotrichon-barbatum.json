    "intro": "Helictotrichon barbatum, commonly known as the hairy bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and hairy texture, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as prairies and meadows. It has a clump-forming habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Helictotrichon barbatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native landscapes."
