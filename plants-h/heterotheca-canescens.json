    "intro": "Heterotheca canescens, commonly known as silverleaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and yellow daisy-like flowers, which bloom from summer to early fall. The plant is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It has a hairy stem and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Heterotheca canescens is often used in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
