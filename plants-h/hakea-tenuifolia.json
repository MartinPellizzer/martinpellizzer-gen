    "intro": "Hakea tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are densely packed along its stems. The plant produces cylindrical, woody cones that contain the showy, red or orange flowers. These flowers are typically borne in clusters and are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly honeyeaters. Hakea tenuifolia is well-suited to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas."
