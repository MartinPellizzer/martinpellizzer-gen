    "intro": "Helianthemum virgatum f. setosum, commonly known as the hairy rock rose, is a succulent shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, fleshy leaves covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
