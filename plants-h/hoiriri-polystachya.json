It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, compound fronds. The plant typically grows in wet, shady environments such as forest understories. Its fronds are bioluminescent, a unique feature that helps it attract nocturnal pollinators. Hoiriri polystachya plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability."
