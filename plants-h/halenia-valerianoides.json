    "intro": "Halenia valerianoides, commonly known as the lesser valerian, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white or greenish-white flowers. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant has a strong, often disagreeable odor, similar to that of valerian, which is due to the presence of volatile compounds. It is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
