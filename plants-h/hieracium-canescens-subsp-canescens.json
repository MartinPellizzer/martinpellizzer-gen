    "intro": "Hieracium canescens subsp. canescens, commonly known as the hoary hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows. It has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in some regions. Its botanical features include lance-shaped leaves and a composite flower head composed of numerous small florets."
