    "intro": "Himantoglossum affine subsp. samariense, commonly known as the Samarian twayblade, is a rare orchid species native to the Balkan region. It is a herbaceous plant with a slender, upright stem and two opposite leaves. The plant produces a single, slender flower spike bearing a single, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and forest edges. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
