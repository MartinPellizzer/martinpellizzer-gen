It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong winds. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils along shorelines, thriving in well-drained environments. Its growth habit is low and spreading, forming dense mats that help stabilize coastal soils. Hypericum iwate-littorale is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in coastal ecosystems."
