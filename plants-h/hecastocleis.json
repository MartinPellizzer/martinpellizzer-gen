    "intro": "Hecastocleis, commonly known as the \"spider orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to various regions in South Africa, where they thrive in rocky and sandy soils. Hecastocleis species are characterized by their unique, spider-like appearance, with long, slender sepals and petals that resemble legs. They typically bloom in late summer to early autumn, producing clusters of small, fragrant flowers. Due to their specific habitat requirements, many species of Hecastocleis are considered rare or endangered."
