It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture, and its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium tenuicaule is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
