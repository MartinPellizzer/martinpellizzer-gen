    "intro": "Hyphaene multiformis subsp. manca, commonly known as the manca palm, is a species native to the coastal regions of East Africa. It is a robust, fan-shaped palm characterized by its large, segmented leaves and stout, clustered stems. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems. Its fruit produces a hard, fibrous seed that is dispersed by wind and water. The manca palm is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local communities."
