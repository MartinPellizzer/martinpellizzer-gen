It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered with a fine layer of silvery hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountain forests, and prefers well-drained soil. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries that are edible for some bird species. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in shaded garden settings."
