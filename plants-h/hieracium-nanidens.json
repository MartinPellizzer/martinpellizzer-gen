    "intro": "Hieracium nanidens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Hieracium nanidens is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
