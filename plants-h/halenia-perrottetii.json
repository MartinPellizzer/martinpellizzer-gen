    "intro": "Halenia perrottetii, commonly known as the perrottetii halena, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, with a distinct reddish hue on the underside. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Halenia perrottetii is considered a species of conservation concern."
