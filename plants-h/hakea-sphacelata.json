    "intro": "Hakea sphacelata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces striking, bottle-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its root system is adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Hakea sphacelata is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and resilience."
