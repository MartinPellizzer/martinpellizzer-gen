It is characterized by its rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and yellow daisy-like flowers that bloom in summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It has a creeping growth habit and can form dense mats, sometimes becoming invasive in certain regions."
