    "intro": "Halosciastrum, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in shades of yellow, orange, and red. They have thick, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to conserve water, making them well-suited for harsh desert environments. Halosciastrum species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
