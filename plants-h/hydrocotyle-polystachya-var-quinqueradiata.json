    "intro": "Hydrocotyle polystachya var. quinqueradiata, commonly known as the five-rayed water shield, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments in North America. It features broad, floating leaves that are typically divided into five distinct lobes, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, often emerging from the water surface. It thrives in shallow water, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. Its buoyant leaves and rapid growth make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
