    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 rubicundum, commonly known as the red stem hawkweed, is a hybrid plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its reddish stems and yellow composite flowers, which are typical of the genus Hieracium. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. It is a perennial herb that can form dense colonies, often outcompeting native vegetation in certain areas. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
