    "intro": "Hieracium furcellum, commonly known as the mouse-ear hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its leaves are hairy and heart-shaped, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Hieracium furcellum is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
