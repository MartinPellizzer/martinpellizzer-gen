    "intro": "Humulus lupulus var. silvestris, commonly known as wild hops, is a variant of the hop plant native to North America. It is characterized by its vigorous climbing habit and the production of cone-like structures called strobiles, which contain the aromatic and bitter compounds used in brewing. The plant thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and the female plants produce the valuable hop cones. This wild variety is less commonly cultivated than its domesticated counterparts but holds ecological and historical significance."
