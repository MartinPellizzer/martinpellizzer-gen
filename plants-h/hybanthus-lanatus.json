    "intro": "Hybanthus lanatus, commonly known as the woolly hybanthus, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in humid, tropical environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, round berries that contain the seeds. Hybanthus lanatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
