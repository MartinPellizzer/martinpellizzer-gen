    "intro": "Hymenophyllum tortuosum var. bustillosii, commonly known as the twisted filmy fern, is a delicate, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, translucent fronds that are often covered in a thin layer of moisture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique, spiral pattern along the undersides of the fronds. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
