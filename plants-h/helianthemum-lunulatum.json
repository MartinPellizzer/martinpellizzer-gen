It features small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow, typically during late spring to early summer. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
