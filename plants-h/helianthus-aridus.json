    "intro": "Helianthus aridus, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc flowers. The plant is adapted to hot, dry environments with its deep root system and hairy leaves that reduce water loss. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Helianthus aridus is also valued for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in xeriscaping."
