    "intro": "Hordeum vulgare var. macrosteron, commonly known as two-row barley, is a cultivated variant of barley characterized by its two-row arrangement of grains on the spike. It is a member of the Poaceae family and is primarily grown for its seeds, which are used in malting and brewing. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a compact inflorescence. Its grains are smaller and more uniform in size compared to six-row barley, making it suitable for specific industrial applications. This variety is well-adapted to temperate climates and requires a moderate amount of water and nutrients for optimal growth."
