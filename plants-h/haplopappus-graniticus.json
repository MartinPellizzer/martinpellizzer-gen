    "intro": "Haplopappus graniticus, commonly known as the granitic hackberry, is a small shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that are typically green when mature and turn brown as they dry. It is well adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in areas with low water availability. Haplopappus graniticus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
