    "intro": "Hilgeria, commonly known as the coastal hilgeria, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of North America. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along coastal areas, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Hilgeria has small, evergreen leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers in the spring. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
