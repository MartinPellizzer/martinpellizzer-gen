    "intro": "Hymenophyllum orbignianum, commonly known as the orbignian moss, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is a small, delicate epiphytic plant that typically grows on tree trunks and branches in humid, shaded environments. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in length, with a distinctive, glossy appearance. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the leaves and are covered by a protective indusium. Hymenophyllum orbignianum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in high humidity and moderate temperatures."
