    "intro": "Hypericum bracteatum, commonly known as the bracted St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, which are typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its branches. The plant has narrow, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy plant in temperate climates. Hypericum bracteatum is also noted for its medicinal properties, though it is less commonly used than other species in traditional herbal medicine."
