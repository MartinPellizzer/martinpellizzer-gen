It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or tufts. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a smooth texture and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairie and steppe habitats. Helictotrichon planiculme is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in open landscapes."
