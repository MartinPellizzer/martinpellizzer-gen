    "intro": "Helianthemum hyssopifolium var. multiplex, commonly known as the clustered rock rose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically blooming in spring and summer. The plant has compact, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to thrive in dry, rocky environments. It is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal areas due to its drought tolerance and hardiness. The variety 'multiplex' is distinguished by its dense flowering habit, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
