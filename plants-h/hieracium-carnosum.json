    "intro": "Hieracium carnosum, commonly known as the fat hen or cushion hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit, with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against herbivores. Hieracium carnosum is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, such as meadows and waste grounds."
