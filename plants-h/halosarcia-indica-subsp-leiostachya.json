    "intro": "Halosarcia indica subsp. leiostachya, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to saline environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
