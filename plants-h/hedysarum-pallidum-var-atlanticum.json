    "intro": "Hedysarum pallidum var. atlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the coastal regions of the northeastern United States. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and maritime habitats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its trifoliate leaves are compound, with each leaflet being oval-shaped and hairy. Hedysarum pallidum var. atlanticum plays a role in stabilizing dunes and improving soil fertility through nitrogen fixation."
