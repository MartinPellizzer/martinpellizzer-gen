    "intro": "Humularia drepanocephala f. homblei, commonly known as the Hombeli's winged orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, wing-like sepals that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it can receive filtered sunlight. Its flowers are small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from pale pink to white. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
