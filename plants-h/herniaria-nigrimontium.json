    "intro": "Herniaria nigrimontium, commonly known as black mountain cranesbill, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its unique morphology includes a prostrate growth habit and small, rounded leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Herniaria nigrimontium is also notable for its historical use in herbal medicine and as a source of tannins."
