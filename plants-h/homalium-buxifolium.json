It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage. The plant is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
