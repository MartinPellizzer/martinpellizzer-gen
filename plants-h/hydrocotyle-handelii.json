    "intro": "Hydrocotyle handelii, commonly known as the waxy begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or wetlands. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Hydrocotyle handelii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
