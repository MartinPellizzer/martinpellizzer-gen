    "intro": "Hieracium plantagineum subsp. subcrispum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly serrated edge, while the flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster. It is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
