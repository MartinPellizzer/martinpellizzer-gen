    "intro": "Hieracium ursinum, commonly known as wood knapweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and basal leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flower heads that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed soils, often in moist environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
