    "intro": "Hieracium macilentum subsp. macilentiforme, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, yellowish to reddish flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It has finely divided, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its low-growing habit and ability to spread vegetatively, it can form dense mats in suitable environments."
