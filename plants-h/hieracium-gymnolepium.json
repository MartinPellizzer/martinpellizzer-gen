    "intro": "Hieracium gymnolepium, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces yellow flowers with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, and it typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Hieracium gymnolepium has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and can be arranged alternately along the stem. It is often considered a weed due to its ability to spread rapidly in agricultural and natural environments."
