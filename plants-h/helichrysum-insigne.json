    "intro": "Helichrysum insigne, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-orange flowers that are tightly packed into dense, spherical inflorescences. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its foliage is aromatic and often used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory properties. The plant's ability to retain its color when dried makes it popular in floral arrangements."
