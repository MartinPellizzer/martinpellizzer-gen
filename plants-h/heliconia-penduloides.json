    "intro": "Heliconia penduloides, commonly known as the hanging heliconia, is a tropical plant belonging to the Heliconiaceae family. It is characterized by its large, pendulous inflorescences that consist of brightly colored, modified leaves known as bracts. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy texture, which helps in reducing water loss in its native habitat. Heliconia penduloides is native to Central and South America and is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests."
