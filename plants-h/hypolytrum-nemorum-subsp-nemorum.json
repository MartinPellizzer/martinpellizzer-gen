    "intro": "Hypolytrum nemorum subsp. nemorum, commonly known as the bog aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and bog environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in peatlands or along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant features showy, daisy-like flowers with white petals and yellow-orange centers, blooming in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often forming dense clumps, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to waterlogged conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats."
