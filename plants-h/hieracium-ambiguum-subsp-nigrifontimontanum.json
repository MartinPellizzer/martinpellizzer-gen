    "intro": "Hieracium ambiguum subsp. nigrifontimontanum, commonly known as the black-stemmed hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It has hairy, erect stems and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its subspecies name reflects its distinctive dark-colored stems, which set it apart from other hawkweed varieties."
