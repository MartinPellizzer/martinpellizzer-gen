    "intro": "Hypoxis retracta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved star grass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in a star-like pattern, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or open habitats. Hypoxis retracta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
