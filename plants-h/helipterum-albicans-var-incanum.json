    "intro": "Helipterum albicans var. incanum, commonly known as the white sand everlasting, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces fluffy, spherical seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal, aiding in its survival in harsh environments. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This species is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited to drought conditions."
