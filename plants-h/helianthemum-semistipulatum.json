    "intro": "Helianthemum semistipulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features fleshy, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
