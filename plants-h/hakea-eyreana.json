    "intro": "Hakea eyreana, commonly known as the Eyrean hakea, is a shrub native to arid regions of Australia. It features dense, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody stems are often covered in a thick, protective layer of bark. Hakea eyreana is valued for its resilience and is often used in dryland landscaping."
