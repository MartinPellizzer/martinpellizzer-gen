    "intro": "Henriettea rimosa, commonly known as the slender rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important plants such as mustard and cabbage. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. Henriettea rimosa typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on alpine flora and plant adaptation."
