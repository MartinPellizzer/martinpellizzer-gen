    "intro": "Hydrocotyle chamaemorus var. citriodora, commonly known as citron marsh pennywort, is a variant of the marsh pennywort species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich conditions. Its leaves emit a faint citrus scent, which is a distinguishing feature of this variety. This plant plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic organisms."
