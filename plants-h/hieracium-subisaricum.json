    "intro": "Hieracium subisaricum, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosette of leaves, which help it thrive in open, disturbed habitats. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the daisy family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain environments."
