    "intro": "Heliconia deflexa, commonly known as the drooping heliconia, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds. Its inflorescence is often used in floral arrangements due to its vibrant appearance. Heliconia deflexa thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests and coastal areas."
