    "intro": "Harveya pratensis, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it is adapted to cold and harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss. Harveya pratensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
