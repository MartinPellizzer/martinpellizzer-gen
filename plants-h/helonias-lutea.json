    "intro": "Helonias lutea, commonly known as the yellow marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in the eastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows up to 30 centimeters tall and thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
