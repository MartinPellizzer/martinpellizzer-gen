    "intro": "Herniaria annua, commonly known as annual beach herb, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its small, fleshy, green leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is adapted to salty, sandy soils and can tolerate wind and salt spray. Its succulent leaves store water, helping it survive in arid conditions. Herniaria annua is often found in dunes and along the edges of beaches, playing a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
