    "intro": "Hieracium wiesbaurianum subsp. hypotephraeum, commonly known as the Wiesbaur's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow to orange composite flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller flower heads and shorter peduncles compared to other members of the species. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered plant."
