    "intro": "Helianthemum grandiflorum var. obscurum, commonly known as the dark-flowered rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It produces small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a dark center. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and ornamental value in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
