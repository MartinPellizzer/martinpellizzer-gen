    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. lacerosum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and its flowers are yellow with a distinctive central disc. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. The subspecies is characterized by its finely divided leaves and is often found in moist or calcareous soils."
