It features striking, palmately lobed leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from red to purple and green. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red during the summer months. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
