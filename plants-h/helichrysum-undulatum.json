    "intro": "Helichrysum undulatum, commonly known as the golden marguerite or woolly helichrysum, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers that resemble daisies. The plant features fuzzy, silver-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Helichrysum undulatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
