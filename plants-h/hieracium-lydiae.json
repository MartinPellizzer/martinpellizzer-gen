    "intro": "Hieracium lydiae, commonly known as Lydia's Hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces yellow flowers with ray florets that are often mistaken for petals, and its leaves are usually basal, with a rough texture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
