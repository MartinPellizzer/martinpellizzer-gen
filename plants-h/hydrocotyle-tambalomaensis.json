    "intro": "Hydrocotyle tambalomaensis, commonly known as the Trinidadian water shield, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araliaceae. It is native to the island of Trinidad and is typically found in wetland habitats such as marshes and along the edges of freshwater bodies. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged, with a waxy surface that helps it thrive in aquatic environments. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its roots are adapted for absorbing nutrients from the water. Hydrocotyle tambalomaensis plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland habitat by providing shelter and food for various aquatic organisms."
