    "intro": "Hypoxis obtusa var. chrysotricha, commonly known as the golden star lily, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with a central greenish stigma, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense clumps over time."
