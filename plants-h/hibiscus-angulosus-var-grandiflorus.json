    "intro": "Hibiscus angulosus var. grandiflorus, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, and the plant is adapted to survive in hot, dry conditions. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
