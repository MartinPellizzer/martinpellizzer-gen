    "intro": "Hypopitys multiflora var. americana, commonly known as the American clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features dense clusters of scale-like leaves that form a compact, mat-like structure. It produces tiny, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the plant's spores. This variety is closely related to other members of the Lycopodiaceae family and exhibits primitive vascular plant characteristics."
