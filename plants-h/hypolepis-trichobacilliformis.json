    "intro": "Hypolepis trichobacilliformis, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is typically found in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
