    "intro": "Hieracium phaeocomum, commonly known as the purple meadow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers consist of yellow disk florets surrounded by purple ray florets. Hieracium phaeocomum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
