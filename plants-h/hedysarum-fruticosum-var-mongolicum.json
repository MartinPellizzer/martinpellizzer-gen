    "intro": "Hedysarum fruticosum var. mongolicum, commonly known as Mongolian broomrape, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the steppes of Central Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant is notable for its lack of chlorophyll, making it a hemiparasitic species that derives some of its nutrients from host plants. It typically grows in dry, open habitats and is often found in association with grasses and other shrubs. Due to its unique ecological role, it is of interest in studies of plant parasitism and ecosystem dynamics."
