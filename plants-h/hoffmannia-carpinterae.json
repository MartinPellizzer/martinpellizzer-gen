It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
