    "intro": "Heracleum anisactis, commonly known as cow parsnip, is a tall biennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its large, umbrella-like compound leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces a distinctive, aromatic, and sometimes toxic sap that can cause skin irritation. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and forest edges. Its showy flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance."
