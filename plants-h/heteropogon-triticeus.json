    "intro": "Heteropogon triticeus, commonly known as the slender false oat, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Heteropogon triticeus is often found in disturbed soils and can play a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
