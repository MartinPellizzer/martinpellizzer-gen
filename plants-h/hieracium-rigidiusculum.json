    "intro": "Hieracium rigidiusculum, commonly known as rigid hairy hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and basal rosettes of leaves, which are typically covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the daisy family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its hairy foliage and showy flowers, it is both ecologically significant and visually distinctive in its habitat."
