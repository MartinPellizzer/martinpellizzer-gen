    "intro": "Hieracium villosum subsp. villosissimum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and yellow flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows, roadside banks, and wetlands. Its leaves are broadly lance-shaped with prominent veins and a rough, woolly texture. It produces small, yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale yellow ray florets, which bloom from late spring to early autumn."
