    "intro": "Hieracium sylvaticum subsp. semisilvaticum, commonly known as the wood hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows in woodland edges, meadows, and moist soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features basal and stem leaves that are broadly lanceolate with serrated margins. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and it produces small, oval achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. It is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments, showing some tolerance to partial shade."
