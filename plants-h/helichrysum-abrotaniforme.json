    "intro": "Helichrysum abrotaniforme, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its striking yellow to orange flowers that resemble small suns. The plant produces small, papery bracts that persist after the flowers have faded, giving it a long-lasting appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its aromatic foliage and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
