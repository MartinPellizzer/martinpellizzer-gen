    "intro": "Helwingia japonica subsp. liukiuensis, commonly known as the Ryukyu helwingia, is a deciduous shrub native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
