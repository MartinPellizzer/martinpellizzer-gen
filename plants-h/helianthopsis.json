    "intro": "Helianthopsis, commonly known as the sunflower-like plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants typically feature robust, hairy stems and showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer. Helianthopsis species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. They attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies with their vibrant blooms."
