    "intro": "Herniaria ceretanica, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a small, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant has small, round leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its flowers are tiny, white or pale blue, and clustered in dense inflorescences. Herniaria ceretanica is adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in harsh coastal habitats."
