    "intro": "Haworthia spiralis, commonly known as the spiral haworthia, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are pale green with prominent white or grayish markings. The leaves spiral outward, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. It produces small, white flowers on slender stems during the summer months. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or container cultivation due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
