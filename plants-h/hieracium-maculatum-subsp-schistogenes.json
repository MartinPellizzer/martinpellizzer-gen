    "intro": "Hieracium maculatum subsp. schistogenes, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas. The plant features hairy stems and basal leaves that are often lobed or toothed. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, with ray florets that are usually shorter than the disk florets. It is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it an aggressive colonizer in certain environments."
