    "intro": "Hieracium compositum subsp. exanthinum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are broadly lance-shaped with hairy surfaces, and the flowers are yellow with a central disk. It is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
