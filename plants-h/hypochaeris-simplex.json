    "intro": "Hypochaeris simplex, commonly known as the common mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. It has small, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom from spring to summer. Hypochaeris simplex is also known for its ability to spread rapidly through seeds, making it both a weed and a hardy ornamental plant."
