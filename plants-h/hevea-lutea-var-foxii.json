    "intro": "Hevea lutea var. foxii, commonly known as the golden rubber tree, is a variant of the rubber tree species native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its yellowish-green leaves and produces a milky latex sap, similar to its parent species. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its unique coloration makes it a popular ornamental plant in botanical gardens. However, it is less commonly cultivated for commercial rubber production compared to other Hevea species."
