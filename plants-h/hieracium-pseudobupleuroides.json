    "intro": "Hieracium pseudobupleuroides, commonly known as the false bupleurum hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It has hairy stems and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed."
