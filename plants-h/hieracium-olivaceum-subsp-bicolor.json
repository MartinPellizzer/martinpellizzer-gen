It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features basal leaves that are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, with flowering stems that bear yellow flowers in clusters. Its flowers are typically bilaterally symmetrical, with five petals and a central disk of tubular florets. The subspecies is distinguished by its two-toned flowers, which often have a lighter color at the base and a darker hue towards the center."
