    "intro": "Hexorima dichotoma, commonly known as the forked stick plant, is a unique species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive branching pattern, where the stems split into two main branches early in growth. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are small, elliptical, and arranged alternately along the stems. Hexorima dichotoma is adapted to arid conditions, making it a resilient plant in dry environments."
