    "intro": "Hedera rhizomatifera, commonly known as the rhizomatous ivy, is a climbing plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, lobed leaves and its ability to spread via rhizomes, which allow it to form dense mats on rocky surfaces. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Hedera rhizomatifera thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forested areas. Its botanical features make it a hardy and persistent species in its native habitat."
