    "intro": "Hieracium leucotrichum, commonly known as the white-haired hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features basal rosettes of silver-gray, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
