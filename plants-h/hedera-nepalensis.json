    "intro": "Hedera nepalensis, commonly known as the Himalayan ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features dark green, lobed leaves that are often variegated with creamy or yellowish markings. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in temperate forests. Hedera nepalensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to climb trees and walls in its natural habitat."
