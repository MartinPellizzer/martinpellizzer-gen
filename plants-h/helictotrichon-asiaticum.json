It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
