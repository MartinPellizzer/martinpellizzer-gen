    "intro": "Horkelia howellii, commonly known as Howell's horkelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, low-growing habit. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Horkelia howellii is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe."
