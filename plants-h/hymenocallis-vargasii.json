    "intro": "Hymenocallis vargasii, commonly known as the Vargas' spider lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to Mexico. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a distinctive greenish throat. The plant produces a single, slender stem that bears several blooms, which appear in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are strap-like and grass-like, emerging from a bulbous base that stores nutrients. Hymenocallis vargasii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is relatively easy to cultivate in well-drained soil."
