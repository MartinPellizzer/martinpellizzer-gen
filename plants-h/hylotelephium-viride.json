    "intro": "Hylotelephium viride, commonly known as the green stonecrop, is a perennial succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features fleshy, thick leaves that are typically green, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in cold climates, and it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
