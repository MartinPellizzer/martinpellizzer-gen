    "intro": "Helictochloa praetutiana, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in desert or coastal dune environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in harsh, dry climates. Helictochloa praetutiana plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
