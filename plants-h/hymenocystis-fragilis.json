    "intro": "Hymenocystis fragilis, commonly known as the brittle bladder fern, is a delicate, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its small, fragile fronds that often have a bladdery texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures include sori, which are clusters of spores found on the underside of the fronds. Hymenocystis fragilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
