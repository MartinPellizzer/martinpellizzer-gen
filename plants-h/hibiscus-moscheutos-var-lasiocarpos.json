    "intro": "Hibiscus moscheutos var. lasiocarpos, commonly known as the swamp hibiscus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in the southeastern United States. It features showy, large, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils. This variety is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, which set it apart from other hibiscus species."
