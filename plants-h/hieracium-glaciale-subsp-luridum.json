    "intro": "Hieracium glaciale subsp. luridum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually basal, with a rough texture and a distinctive blue-green color. The flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, contributing to the plant's role in pollinator support in high-altitude ecosystems."
