It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, silver-blue blades that give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in panicles, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and open woodlands. Hyparrhenia nyassae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
