    "intro": "Habenaria media, commonly known as the common spider orchid, is a species of orchid native to various regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, or purple. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in seasonal or semi-arid environments. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in rocky or sandy soils. The orchid's pollination is often facilitated by specific insect species, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitats."
