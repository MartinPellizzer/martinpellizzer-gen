    "intro": "Habenaria longicauda subsp. ecalcarata, commonly known as the long-tailed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with a short, stout rhizome and produces a single, slender stem that bears a cluster of lanceolate leaves. The plant is characterized by its elongated, pendulous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with red or purple markings. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The subspecies ecalcarata is distinguished by its more elongated floral bracts and slightly different leaf morphology compared to other members of the species."
