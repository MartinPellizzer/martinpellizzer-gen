    "intro": "Helianthemum guttatum proles littorale, commonly known as the coastal dwarf sunflower, is a low-growing shrub native to coastal regions of Europe. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent leaves that are covered in a waxy coating, helping it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and rocky coastlines. Its compact growth habit and salt tolerance make it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems."
