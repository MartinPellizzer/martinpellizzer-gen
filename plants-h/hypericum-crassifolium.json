    "intro": "Hypericum crassifolium, commonly known as rough-stemmed St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the eastern United States. It features woody stems covered in rough, glandular hairs and lance-shaped leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its leaves and stems contain bioactive compounds, including hypericin and pseudohypericin, which have been studied for their potential medicinal properties. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments."
