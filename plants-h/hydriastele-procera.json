    "intro": "Hydriastele procera, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a unique aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, frond-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length, making it one of the largest ferns in the world. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in swampy areas or along the edges of lakes. Its reproductive structures are specialized, with sporangia clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Hydriastele procera plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
