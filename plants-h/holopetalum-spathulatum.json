    "intro": "Holopetalum spathulatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Asia. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, with a distinctive spatulate (spoon-shaped) petal structure. The plant has a basal rosette of leaves that are broad and lanceolate, providing a striking contrast to its floral display. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to both ornamental gardens and ecological restoration projects."
