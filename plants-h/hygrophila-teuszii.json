    "intro": "Hygrophila teuszii, commonly known as the water hygrophila, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a semi-aquatic species that thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, branching stems that are typically submerged or partially submerged in water. Its small, bright green leaves are arranged oppositely along the stems, and it produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers. Hygrophila teuszii is valued in aquatic gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to improve water quality."
