    "intro": "Hieracium leucomallum, commonly known as the white-haired hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green stems and basal rosettes of leaves. The plant produces numerous yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to Europe, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it a common sight in temperate regions, though it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
