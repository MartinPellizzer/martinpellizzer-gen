    "intro": "Hieracium subfarinaceum, commonly known as the farinaceous hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are generally hairy and lobed, while its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Hieracium subfarinaceum is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
