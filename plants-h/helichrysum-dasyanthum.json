    "intro": "Helichrysum dasyanthum, commonly known as the woolly everlasting, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and bright yellow to orange flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant. Its name comes from the Greek words \"helios\" meaning sun and \"chryos\" meaning gold, reflecting its sunny appearance."
