    "intro": "Hovenkampia, commonly known as the sandverbena, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. The plants are typically low-growing shrubs with small, often hairy leaves and showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Hovenkampia species are adapted to dry conditions, with deep root systems and reduced leaf surfaces to minimize water loss. They play an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity."
