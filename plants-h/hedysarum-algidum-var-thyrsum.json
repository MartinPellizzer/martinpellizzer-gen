    "intro": "Hedysarum algidum var. thyrsum, commonly known as the alpine sweetclover, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. It has a deep taproot system that allows it to survive in harsh, cold environments. This variety is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a forage plant for livestock."
