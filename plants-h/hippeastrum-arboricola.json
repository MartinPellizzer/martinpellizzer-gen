    "intro": "Hippeastrum arboricola, commonly known as the tree amaryllis, is a striking plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, woody stems that can reach heights of up to 10 feet, making it a dramatic addition to gardens or indoor spaces. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of red, white, and pink, often blooming in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, emerging from the base of the plant and contributing to its lush appearance. Hippeastrum arboricola is relatively easy to care for, requiring well-draining soil and moderate watering to thrive."
