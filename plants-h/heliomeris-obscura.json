    "intro": "Heliomeris obscura, commonly known as the ghostflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its unique, tubular flowers that open only during the day. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with small, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically pale pink or white, and they emit a faint, sweet scent to attract pollinators. Heliomeris obscura is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in sandy soils, where it thrives in full sun."
