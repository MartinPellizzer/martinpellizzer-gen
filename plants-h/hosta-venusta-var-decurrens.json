    "intro": "Hosta venusta var. decurrens, commonly known as the spreading white hosta, is a striking perennial plant native to East Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white and green, creating a visually appealing foliage. The plant produces fragrant, lantern-shaped flowers in late summer, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense clumps over time, providing both texture and color in shaded landscapes."
