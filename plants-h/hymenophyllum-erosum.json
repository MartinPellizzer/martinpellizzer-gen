    "intro": "Hymenophyllum erosum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its soft, velvety fronds covered with dense, hair-like trichomes, which give it a unique texture. The plant belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is native to regions of Australia, New Zealand, and parts of Southeast Asia. Its fronds are typically lance-shaped and have a delicate, lace-like appearance. Hymenophyllum erosum is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks, where it absorbs moisture from the air."
