    "intro": "Haplophyllum obtusifolium var. ramosissimum, commonly known as the hairy leaved holly, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, branching growth habit and its evergreen foliage, which consists of thick, waxy leaves with a leathery texture. The leaves are typically oval to elliptic in shape, with a blunt or rounded tip, and are covered in fine, short hairs. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. This plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
