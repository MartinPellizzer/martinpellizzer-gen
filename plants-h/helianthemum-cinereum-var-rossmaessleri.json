    "intro": "Helianthemum cinereum var. rossmaessleri, commonly known as the Rossmaessler's sandthrift, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, adding a bright touch to rocky or sandy soils. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
