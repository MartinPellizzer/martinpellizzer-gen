    "intro": "Hypochaeris sardoa, commonly known as the Sardinian hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sardinia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, while its flowers are yellow with a distinctive central disc. Hypochaeris sardoa is often considered a weed but can serve as a source of nectar for pollinators."
