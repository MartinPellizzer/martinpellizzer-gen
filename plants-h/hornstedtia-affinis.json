    "intro": "Hornstedtia affinis, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a rare and fascinating orchid species native to the high altitudes of South America. It is characterized by its unique, horn-like structures on its flower stems, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hornstedtia affinis is considered a vulnerable species."
