    "intro": "Hygrophila tenera, commonly known as the slender water hyssop, is a semi-aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It typically grows in shallow waters, wetlands, and along the edges of streams and ponds. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, pink or purple flowers arranged in spikes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in water gardens. Hygrophila tenera plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
