    "intro": "Hopea decandra, commonly known as the Malayan ironwood, is a large evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its dense, heavy timber that is highly valued for its durability and strength. The tree can grow up to 50 meters tall, with a straight trunk and broad, elliptical leaves that are glossy green on top and pale underneath. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, three-lobed fruits containing one or two seeds. Hopea decandra plays an important ecological role in tropical rainforests and is also used in traditional medicine."
