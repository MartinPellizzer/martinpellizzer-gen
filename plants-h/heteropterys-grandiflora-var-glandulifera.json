    "intro": "Heteropterys grandiflora var. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular-leafed heteropterys, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are often covered in glandular hairs, giving them a sticky texture. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruits are small, woody capsules that contain several seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in warm climates for its attractive foliage and floral display."
