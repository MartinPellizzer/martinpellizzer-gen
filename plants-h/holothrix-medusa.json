    "intro": "Holothrix medusa, commonly known as the sea apple, is a type of marine invertebrate belonging to the family Holothuriidae. It is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body and vibrant, colorful skin that often displays intricate patterns. This species is found in tropical and subtropical waters, typically inhabiting coral reefs and rocky substrates. The plant-like structure of Holothrix medusa is actually a result of its unique anatomical features, including a central oral siphon and a network of tube feet. It plays a vital role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for smaller organisms."
