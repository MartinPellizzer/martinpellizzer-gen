    "intro": "Hieracium psammogenes subsp. subcaesiifloriforme, commonly known as the sand dune hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes and dry habitats. Its leaves are usually linear and covered with fine hairs, while the inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, yellow disc florets. This subspecies is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystem."
