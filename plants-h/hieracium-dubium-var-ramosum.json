    "intro": "Hieracium dubium var. ramosum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges. It has hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name, and its flowers are often surrounded by bracts. This variant is distinguished by its more branched growth pattern compared to other forms of Hieracium dubium."
