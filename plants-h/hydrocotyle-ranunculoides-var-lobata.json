    "intro": "Hydrocotyle ranunculoides var. lobata, commonly known as the broadleaf marsh mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a rosette of heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are often submerged or partially emergent in shallow water. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in muddy or aquatic soils. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
