    "intro": "Huperzia crassa, commonly known as the broad-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its robust, evergreen rhizomes and its distinctive, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, rounded tubercles. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, round clusters on the underside of the leaves. Huperzia crassa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and its ability to form dense, low-growing mats in suitable habitats."
