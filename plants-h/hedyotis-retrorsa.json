    "intro": "Hedyotis retrorsa, commonly known as the backward hedyotis, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Indian subcontinent. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its flowers are typically arranged in racemose inflorescences, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Hedyotis retrorsa is valued in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
