It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, with a tart flavor. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Humboltia lanceana plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife."
