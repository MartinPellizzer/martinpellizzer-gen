    "intro": "Haworthia cymbiformis f. planifolia, commonly known as the flat-leaf haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, pale green leaves that are flat and broad, distinguishing it from other haworthia species. The leaves are covered in a layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and ease of care, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
