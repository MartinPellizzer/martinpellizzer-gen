It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has small, hairy leaves and produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native habitat."
