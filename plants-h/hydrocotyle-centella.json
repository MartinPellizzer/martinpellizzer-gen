    "intro": "Hydrocotyle centella, commonly known as gotu kola, is a creeping perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily and form dense mats. Hydrocotyle centella is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional medicine."
