    "intro": "Hippocratea bequaertii, commonly known as the Bequaert's hippocratea, is a rare and striking member of the Malvaceae family. Native to the mountainous regions of Ecuador, it is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in cloud forests. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the flowers are borne on long, slender pedicels. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
