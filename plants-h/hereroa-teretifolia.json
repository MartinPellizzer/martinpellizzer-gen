    "intro": "Hereroa teretifolia, commonly known as the African rock fig, is a small, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, rounded foliage and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces edible fig-like fruits that are often consumed by both humans and animals. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to arid environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for garden use in suitable climates."
