    "intro": "Hydrocotyle verticillata var. racemosa, commonly known as the racemose water pennywort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features floating leaves that are palmately divided, with each leaflet being oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in a raceme, which is a type of inflorescence where flowers are borne on a single, elongated stem. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for aquatic ecosystems and a subject of study in phytogeography."
