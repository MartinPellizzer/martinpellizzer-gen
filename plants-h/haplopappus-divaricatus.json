    "intro": "Haplopappus divaricatus, commonly known as the slender pappus plant, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairies and disturbed areas. Its small, yellow flowers are followed by a fluffy pappus, which aids in seed dispersal. Haplopappus divaricatus is a perennial herb that is relatively low-growing and often overlooked in natural landscapes."
