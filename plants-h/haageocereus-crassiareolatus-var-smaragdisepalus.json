It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are often covered in white or pale green spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short, erect pedicels. Its varietal name, *smaragdisepalus*, refers to its striking green sepals that resemble emeralds. This species is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water to thrive."
