    "intro": "Heliconia stella-maris, commonly known as the Star of the Sea Heliconia, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, spiraling inflorescence that resembles a star, hence its common name. The plant produces vibrant orange-red bracts that enclose its small, clustered flowers. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Heliconia stella-maris is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a decorative plant in tropical landscapes."
