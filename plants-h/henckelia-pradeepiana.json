    "intro": "Henckelia pradeepiana, commonly known as the Pradeep's henckelia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Sri Lanka. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a smooth surface, and the flowers are pale pink to white, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
