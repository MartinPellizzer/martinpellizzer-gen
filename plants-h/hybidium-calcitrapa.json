It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in crevices and on rocky outcrops, adapting to harsh, dry conditions. Its leaves are usually alternate and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Hybidium calcitrapa is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it a resilient species in challenging habitats."
