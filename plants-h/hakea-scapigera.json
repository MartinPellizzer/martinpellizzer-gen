    "intro": "Hakea scapigera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces cylindrical, red or yellowish flower spikes that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils make it well adapted to its natural habitat. Hakea scapigera is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
