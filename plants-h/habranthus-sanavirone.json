    "intro": "Habranthus sanavirone, commonly known as the Sanavirone bellflower, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of blue and violet.

Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
