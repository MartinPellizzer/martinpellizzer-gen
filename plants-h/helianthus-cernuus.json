    "intro": "Helianthus cernuus, commonly known as the swamp sunflower, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the eastern United States. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow, daisy-like flowers with a prominent central disk. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with flowering occurring from late spring to early autumn. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils. Helianthus cernuus is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds."
