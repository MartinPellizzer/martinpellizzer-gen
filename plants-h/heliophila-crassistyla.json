It belongs to the family Hydrophyllaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, often blue or purple flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged oppositely along the stem, while its flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences.
