    "intro": "Hydrangea macrophylla f. rosea, commonly known as the pink hydrangea, is a popular ornamental shrub prized for its large, showy flower clusters. The plant is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers, which range from pale pink to deep rose, are composed of sterile flowers (pistillate) and fertile flowers (staminate). The color of the blooms can vary depending on soil pH, with more acidic soils producing deeper pink shades. This variety thrives in partial shade and requires consistent moisture for optimal growth and flowering."
