It features rosettes of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically pale green with a waxy coating. The leaves are often tinged with red or pink at the base, especially when exposed to bright light. It produces small, white or pale green flowers on slender stems during the summer months. This variety is prized for its compact size and attractive, low-maintenance appearance in both indoor and outdoor settings."
