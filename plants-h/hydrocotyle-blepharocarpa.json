    "intro": "Hydrocotyle blepharocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water pennywort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of ponds. The plant has finely divided, almost fern-like leaves that float on the water surface or lie just beneath it. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and are often borne on short stalks. Hydrocotyle blepharocarpa is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters and can serve as a habitat for various aquatic organisms."
