It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. The plant features a tall, slender stem with broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Its flowers are small and clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. Hypolaena elongata is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and unique floral structure."
