It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Hedysarum tongolense is adapted to cold and arid environments, often growing in rocky or alpine soils. Its root system is capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
