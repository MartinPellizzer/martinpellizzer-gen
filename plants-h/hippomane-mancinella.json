    "intro": "Hippomane mancinella, commonly known as the manchineel tree, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, yellowish-green leaves. The tree produces a highly toxic fruit that can cause severe skin irritation and blistering upon contact. Its latex sap is also extremely poisonous and can lead to serious health issues if ingested or applied to the skin. Despite its dangers, the manchineel tree plays a role in local ecosystems and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
