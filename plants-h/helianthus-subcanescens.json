    "intro": "Helianthus subcanescens, commonly known as the plains sunflower, is a species of flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and large, showy yellow flower heads that resemble those of other sunflowers. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, hairy textures, which help reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in the summer and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects."
