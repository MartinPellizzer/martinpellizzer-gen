    "intro": "Hypochaeris cryptocephala, commonly known as the small-headed sow thistle, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of western Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. It typically grows in disturbed soils and open areas, such as roadsides and fields. Hypochaeris cryptocephala is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds."
