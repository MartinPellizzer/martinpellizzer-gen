    "intro": "Heteropterys tomentosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or woolly huito, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps it retain moisture in humid environments. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers that are often followed by bright red or orange berries. Its leaves are typically ovate or elliptical with a leathery texture, and they are covered in fine, soft hairs. Heteropterys tomentosa is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and is valued for its ornamental qualities and traditional uses."
