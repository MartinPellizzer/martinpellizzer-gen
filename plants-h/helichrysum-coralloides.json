The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Helichrysum coralloides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
