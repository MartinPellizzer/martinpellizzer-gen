    "intro": "Haemadictyon membranaceum, commonly known as the lace fern, is a delicate and ornamental plant belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
