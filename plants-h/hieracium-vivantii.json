    "intro": "Hieracium vivantii, commonly known as the living dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant produces yellow ray florets surrounded by a dense array of disk florets, which develop into seeds with fluffy pappi for wind dispersal. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are upright and often hairy. Hieracium vivantii is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in sunny to partially shaded environments."
