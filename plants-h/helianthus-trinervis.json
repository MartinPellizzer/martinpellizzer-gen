    "intro": "Helianthus trinervis, commonly known as the narrow-veined sunflower, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its tall, upright stem and large, yellow composite flower heads that resemble the sunflower genus. Its leaves are narrow and have three distinct veins, giving it its scientific name. Helianthus trinervis is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
