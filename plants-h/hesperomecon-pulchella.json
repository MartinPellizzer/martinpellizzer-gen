    "intro": "Hesperomecon pulchella, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to reddish-purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. Hesperomecon pulchella plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including butterflies and bees, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
