    "intro": "Hakea digyna, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces striking spikes of bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its woody structure and adaptability to dry conditions make it a resilient species in its native habitat. Hakea digyna is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
