    "intro": "Hieracium monopsides, commonly known as the single-seeded hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and ragworts. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a single, showy flower head composed of ray florets. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
