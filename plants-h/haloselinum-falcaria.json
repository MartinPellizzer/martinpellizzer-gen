    "intro": "Haloselinum falcaria, commonly known as the silverleaf saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
