    "intro": "Hydnophytum formicarum var. lucidum, commonly known as the ant plant, is a tropical epiphytic species belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring hollow stems that serve as shelters for ants. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with ants, providing them with shelter in exchange for protection against herbivores and assistance in seed dispersal. Its leaves are typically glossy and elongated, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. This species is native to Southeast Asia and is often found growing on tree trunks in humid, shaded environments."
