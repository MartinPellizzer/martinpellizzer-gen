    "intro": "Hydrolea zeylanica, commonly known as the Indian nettle or Ceylon nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Urticaceae family and is characterized by its stinging hairs that cause a prickling sensation upon contact. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges and emit a mild, aromatic scent. Hydrolea zeylanica is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
