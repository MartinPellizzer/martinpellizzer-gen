It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a hairy texture, while its flowers are yellow and occur in dense clusters. It is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
