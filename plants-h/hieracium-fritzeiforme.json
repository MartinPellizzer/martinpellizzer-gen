It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is native to Europe and is often found in meadows and grassy areas. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
