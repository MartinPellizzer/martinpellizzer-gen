    "intro": "Hedlundia armeniaca, commonly known as Armenian bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Hedlundia armeniaca thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens or alpine beds. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
