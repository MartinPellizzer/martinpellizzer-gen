    "intro": "Hedyotis callitrichoides, commonly known as the common bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, opposite leaves that are often hairy and have a slightly succulent texture. The plant produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its root system is fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Hedyotis callitrichoides is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
