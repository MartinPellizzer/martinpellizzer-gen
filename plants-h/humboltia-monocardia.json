    "intro": "Humboltia monocardia, commonly known as the yellow bell, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange tubular flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 feet, with thick, leathery leaves that are arranged in opposite pairs. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Humboltia monocardia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
