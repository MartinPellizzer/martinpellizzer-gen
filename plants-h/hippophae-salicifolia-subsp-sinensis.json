    "intro": "Hippophae salicifolia subsp. sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese sandthorn, is a shrub native to China and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and small, yellowish-green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces clusters of small, orange-yellow berries that are rich in vitamin C and other nutrients. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is used in both ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
