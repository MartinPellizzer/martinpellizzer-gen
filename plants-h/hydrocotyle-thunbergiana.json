    "intro": "Hydrocotyle thunbergiana, commonly known as silverleaf groundsel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It features a rosette of shiny, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its foliage is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its primary ecological role is as a ground cover in its native habitats."
