    "intro": "Harpalyce cubensis var. cajalbanensis, commonly known as the Cuban harpalyce, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and parts of the Greater Antilles. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as savannas and rocky soils. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
