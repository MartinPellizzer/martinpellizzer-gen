    "intro": "Hedypnois arenaria var. pinnatifolia, commonly known as the sand fennel, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
