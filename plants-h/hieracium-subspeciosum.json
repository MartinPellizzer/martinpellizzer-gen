    "intro": "Hieracium subspeciosum, commonly known as the showy hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its bright yellow flowers, which bloom in summer, are surrounded by pale green ray florets, making it visually striking. Hieracium subspeciosum is often found in open habitats and can spread rapidly through rhizomes, making it both a common wildflower and a potential weed."
