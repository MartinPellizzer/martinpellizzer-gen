It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, silver-green leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the grass family. Hyparrhenia bagirmica is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, thriving in well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
