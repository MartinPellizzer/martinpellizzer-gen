    "intro": "Helictochloa marginata var. font-queriana, commonly known as the Font-Quer's silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray blades with fine, hairy margins, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and dry grasslands. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, followed by narrow, spike-like seed heads. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its graceful, airy foliage."
