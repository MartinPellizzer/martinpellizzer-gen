    "intro": "Humboltia prolifera, commonly known as the Pacific sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant features showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Humboltia prolifera plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
