    "intro": "Herminium angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. Native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Its morphology reflects adaptations to low-light conditions and nutrient-poor soils."
