    "intro": "Hakea versicolor, commonly known as the variable hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, often colorful, cylindrical or club-shaped flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces woody, spine-tipped fruits that contain seeds dispersed by birds. Hakea versicolor is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient and drought-tolerant species."
