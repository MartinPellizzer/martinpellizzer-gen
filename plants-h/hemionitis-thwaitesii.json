    "intro": "Hemionitis thwaitesii, commonly known as the mountain spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the high altitudes of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense, compact rosettes of dark green, leathery leaves. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing both spores and vegetative propagules, which allows it to thrive in harsh conditions. Its leaves are deeply divided, with a distinctive, fan-like shape that aids in water retention. Hemionitis thwaitesii is often found in crevices or on cliffs, where it can access moisture from morning dew and mist."
