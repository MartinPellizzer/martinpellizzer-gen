    "intro": "Haumaniastrum coriaceum subsp. attenuifolium, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, leathery, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers in its harsh environment. This subspecies is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
