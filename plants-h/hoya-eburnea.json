    "intro": "Hoya eburnea, commonly known as the White-veined Waffleplant, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its waxy, oval-shaped leaves that are often marked with white veins, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the summer months. Hoya eburnea thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
