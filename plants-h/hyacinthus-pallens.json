    "intro": "Hyacinthus pallens, commonly known as the white hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. The plant belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that emerge from the base of the bulb. Hyacinthus pallens thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and floral arrangements. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early spring blooming habit."
