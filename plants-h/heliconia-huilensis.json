    "intro": "Heliconia huilensis, commonly known as the Huil\u00e9n heliconia, is a striking tropical plant native to Colombia. It belongs to the Heliconiaceae family and is characterized by its large, colorful bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces long, drooping inflorescences with numerous small, tubular flowers that are primarily pollinated by birds and insects. Its leaves are broad and often have a waxy texture, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Heliconia huilensis is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
