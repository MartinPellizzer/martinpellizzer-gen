It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow stem with a milky sap that is often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is notable for its height, often reaching up to 2 meters, making it a striking feature in its native habitat."
