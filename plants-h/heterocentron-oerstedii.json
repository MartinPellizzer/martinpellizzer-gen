    "intro": "Heterocentron oerstedii, commonly known as the Oersted's water fern, is a aquatic fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its floating, delicate fronds that are typically divided into small, narrow segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Heterocentron oerstedii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and shelter for small aquatic organisms."
