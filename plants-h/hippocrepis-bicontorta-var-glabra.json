    "intro": "Hippocrepis bicontorta var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth helmet orchid, is a rare and distinctive member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped flowers that are typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly in the mountainous areas of the Iberian Peninsula. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
