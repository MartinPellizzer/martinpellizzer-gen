    "intro": "Hesperaloe nocturna, commonly known as the night lily or desert torch, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features striking, spiky, red or orange flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique nocturnal blooming habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance gardens."
