    "intro": "Hemionitis pedata, commonly known as the waterwheel plant, is a unique aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves that resemble the spokes of a wheel, giving it its common name. The plant has a distinctive floating structure called a \"float\" that helps it remain buoyant on the water's surface. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, with a waxy coating that reduces water loss. Hemionitis pedata is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, where it plays a role in supporting aquatic ecosystems."
