    "intro": "Hieracium pyrenaeoscense, commonly known as the Pyrenean hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the Pyrenees mountain range. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring rocky and well-drained soils. It has small, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces numerous tiny seeds dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
