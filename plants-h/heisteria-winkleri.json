    "intro": "Heisteria winkleri, commonly known as the Winkler's heisteria, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to blue. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of silky hair, which helps reduce water loss. Heisteria winkleri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
