    "intro": "Hedysarum strictifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sweet clover, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, trifoliate leaves with a distinctive narrow shape. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It has a deep root system that helps stabilize soil and fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it valuable in ecological restoration. Hedysarum strictifolium is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats and is adapted to temperate climates."
