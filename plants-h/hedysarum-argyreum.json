    "intro": "Hedysarum argyreum, commonly known as the silverweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in well-drained soils. Hedysarum argyreum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks, where it contributes to biodiversity and soil stabilization."
