    "intro": "Hieracium siskiyouense, commonly known as Siskiyou hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in the Siskiyou Mountains of Oregon and California. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest clearings, often in areas with well-drained soils. It produces yellow to orange flower heads composed of numerous small florets, and its leaves are usually hairy and lance-shaped. Hieracium siskiyouense is a perennial herb that plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
