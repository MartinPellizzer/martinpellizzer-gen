    "intro": "Hydastylus californicus, commonly known as the California hydastis, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of California. It features a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread along the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a slightly hairy texture, while the stems are often prostrate or ascending. Hydastylus californicus is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats."
