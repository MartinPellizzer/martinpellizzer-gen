    "intro": "Hieracium aurosicum, commonly known as the golden hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, preferring partial to full sunlight. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Hieracium aurosicum is often found in temperate climates and can sometimes be considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
