It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its clusters of bright yellow, daisy-like flowers. The plant produces small, papery bracts that give it a feathery appearance, often mistaken for true petals. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
