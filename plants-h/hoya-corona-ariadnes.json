    "intro": "Hoya corona-ariadnes, commonly known as the \"Queen of the Hoya\" or \"Ariadne's Crown,\" is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its waxy, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of star-shaped, waxy white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is known for its slow growth and ability to thrive in low-light conditions, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its flowers emit a faint, sweet fragrance, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Hoya corona-ariadnes is also noted for its ability to produce aerial roots, which help it climb and attach to surfaces."
