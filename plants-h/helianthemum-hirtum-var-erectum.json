    "intro": "Helianthemum hirtum var. erectum, commonly known as the upright stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to southern Europe. It features fleshy, upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers during the summer months, adding a vibrant touch to rocky or sandy habitats. Its leaves are typically thick and rounded, adapted for storing water. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
