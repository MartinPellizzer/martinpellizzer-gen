    "intro": "Hohenbergia catingae var. eximbricata, commonly known as the Catinga Hohenbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It features rosettes of narrow, dark green leaves that are often adorned with white or silver markings. The plant produces vibrant orange-red inflorescences that emerge from the center of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance in suitable growing conditions."
