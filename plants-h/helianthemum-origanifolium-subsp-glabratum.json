    "intro": "Helianthemum origanifolium subsp. glabratum, commonly known as the glabrous rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has aromatic, narrow leaves that are covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. This subspecies is notable for its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate drought conditions."
