It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate blue or violet flowers with prominent white markings. The plant typically blooms in early spring and thrives in moist, acidic soils. It is often found in woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
