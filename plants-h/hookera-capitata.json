    "intro": "Hookera capitata, commonly known as the mountain snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters at the top of its stems. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Hookera capitata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
