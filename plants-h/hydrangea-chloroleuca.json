    "intro": "Hydrangea chloroleuca, commonly known as the white hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that can range from white to pink or blue depending on soil pH. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features serrated, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine white or grayish pubescence. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer and are composed of sterile white bracts surrounded by smaller, fertile flowers. Hydrangea chloroleuca thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
