    "intro": "Hottonia, commonly known as water hottonia or the water bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Primulaceae. It is characterized by its aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit, typically found in wetlands, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually blue or violet in color, with five petals and a prominent, spurred lower petal. Its leaves are typically submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Hottonia species are often used in water gardens and are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
