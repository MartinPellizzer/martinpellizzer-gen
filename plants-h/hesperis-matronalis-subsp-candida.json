It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers. The subspecies candida is distinguished by its pale to white flowers, contrasting with the more vibrant pink or purple of the typical Hesperis matronalis. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
