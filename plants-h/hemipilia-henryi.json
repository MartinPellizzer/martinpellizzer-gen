    "intro": "Hemipilia henryi, commonly known as the Henry's hemipilia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are elliptical and arranged in a basal rosette, while its inflorescence consists of a single spike bearing several small, white or pale pink flowers. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Hemipilia henryi is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
