    "intro": "Hieracium tommasinianum, commonly known as the Italian hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring temperate climates. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
