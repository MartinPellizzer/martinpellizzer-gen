    "intro": "Hyoseris radiata var. lucida, commonly known as the shining sunflower, is a variant of the sunflower species native to parts of Asia and the Americas. It is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers and slender, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in open areas such as meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowering period usually occurs in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
