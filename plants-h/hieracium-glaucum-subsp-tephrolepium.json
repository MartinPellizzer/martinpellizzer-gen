    "intro": "Hieracium glaucum subsp. tephrolepium, commonly known as the pale hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 40 centimeters. The plant features basal leaves that are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, while the stem is usually unbranched and somewhat hairy. Its flowers are yellow, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and are borne on long pedicels. The subspecies is distinguished by its pale greenish-blue leaves and reduced floral structures compared to other Hieracium species."
