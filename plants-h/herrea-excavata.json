    "intro": "Herrea excavata, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its woody stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Herrea excavata is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental beauty in xeriscaping."
