It features dense rosettes of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically green with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to maintain its vibrant appearance. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
