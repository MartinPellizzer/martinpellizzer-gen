    "intro": "Hieracium parvellum, commonly known as the lesser hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium parvellum is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
