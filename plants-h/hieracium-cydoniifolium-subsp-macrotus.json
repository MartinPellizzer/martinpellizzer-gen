    "intro": "Hieracium cydoniifolium subsp. macrotus, commonly known as the large-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its robust growth and large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 15 cm in length. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
