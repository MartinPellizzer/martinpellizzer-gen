    "intro": "Hemionitis cheiloglyphis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed hemionitis, is a rare and specialized fern found in specific habitats. It belongs to the family Hemionitidaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in humid forests. Its reproductive structures are unique, with sporangia clustered in specialized leaf axils. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
