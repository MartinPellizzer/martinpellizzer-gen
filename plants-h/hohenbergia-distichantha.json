    "intro": "Hohenbergia distichantha, commonly known as the silver stripe hohenbergia, is a perennial bromeliad native to Brazil. It features a rosette of narrow, fleshy, silver-green leaves that are often marked with white or pale green stripes. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers on a central stem, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hohenbergia distichantha is prized for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
