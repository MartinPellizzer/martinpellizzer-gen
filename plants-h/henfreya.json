    "intro": "Henfreya, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and features narrow, grass-like leaves. Henfreya thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
