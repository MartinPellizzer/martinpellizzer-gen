    "intro": "Hieracium leptolepium, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has slender, hairy stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense colonies."
