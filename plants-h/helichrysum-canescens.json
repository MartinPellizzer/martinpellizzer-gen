It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its long-lasting flowers are often used in floral arrangements, and it is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine. The plant's resilience and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardens in arid climates."
