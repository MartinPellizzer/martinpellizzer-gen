    "intro": "Hieracium marginelliceps, commonly known as the margin-leaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grasslands. It has hairy stems and leaves with a distinctive margin that is often lobed or toothed. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
