It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. This plant is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and its production of small, bell-shaped flowers that are often brightly colored. Hansteinia gracilis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
