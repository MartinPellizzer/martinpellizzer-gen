    "intro": "Hedeoma breviflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hedeoma, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to New Zealand. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pale blue or purple. Its flowering period occurs during the spring and early summer, and it is often found in the understory of native forests. Hedeoma breviflora is valued for its ecological role in supporting local insect populations and its ornamental appeal in native gardens."
