    "intro": "Hydriastele calcicola, commonly known as the limestone hydriastele, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in calcareous soils. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The species is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding structure, typical of bromeliads. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas."
