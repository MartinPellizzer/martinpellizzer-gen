    "intro": "Humata cicutarioides, commonly known as the slender water clover, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in South America. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that resemble those of the water clover genus, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshy or pond edges. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
