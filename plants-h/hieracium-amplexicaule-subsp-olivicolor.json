    "intro": "Hieracium amplexicaule subsp. olivicolor, commonly known as the olive-green hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow-orange composite flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its olive-green leaf blades and a hairy stem. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
