    "intro": "Hypolytrum nemorum var. minus, commonly known as the lesser wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are often hairy and have a distinctive sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. The species is often confused with other similar-looking sorrel species but can be distinguished by its specific leaf morphology and habitat preferences."
