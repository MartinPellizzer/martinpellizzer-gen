It features dense clusters of small, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a bluish tint. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white during the winter months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
