    "intro": "Hieracium diaphanoides subsp. atriplex, commonly known as the silver hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry meadows, grasslands, and rocky soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its subspecies status reflects subtle differences in morphology compared to other Hieracium species. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas."
