    "intro": "Hemigraphis klossii var. elatior, commonly known as the silver mohair plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features dense, velvety foliage with a striking silver or grayish-white underside, contrasting beautifully with its deep green upper surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in partial to full shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and shaded outdoor landscapes."
