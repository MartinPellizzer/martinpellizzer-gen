    "intro": "Hieracium siniora, commonly known as the lesser hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the dandelion family (Compositae) and is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Hieracium siniora is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
