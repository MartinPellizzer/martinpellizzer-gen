    "intro": "Hieracium glomerellum, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and woodland edges. Its leaves are basal, rough, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in dense clusters. Hieracium glomerellum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
