    "intro": "Hieracium stenopodum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright stems and basal rosette of leaves, which are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native flora."
