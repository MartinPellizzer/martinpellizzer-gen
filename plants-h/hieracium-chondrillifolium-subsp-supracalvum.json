    "intro": "Hieracium chondrillifolium subsp. supracalvum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosettes of lanceolate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
