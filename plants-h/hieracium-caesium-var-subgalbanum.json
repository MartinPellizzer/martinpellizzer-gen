    "intro": "Hieracium caesium var. subgalbanum, commonly known as the lesser hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor environments. This variety is distinguished by its smaller flower heads compared to other hawkweed species."
