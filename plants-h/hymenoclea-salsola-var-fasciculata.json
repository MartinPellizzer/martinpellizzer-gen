    "intro": "Hymenoclea salsola var. fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb with a mat-like growth habit, characterized by its dense clusters of small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and it is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its succulent leaves help it store water, making it well-suited for sandy soils. It is often found in disturbed areas and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
