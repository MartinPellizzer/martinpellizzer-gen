    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. compar, commonly known as the two-lobed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. The plant features basal leaves that are heart-shaped with a distinctive two-lobed base, and its flowers are yellow, consisting of ray florets surrounded by a disk of tubular flowers. It produces small, dry fruits called cypsela, which are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
