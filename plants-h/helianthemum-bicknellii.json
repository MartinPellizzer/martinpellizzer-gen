It features small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring, typically from April to June. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
