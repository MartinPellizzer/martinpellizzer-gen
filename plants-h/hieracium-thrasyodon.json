    "intro": "Hieracium thrasyodon, commonly known as the rough hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosette of leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and disturbed soils. Hieracium thrasyodon is an herbaceous perennial that can spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some areas."
