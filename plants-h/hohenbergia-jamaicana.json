    "intro": "Hohenbergia jamaicana, commonly known as the Jamaican hohenbergia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, water-holding cup. The plant produces striking, pendulous inflorescences with brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hohenbergia jamaicana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
