    "intro": "Helleborine leptochila var. vectensis, commonly known as the slender-leaved helleborine, is a perennial orchid belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive hooded structure. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, this plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is known for its ability to form mycorrhizal associations with fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake. The plant's morphology and habitat preferences make it a notable species in botanical studies of temperate flora."
