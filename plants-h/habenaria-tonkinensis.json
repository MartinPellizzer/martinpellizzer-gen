    "intro": "Habenaria tonkinensis, commonly known as the Tonkin orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its erect, often branched stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
