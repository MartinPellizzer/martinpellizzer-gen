It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in cold climates, with some varieties being winter-hardy in USDA zones 4 and above."
