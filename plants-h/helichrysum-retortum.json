    "intro": "Helichrysum retortum, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its striking yellow-orange flowers that resemble small suns. The plant produces tiny, papery bracts that persist after the flowers have faded, giving it a long-lasting appearance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs. Helichrysum retortum is well adapted to arid environments and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil."
