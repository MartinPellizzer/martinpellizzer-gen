    "intro": "Hymenophyllum ciliatum var. ornifolium, commonly known as the ornate toothed fern, is a delicate epiphytic fern native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds with distinctive ciliate margins that give it its common name. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its intricate foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and conservation efforts."
