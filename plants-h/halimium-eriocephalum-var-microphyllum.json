    "intro": "Halimium eriocephalum var. microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved woolly catchfly, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, ovate leaves covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, preferring coastal or Mediterranean climates."
