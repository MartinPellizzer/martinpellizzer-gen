    "intro": "Hakea acicularis, commonly known as the needle bush, is an evergreen shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are typically bright green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. Hakea acicularis is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for dry gardens. Its unique foliage and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with mild, dry climates."
