    "intro": "Hieracium glaucinum var. basalticum, commonly known as the basalt yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the volcanic regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters at the top of the stem. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils, often found on rocky or barren ground. Its flowering period typically occurs from June to August, and it is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The species is notable for its unique morphological features that help it survive in its specific ecological niche."
