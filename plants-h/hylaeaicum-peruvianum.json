It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves and vibrant yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
