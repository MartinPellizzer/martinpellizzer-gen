It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, dunes, and sandy soils. The plant features slender, grass-like blades with long, spreading leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
