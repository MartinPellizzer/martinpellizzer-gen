    "intro": "Haplopappus schumannii, commonly known as the Schumann's brittleweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, narrow leaves adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with small, scale-like bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. Haplopappus schumannii is often found in disturbed soils and is well-suited to survive in low-nutrient, dry conditions."
