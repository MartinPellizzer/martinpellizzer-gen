    "intro": "Haloragis luminosa, commonly known as the moonflower, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet, coastal environments. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that open at night, emitting a faint fragrance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a fibrous root system. Haloragis luminosa is known for its nocturnal blooming habit, which is an adaptation to its native habitat."
