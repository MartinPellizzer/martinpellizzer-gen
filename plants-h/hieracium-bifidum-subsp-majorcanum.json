    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. majorcanum, commonly known as the Majorcan hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Majorca. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and tall, slender flowering stems. The flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in a single head, and are surrounded by leaf-like bracts. This subspecies is distinguished by its slightly divided leaves and its adaptation to rocky or dry habitats. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its native range."
