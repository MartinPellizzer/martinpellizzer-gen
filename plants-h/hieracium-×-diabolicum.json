It is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy, lobed leaves, which are typical of the genus Hieracium. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and open areas, thriving in temperate climates. Its common name reflects its striking appearance and the way it resembles a dandelion. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
