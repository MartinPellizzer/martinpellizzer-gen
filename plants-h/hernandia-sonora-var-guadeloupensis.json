    "intro": "Hernandia sonora var. guadeloupensis, commonly known as the Guadeloupe hernandia, is a shrub native to the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in inflorescences, which are followed by capsule fruits containing minute seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats, often found in tropical rainforests or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
