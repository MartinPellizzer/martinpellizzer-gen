    "intro": "Habenaria casillasii, commonly known as the Casillas' orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to specific regions in South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, while its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
