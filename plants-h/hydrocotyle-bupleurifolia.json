    "intro": "Hydrocotyle bupleurifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features floating leaves with a waxy surface that help it stay buoyant and reduce water loss. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a distinct white vein pattern, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Hydrocotyle bupleurifolia plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
