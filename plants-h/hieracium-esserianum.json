It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows and grasslands. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help in reducing water loss. It is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its aggressive growth habit."
