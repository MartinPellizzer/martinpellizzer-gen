It is characterized by its smooth, glossy leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth. It has small, elliptical leaves that are often arranged oppositely along the stems. This form is distinguished by its leaf surface texture and is a less common variant within the Hypericum genus."
