    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracesium pallescens, commonly known as the pale hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, dandelion-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
