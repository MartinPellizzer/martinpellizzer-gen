    "intro": "Hieracium tubulascens subsp. pseudosuecicum, commonly known as the Swedish hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow flower heads and basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and woodland edges. It produces small, tubular flowers that attract various pollinators, including bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
