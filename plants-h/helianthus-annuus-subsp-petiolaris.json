    "intro": "Helianthus annuus subsp. petiolaris, commonly known as the slenderleaf sunflower, is a variant of the common sunflower characterized by its elongated, slender leaves and slightly smaller flower heads. It is native to the central and southern United States, where it thrives in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with a branching structure that supports its yellow-orange composite flowers. Its foliage is often more upright and less hairy compared to the standard sunflower, making it distinct in appearance. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its seeds, though it is less commonly used for commercial sunflower oil production."
