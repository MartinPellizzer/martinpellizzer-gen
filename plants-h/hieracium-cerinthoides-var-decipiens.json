    "intro": "Hieracium cerinthoides var. decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features basal rosettes of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native flora in certain regions."
