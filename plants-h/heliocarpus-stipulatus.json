    "intro": "Heliocarpus stipulatus, commonly known as the yellow balsa, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and alternate, ovate leaves with prominent stipules. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits. Its seeds are enclosed in a hard, helmet-shaped capsule, which is a distinctive feature of the genus Heliocarpus. The tree is often found in moist lowland forests and is valued for its lightweight wood."
