    "intro": "Heuchera americana, commonly known as the American alumroot, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, often colorful leaves that vary in hue from green to red, purple, and silver. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red during the spring. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Heuchera americana is valued for its ornamental foliage and its ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
