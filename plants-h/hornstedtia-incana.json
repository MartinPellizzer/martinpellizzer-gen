    "intro": "Hornstedtia incana, commonly known as the stiff hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its erect, wiry stems and dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Its flowering inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, pale green to brownish spikelets. Hornstedtia incana is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates."
