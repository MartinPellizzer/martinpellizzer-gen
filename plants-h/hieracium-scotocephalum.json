It typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features a basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. Its flowers are followed by pale\u8910\u8272, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium scotocephalum is known for its ornamental value but can also be invasive in certain regions."
