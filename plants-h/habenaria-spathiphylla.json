    "intro": "Habenaria spathiphylla, commonly known as the orchid with a spatulate lip, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, showy flower with a distinctive spatulate lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers are often pale green or yellowish, with a highly specialized structure that facilitates pollination by specific insects. The orchid's rhizome is fibrous, and it produces numerous small, white or greenish flowers along the stem."
