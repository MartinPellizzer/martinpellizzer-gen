    "intro": "Haworthia turgida f. pallidifolia, commonly known as the pale leaf Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically pale green to bluish-gray in color, with prominent white to pale yellow markings. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to maintain its vibrant appearance. Due to its compact size and unique foliage, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
