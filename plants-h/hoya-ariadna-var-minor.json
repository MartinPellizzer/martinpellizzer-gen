    "intro": "Hoya ariadna var. minor, commonly known as the miniature prayer plant, is a compact species of the Hoya genus native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, ovate leaves with a waxy texture and subtle variegation, often displaying shades of green, white, and pink. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom in response to adequate light and proper care. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance. This variety thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
