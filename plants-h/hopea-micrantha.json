It is characterized by its dense, dark brown heartwood that is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. Its flowers are small and clustered, with pale yellow petals, and it produces woody, three-lobed fruits. Hopea micrantha is often found in lowland dipterocarp forests and plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
