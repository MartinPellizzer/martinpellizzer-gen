    "intro": "Haplopappus squarrosus subsp. stenolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, white pappus structures that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. This subspecies is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
