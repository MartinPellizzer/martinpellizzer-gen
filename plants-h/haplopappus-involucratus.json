    "intro": "Haplopappus involucratus, commonly known as the slender pappusweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and the plant produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Haplopappus involucratus is often found in arid environments and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils."
