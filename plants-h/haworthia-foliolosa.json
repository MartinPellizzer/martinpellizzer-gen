    "intro": "Haworthia foliolosa, commonly known as the leafy Haworthia, is a small, succulent plant native to South Africa. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or pale markings. The leaves are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements."
