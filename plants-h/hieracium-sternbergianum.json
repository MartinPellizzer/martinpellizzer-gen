    "intro": "Hieracium sternbergianum, commonly known as the Sternberg's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. Native to the northern regions of North America, it thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. The plant has rough, hairy stems and is often found in disturbed soils. It is considered a weed in some areas due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread vegetatively."
