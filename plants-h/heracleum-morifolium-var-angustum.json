    "intro": "Heracleum morifolium var. angustum, commonly known as narrow-leaved cow parsnip, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It features a tall, hollow stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are narrower than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters called umbels, which bloom in the summer months. Its root system consists of a thick, fleshy root that is often harvested for culinary or medicinal purposes. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows and along stream banks."
