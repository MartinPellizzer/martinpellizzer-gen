    "intro": "Hierochloe redolens var. fraseri, commonly known as Fraser's sweetgrass, is a perennial grass native to the wetlands and marshes of North America. It is characterized by its fine, silky leaves that emit a subtle, pleasant fragrance, especially when crushed. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense, low-growing clumps. Its inflorescence consists of slender, spike-like clusters of small, fluffy flowers that appear in late summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional cultural practices."
