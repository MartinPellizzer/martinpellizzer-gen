It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, oval-shaped leaves arranged in whorls. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Haloragis digyna plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and fish."
