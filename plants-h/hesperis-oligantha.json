    "intro": "Hesperis oligantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress plants, and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Hesperis oligantha is often found in disturbed or semi-arid environments, making it an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
