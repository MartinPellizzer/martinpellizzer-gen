    "intro": "Helichrysum saturejifolium, commonly known as the golden everlasting or Cape gold, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that resemble tiny suns. The plant has silver-gray foliage with hairy leaves, which help it retain moisture in its natural arid environment. It produces papery, long-lasting bracts that remain colorful even after the flowers have faded. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
