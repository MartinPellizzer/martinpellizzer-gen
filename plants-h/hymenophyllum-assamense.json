    "intro": "Hymenophyllum assamense, commonly known as the Assam shield fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the northeastern regions of India. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds with a glossy, waxy surface. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a flap-like indusium. This species is valued for its ornamental appearance and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its habitat."
