    "intro": "Hieracium cladophorum, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring well-drained conditions. Its leaves are basal and form a rosette, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss. The flowers are yellow, with ray florets surrounding a central disk, and the plant produces numerous small, persistent seeds."
