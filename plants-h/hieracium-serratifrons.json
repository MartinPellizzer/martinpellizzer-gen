    "intro": "Hieracium serratifrons, commonly known as the serrated hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are deeply lobed and serrated, giving it its common name. The plant produces daisy-like flowers with yellow disk florets surrounded by pale yellow to white ray florets. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows and riverbanks. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
