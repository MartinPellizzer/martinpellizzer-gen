    "intro": "Hieracium melanoadenum, commonly known as the black-stem hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, with dark green, hairy leaves and yellow ray flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it can outcompete native vegetation and is sometimes considered a weed."
