    "intro": "Heliocarpus arborescens, commonly known as the golden apple tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by woody, globular fruits that contain one or two seeds. Its fruit is notable for its hard, woody outer layer, which is characteristic of the Heliocarpus genus. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in some indigenous communities."
