    "intro": "Hypericum callianthum, commonly known as the golden-stemmed St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and woody stems, which are typical features of the Hypericaceae family. The plant produces small, orange-yellow berries that contain seeds, and its leaves are opposite and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Hypericum callianthum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
