    "intro": "Hirculus congestiflorus, commonly known as the clustered hornplant, is a rare flowering species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, waxy flowers that bloom in shades of violet and white. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor in rocky soil, allowing it to thrive in harsh conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
