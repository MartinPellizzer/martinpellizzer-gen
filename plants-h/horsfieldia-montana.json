    "intro": "Horsfieldia montana, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, leafy stems and produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, which is common in its natural habitat. Horsfieldia montana is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique floral structure and resilience."
