    "intro": "Heteropterys apiculata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the rainy season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Heteropterys apiculata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks."
