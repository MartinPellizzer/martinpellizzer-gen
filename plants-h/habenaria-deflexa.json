    "intro": "Habenaria deflexa, commonly known as the flexed orchid, is a species of terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in well-drained, humus-rich soil. The plant produces slender, upright stems that bear several lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, often with a subtle fragrance, and are arranged in a loose raceme. Habenaria deflexa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
