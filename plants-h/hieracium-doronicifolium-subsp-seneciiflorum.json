    "intro": "Hieracium doronicifolium subsp. seneciiflorum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its flowering heads consist of numerous small ray florets surrounded by disc florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is often considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
