    "intro": "Holodiscus argenteus var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine silverweed, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its silver-white, woolly leaves that help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and alpine tundra. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate cold climates."
