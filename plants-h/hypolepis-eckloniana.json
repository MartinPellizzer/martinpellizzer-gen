    "intro": "Hypolepis eckloniana, commonly known as the sword fern, is a tropical fern native to Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves that are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its fronds are bioluminescent in some species, but this trait is not common in Hypolepis eckloniana. The rhizome is creeping and produces new shoots, allowing the plant to spread and form dense colonies."
