    "intro": "Hoya kanyakumariana, commonly known as the Kanyakumari hoya, is a species of flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and dark green, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers with white petals and prominent yellow stamens, typically blooming during the summer months. It is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance requirements and ability to thrive in indirect light. Hoya kanyakumariana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in traditional medicine."
