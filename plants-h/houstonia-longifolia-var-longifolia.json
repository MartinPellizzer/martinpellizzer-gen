    "intro": "Houstonia longifolia var. longifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and pine flatwoods. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, facilitating its spread in suitable habitats."
