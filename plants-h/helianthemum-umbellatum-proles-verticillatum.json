    "intro": "Helianthemum umbellatum proles verticillatum, commonly known as the clustered rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, often in sunny, rocky habitats. The plant has woody stems covered in fine, white hairs, and its leaves are small, oval, and slightly hairy. It is well adapted to dry, Mediterranean climates and is often found in coastal areas and limestone soils. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
