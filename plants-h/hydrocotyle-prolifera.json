    "intro": "Hydrocotyle prolifera, commonly known as the water pennywort, is a small aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wetlands. The plant has a rosette of rounded, waxy leaves that float on the water surface, with smaller leaves submerged beneath. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees. Hydrocotyle prolifera is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative reproduction, making it both a useful aquatic plant and a potential invasive species in certain areas."
