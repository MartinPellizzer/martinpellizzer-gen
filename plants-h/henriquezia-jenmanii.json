    "intro": "Henriquezia jenmanii, commonly known as the Ecuadorian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Henriquezia jenmanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
