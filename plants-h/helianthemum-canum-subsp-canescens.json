It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, typically from April to June. The plant has grayish-green, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or Mediterranean climates. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
