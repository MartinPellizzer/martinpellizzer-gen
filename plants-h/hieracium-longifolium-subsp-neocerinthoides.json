    "intro": "Hieracium longifolium subsp. neocerinthoides, commonly known as the long-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy leaves. The subspecies is distinguished by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves and a more compact growth habit compared to other hawkweed species. It typically thrives in moist, grassy habitats and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant is also noted for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common sight in temperate regions."
