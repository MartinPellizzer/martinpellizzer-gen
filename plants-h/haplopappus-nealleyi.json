    "intro": "Haplopappus nealleyi, commonly known as the Nealley's pappus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typically herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Haplopappus nealleyi is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in desert or semi-desert regions."
