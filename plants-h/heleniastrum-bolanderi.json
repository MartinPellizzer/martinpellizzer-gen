    "intro": "Heleniastrum bolanderi, commonly known as Bolander's helianthella, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves and is adapted to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. It is often found in association with other coastal flora in serpentine soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
