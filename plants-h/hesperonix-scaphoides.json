    "intro": "Hesperonix scaphoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pale green, leaf-like stems and showy, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing on the trunks of trees in wetlands or swamps. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered in many regions."
