It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in crevices and on rocky outcrops, where it thrives in poor, well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with ray florets that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hieracium lithogenes is adapted to withstand harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
