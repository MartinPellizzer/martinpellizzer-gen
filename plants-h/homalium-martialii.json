It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its clusters of small, fleshy berries that turn a striking purple-red color in autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters and features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are inconspicuous, greenish-yellow, and appear in clusters, while the berries are a key feature for attracting birds. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
