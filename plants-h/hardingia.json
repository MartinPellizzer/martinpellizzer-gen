    "intro": "Hardingia, commonly known as mountain savory, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe, Asia, and Africa, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, often hairy leaves. The flowers are typically clustered in dense, branched inflorescences and are usually pink, purple, or red in color. Hardingia species are often used in rock gardens and as ornamental plants due to their hardiness and attractive appearance. They prefer well-drained soil and full sun, making them suitable for xeriscaping in arid climates."
