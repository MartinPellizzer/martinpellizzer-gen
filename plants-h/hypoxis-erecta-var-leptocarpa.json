It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or dry landscapes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
