    "intro": "Hypogynium campestre, commonly known as the field hypogynium, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are ovate with a prominent midrib and are often covered in fine hairs. The hypogynium, a specialized structure at the base of the flower, is a key feature in its reproductive biology."
