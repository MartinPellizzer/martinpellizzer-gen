    "intro": "Hypericum elatoides, commonly known as creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer, and its woody stems that root at the nodes. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a slightly serrated edge. Hypericum elatoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
