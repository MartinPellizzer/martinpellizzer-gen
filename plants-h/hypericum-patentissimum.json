    "intro": "Hypericum patentissimum, commonly known as the yellow St. John's wort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of about 30 cm, with woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. Its medicinal properties have been studied for their potential antidepressant and anti-inflammatory effects. However, it contains phototoxic compounds that can cause skin reactions when exposed to sunlight."
