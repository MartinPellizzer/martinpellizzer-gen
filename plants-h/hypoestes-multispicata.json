    "intro": "Hypoestes multispicata, commonly known as the \"Snowflake\" plant, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble small snowflakes. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a velvety texture and a bluish-green hue. It produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, often clustered in dense spikes. Hypoestes multispicata is typically grown as a container plant due to its preference for well-drained soil and bright, indirect light."
