    "intro": "Hieracium pseudolanatum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features basal rosettes of serrated, lance-shaped leaves and produces bright yellow ray flowers surrounded by tubular florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
