    "intro": "Herbertia darwinii, commonly known as Darwin's herb, is a striking tropical plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a rosette of broad, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces tall, erect flowering stems that bear showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink. These flowers are typically borne in clusters and bloom during the warmer months. Herbertia darwinii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to well-drained, sunny gardens."
