It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer months.

The plant is often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and other waterlogged areas where it thrives in partial to full shade."
