    "intro": "Hemionitis brownii, commonly known as the brown's hemionitis, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Hemionitidaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis brownii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
