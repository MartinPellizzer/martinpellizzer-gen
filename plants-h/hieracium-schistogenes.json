It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny environments. Its leaves are generally rough and hairy, with a distinctive silvery or greyish underside. The flowers are yellow, appearing in late summer to early autumn, and are followed by small, elongated achenes that are dispersed by wind."
