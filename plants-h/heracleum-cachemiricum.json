    "intro": "Heracleum cachemiricum, commonly known as the Kashmir giant hogweed, is a tall herbaceous plant native to the Himalayan regions of India, Nepal, and Pakistan. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its large, compound leaves and showy white flowers. The plant can grow up to 5 meters in height, with a thick, hairy stem that exudes a sap containing phototoxic compounds. Its flowers are arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the family, and it blooms from June to August. Due to its potential to cause severe skin irritation, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
