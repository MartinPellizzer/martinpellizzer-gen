    "intro": "Hoffmannia bernardii var. bernardii, commonly known as the African violet, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of velvety, waxy leaves and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of violet, pink, and white. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and requires indirect sunlight to prevent leaf scorch. It is widely cultivated as a popular houseplant due to its ornamental value and ease of care. The flowers are typically borne on tall, erect stalks above the foliage, adding a striking visual contrast."
