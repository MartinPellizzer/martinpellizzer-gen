    "intro": "Houstonia, commonly known as bluemink, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. These plants are native to eastern North America and are often found in moist, wooded areas. They are characterized by their small, delicate flowers that range in color from blue to white. Houstonia species typically grow in dense mats, forming a low-growing ground cover. Their leaves are usually opposite and have a fine, matted texture, contributing to their ornamental appeal."
