    "intro": "Hakea prominens, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are arranged in cylindrical spikes. It thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden winds. Hakea prominens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
