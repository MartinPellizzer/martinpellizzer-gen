    "intro": "Hydrocotyle himalaica subsp. himalaica, commonly known as Himalayan spurge, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a rosette of rounded, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the cold, mountainous climate of its native range. Its botanical features make it an important species in alpine ecosystems and a subject of study in plant taxonomy."
