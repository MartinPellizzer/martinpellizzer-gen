    "intro": "Hakea psilorrhyncha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in arid conditions. The plant produces cylindrical, pink to red flower spikes that bloom in summer, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and dense growth habit make it well-suited for coastal and sandy soils. Hakea psilorrhyncha is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in native gardens."
