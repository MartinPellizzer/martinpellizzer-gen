    "intro": "Hydrocotyle pilifera, commonly known as the hairy water pennywort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense mats near the water's edge. The plant has rounded, floating leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Hydrocotyle pilifera plays a role in stabilizing aquatic environments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
