    "intro": "Haplopappus cerberoanus, commonly known as the desert sandweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in desert and semi-desert environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, white pappus structures that aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Haplopappus cerberoanus plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
