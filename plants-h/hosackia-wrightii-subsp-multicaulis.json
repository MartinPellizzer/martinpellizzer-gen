    "intro": "Hosackia wrightii subsp. multicaulis, commonly known as the multicaulis prairie clover, is a perennial herb native to the central United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in prairie and open woodland habitats. It is adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common component of native grassland ecosystems. Its subspecific name, *multicaulis*, refers to its multiple stems, which contribute to its distinctive appearance."
