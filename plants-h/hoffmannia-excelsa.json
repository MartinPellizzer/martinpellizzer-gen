    "intro": "Hoffmannia excelsa, commonly known as the African violet, is a striking flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its velvety, waxy leaves and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters in its natural habitat. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure. Hoffmannia excelsa is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
