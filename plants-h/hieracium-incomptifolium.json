It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, and it thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a single head. Hieracium incomptifolium is often found in moist soil and can spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some areas."
