    "intro": "Huernia insigniflora, commonly known as the naked lady or ghost flower, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and clustered, tubular flowers. The plant produces showy, pale yellow or orange flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, giving it a unique, almost otherworldly appearance. Huernia insigniflora is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems for survival."
