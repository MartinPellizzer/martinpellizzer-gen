    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 bifurcum subsp. sterromastix, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential weed in certain regions."
