    "intro": "Habenaria malacophylla var. shabaensis, commonly known as the Shaba ghost orchid, is a rare and exquisite orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its striking, pale pink to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in the dense canopy of the rainforest. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a dense, velvety coating that helps retain moisture in the humid environment. This orchid is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat destruction."
