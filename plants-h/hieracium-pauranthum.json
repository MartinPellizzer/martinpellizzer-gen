    "intro": "Hieracium pauranthum, commonly known as the sand mat or sand daisy, is a flowering plant native to sandy and coastal regions of Europe and North America. It is a low-growing perennial with a mat-like growth habit, featuring small, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
