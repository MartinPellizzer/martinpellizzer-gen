    "intro": "Hieracium eucomoides, commonly known as the European meadow hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and is typically found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils across Europe. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. Hieracium eucomoides is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid spread and adaptability."
