    "intro": "Hedyotis pilosissima, commonly known as the silky knotweed, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, opposite leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne in terminal spikes. Its flowering period occurs during the summer months, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Hedyotis pilosissima is valued in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
