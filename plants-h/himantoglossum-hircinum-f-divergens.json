    "intro": "Himantoglossum hircinum f. divergens, commonly known as the divergent hare's foot, is a rare and distinctive plant species belonging to the orchid family. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a spurred lip that is often more elongated than in other members of the species. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and is found in specific regions of Europe, particularly in the British Isles. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, and it blooms with small, pale yellow to green flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
