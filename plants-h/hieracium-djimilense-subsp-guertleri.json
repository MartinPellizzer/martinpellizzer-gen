    "intro": "Hieracium djimilense subsp. guertleri, commonly known as the Guertler's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in East Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically features yellow or orange disc flowers surrounded by ray florets, and its leaves are usually hairy and lance-shaped. It thrives in open, often disturbed habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
