    "intro": "Hedyotis connata, commonly known as the mountain geranium, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red, with five petals and prominent stamens. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Hedyotis connata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural environment."
