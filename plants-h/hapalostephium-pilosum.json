    "intro": "Hapalostephium pilosum, commonly known as the silky grass or silky bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, blue-violet flowers, which are clustered in dense, fluffy structures. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Hapalostephium pilosum is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and sandy soils."
