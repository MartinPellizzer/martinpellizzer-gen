    "intro": "Hieracium maculatum subsp. inquinatum, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and roadsides. It has basal leaves that are often hairy and covered in yellowish glands, and its flowers are usually yellow with purple markings. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in some regions."
