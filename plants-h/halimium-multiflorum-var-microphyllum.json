    "intro": "Halimium multiflorum var. microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved rock rose, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact form, hairy stems, and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, tubular flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or Mediterranean climates. This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to withstand drought conditions."
