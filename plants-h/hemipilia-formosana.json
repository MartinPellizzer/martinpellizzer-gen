    "intro": "Hemipilia formosana, commonly known as the Formosan hemipilia, is a rare flowering plant native to Taiwan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by attracting insects. Due to habitat loss, Hemipilia formosana is considered endangered and is protected in its native region."
