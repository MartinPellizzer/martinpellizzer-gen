    "intro": "Hoya apoensis var. sagittarius, commonly known as the arrow-shaped wax plant, is a tropical epiphytic species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy, and waxy leaves that are typically arrow-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hoya apoensis var. sagittarius is popular among indoor gardeners for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
