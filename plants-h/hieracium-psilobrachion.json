    "intro": "Hieracium psilobrachion, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish to reddish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
