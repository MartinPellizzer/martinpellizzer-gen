    "intro": "Hieracium prussicum subsp. macroglossum, commonly known as the large-tongued hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to central and eastern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and erect, branched stems. The plant produces yellow flowers with a distinctive, tongue-like shape, which is adapted for pollination by long-tongued insects such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often in sunny to partially shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
