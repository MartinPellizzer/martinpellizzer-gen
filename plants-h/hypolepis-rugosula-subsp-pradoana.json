    "intro": "Hypolepis rugosula subsp. pradoana, commonly known as the Prado's shield fern, is a tropical fern species native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the substrate. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, which aids in attracting certain pollinators and enhancing its ecological role in the ecosystem."
