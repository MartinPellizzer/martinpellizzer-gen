    "intro": "Hypericum pimeleoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, orange-red seed capsules that contain the seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Hypericum pimeleoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
