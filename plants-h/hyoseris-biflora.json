    "intro": "Hyoseris biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered hyoseris, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and often aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky slopes. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, producing small, oval-shaped fruits that are dispersed by wind. Hyoseris biflora is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antifungal properties."
