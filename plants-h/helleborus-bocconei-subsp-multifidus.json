    "intro": "Helleborus bocconei subsp. multifidus, commonly known as the Italian hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features dark green, leathery leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of pale green to white flowers with prominent, showy petals that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its flowers are typically surrounded by a ring of spathaceous bracts, which are modified leaves that protect the flower buds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
