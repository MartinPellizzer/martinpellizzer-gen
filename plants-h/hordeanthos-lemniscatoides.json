    "intro": "Hordeanthos lemniscatoides, commonly known as the lemon scented horsetail, is a unique plant with distinctive botanical features. It belongs to the Equisetaceae family, which includes ancient vascular plants often referred to as \"living fossils.\" The plant is characterized by its whorled arrangement of branches and its ability to produce spores rather than seeds. Its leaves are typically small and scale-like, and it has a hollow, jointed stem that gives it a primitive appearance. Hordeanthos lemniscatoides is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its aromatic properties."
