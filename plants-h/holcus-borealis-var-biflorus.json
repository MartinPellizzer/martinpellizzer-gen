    "intro": "Holcus borealis var. biflorus, commonly known as the northern basket grass, is a perennial grass species native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows, bogs, and stream sides. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often tinged with purple or red. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments. Holcus borealis var. biflorus is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
