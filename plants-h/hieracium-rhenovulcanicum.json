    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracesium rhenovulcanicum, commonly known as the volcanic hawkweed, is a rare flowering plant native to the volcanic regions of Germany. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, nutrient-poor soils, thriving in the unique microclimates of volcanic landscapes. It has narrow, hairy leaves and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
