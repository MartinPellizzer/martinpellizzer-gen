It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and purple or violet flowers.

It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in waste areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
