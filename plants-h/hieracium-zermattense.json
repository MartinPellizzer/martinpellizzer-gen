    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracesium zermattense, commonly known as the Zermatt hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky and open habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are generally basal, with a rough, hairy texture, and its flowers are yellow, often appearing in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
