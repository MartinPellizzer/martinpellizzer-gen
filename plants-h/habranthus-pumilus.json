    "intro": "Habranthus pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf spiderwort, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to South America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically produces white or pale blue blossoms that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or containers. Due to its low maintenance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
