It is characterized by its grayish-white hairs that cover the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, silvery appearance. The plant produces yellow daisy-like flowers with a central disk surrounded by ray florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.
