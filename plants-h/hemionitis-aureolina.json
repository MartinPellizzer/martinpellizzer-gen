    "intro": "Hemionitis aureolina, commonly known as the golden fern, is a unique aquatic plant native to the wetlands of eastern Asia. It has a distinctive, delicate appearance with small, bright green, fan-shaped fronds that resemble a fern. The plant thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving water and is often found in marshy areas. Its leaves are typically submerged or floating, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are rarely seen. Hemionitis aureolina is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting aquatic life."
