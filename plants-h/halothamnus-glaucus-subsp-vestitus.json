    "intro": "Halothamnus glaucus subsp. vestitus, commonly known as the white-haired saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it an important component of coastal and desert ecosystems. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it valuable for erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
