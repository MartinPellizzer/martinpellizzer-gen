    "intro": "Hymenolobus procumbens subsp. prostii, commonly known as the creeping hymenolobus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of southern Africa. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
