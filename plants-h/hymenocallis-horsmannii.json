It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy white flowers with a distinctive yellow throat. The plant features strap-like, dark green leaves that form a rosette at the base. It produces a tall, slender stem that bears the flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Hymenocallis horsmannii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil with adequate sunlight."
