    "intro": "Hieracium tauschii subsp. pseudomagyariciforme, commonly known as the Hungarian hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming basal leaves and yellow flowering heads. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. It has fibrous roots and produces numerous ray florets that are often sterile, giving it a distinctive appearance. This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its potential role in hybridization with other hawkweed species."
