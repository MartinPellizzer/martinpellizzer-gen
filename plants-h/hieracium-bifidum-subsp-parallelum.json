    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. parallelum, commonly known as the parallel-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are distinctive for their parallel venation and divided lobes, which give it its common name. It produces yellow ray florets surrounded by tubular disc florets, typical of the genus Hieracium."
