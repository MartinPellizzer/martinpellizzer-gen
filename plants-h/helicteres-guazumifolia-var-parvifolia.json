    "intro": "Helicteres guazumifolia var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-flowered candlewood, is a tropical shrub native to Central America and the Caribbean. It features compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets arranged oppositely along the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, often with a distinctive waxy coating. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in warm climates for its unique foliage and floral display."
