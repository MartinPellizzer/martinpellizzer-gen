    "intro": "Habenaria lastelleana, commonly known as the Lastellean orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pale green or yellowish in color, with three sepals and three petals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
