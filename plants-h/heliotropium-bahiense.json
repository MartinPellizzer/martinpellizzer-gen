    "intro": "Heliotropium bahiense, commonly known as the coastal heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of South America. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or saline soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually pink or purple, which bloom in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, aiding in moisture retention. Heliotropium bahiense is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems."
