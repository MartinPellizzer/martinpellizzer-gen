    "intro": "Hieracium floccipedunculum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family (Compositae). It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes and can form dense patches in suitable habitats. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
