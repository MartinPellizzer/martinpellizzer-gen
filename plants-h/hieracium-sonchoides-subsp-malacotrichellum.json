It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 50 cm. The plant features basal and stem leaves that are lance-shaped with rough, hairy surfaces. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped cluster, and the plant produces small, oblong achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. It is characterized by its yellow coloration and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
