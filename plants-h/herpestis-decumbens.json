    "intro": "Herpestis decumbens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It typically features sprawling stems that lie close to the ground, often rooting at the nodes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually blue or violet in color, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Herpestis decumbens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks."
