    "intro": "Habenaria similis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its roots are often found in symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
