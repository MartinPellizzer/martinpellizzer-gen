    "intro": "Hakea linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces cylindrical, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and ability to thrive in dry conditions make it well adapted to its native environment. Hakea linearifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
