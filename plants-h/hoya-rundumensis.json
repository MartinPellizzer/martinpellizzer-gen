    "intro": "Hoya rundumensis, commonly known as the Rundumensis Wax Plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apocynaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. Hoya rundumensis is a trailing plant that produces aerial roots, allowing it to climb or hang from supports. It is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
