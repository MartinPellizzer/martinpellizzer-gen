    "intro": "Hemarthria, commonly known as silvergrass, is a genus of grasses native to the Americas. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Hemarthria species are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Some species are also cultivated for ornamental purposes."
