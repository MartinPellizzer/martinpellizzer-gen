    "intro": "Hemarthria depressa, commonly known as carpet grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, dense foliage and rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to form thick mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in terminal spikes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, pastures, and disturbed areas. Hemarthria depressa is valued for its erosion control capabilities and ornamental appeal."
