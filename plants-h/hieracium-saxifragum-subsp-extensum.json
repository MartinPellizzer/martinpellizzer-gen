    "intro": "Hieracium saxifragum subsp. extensum, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands, roadsides, and rocky areas. The plant features basal rosettes of broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters at the top of the stem. It has a fibrous root system and is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. The subspecies extensum is distinguished by its larger leaves and more extensive flowering structures compared to other members of the species."
