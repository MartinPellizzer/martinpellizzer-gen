    "intro": "Hypericum quadrangulum var. subcorymbosum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in compact clusters. The plant has opposite, narrow, and slightly serrated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its medicinal properties have been studied for their potential anti-inflammatory and antidepressant effects."
