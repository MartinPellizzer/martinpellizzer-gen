    "intro": "Hemitelia latebrosa, commonly known as the coastal hemitelia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Hemitelia latebrosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
