    "intro": "Hymenolepis squamata var. borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean flatworm, is a species of flatworm found in tropical regions. It belongs to the family Dendrocoelidae and is characterized by its flattened body and segmented structure. This organism is primarily found in moist soil and leaf litter, where it plays a role in decomposing organic matter. It lacks a true digestive system and absorbs nutrients through its skin. Due to its small size and cryptic behavior, it is often overlooked in ecological studies."
