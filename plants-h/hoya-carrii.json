    "intro": "Hoya carrii, commonly known as the \"Coral Hoya,\" is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often resembling coral in appearance. Hoya carrii is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in bright, indirect light. It is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
