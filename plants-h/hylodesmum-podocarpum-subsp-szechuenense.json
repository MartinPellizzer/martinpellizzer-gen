    "intro": "Hylodesmum podocarpum subsp. szechuenense, commonly known as the Sichuan hylodesmum, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, which bloom in spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
