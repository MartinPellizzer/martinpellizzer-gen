    "intro": "Huperzia cubana, commonly known as the Cuban huperzia, is a species of fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its primitive morphology, featuring simple, linear leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant is native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba, and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Huperzia cubana has a sporophyte life cycle, producing spores rather than seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies in evolutionary botany and conservation."
