    "intro": "Halimodendron speciosum, commonly known as the desert rose or Persian lilac, is a shrub native to arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It features woody stems with dense clusters of fragrant, pink or white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
