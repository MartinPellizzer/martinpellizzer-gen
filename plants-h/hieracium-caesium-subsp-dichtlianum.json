It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and tall flowering stems. The plant produces yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a weed in agricultural areas and natural habitats."
