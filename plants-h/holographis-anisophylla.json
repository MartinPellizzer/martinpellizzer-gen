    "intro": "Holographis anisophylla, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a unique fern species characterized by its distinctive, undulating fronds. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a zigzag pattern that gives it its common name. The plant exhibits anisophyllous leaves, meaning the upper and lower leaves are structurally different. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The fronds are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and can be propagated through spores or division."
