    "intro": "Hedysarum leucophyllum, commonly known as the white-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves and showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh conditions. Hedysarum leucophyllum is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and prevent soil erosion."
