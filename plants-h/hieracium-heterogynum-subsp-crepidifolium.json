    "intro": "Hieracium heterogynum subsp. crepidifolium, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a low-growing habit with a mat-forming structure, characterized by its creeping stems that root at the nodes. The leaves are typically lanceolate to ovate, with a rough texture and a distinctive basal rosette. Its flowers are yellow, occurring in clusters, and are surrounded by bracts that are often mistaken for petals. This subspecies is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas."
