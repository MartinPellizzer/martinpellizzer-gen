It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces striking, bottlebrush-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often appearing in late winter to early spring. Hakea kedumbensis is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salty air, making it suitable for coastal gardens. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environments."
