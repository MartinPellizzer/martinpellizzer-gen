    "intro": "Hypolepis glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated fronds that are often covered with small glands, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, which help anchor it in soil and absorb nutrients. The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in attracting pollinators."
