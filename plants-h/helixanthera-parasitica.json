    "intro": "Helixanthera parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic helixanthera, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows in dense forest undergrowth, where it attaches to the roots of other vegetation. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a mix of white and yellow hues. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Helixanthera parasitica is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
