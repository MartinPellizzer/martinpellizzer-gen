    "intro": "Habenaria densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and mountainous regions. The plant features a slender rhizome and produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive spurred lip. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
