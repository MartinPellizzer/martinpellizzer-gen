    "intro": "Hedyotis equisetiformis, commonly known as the threadleaf bedstraw, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, wiry stems that are often covered with fine, thread-like hairs, giving it its common name. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in early summer. The leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive botanical appearance."
