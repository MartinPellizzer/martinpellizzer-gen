    "intro": "Helianthemum apenninum var. virgatum, commonly known as the white rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to rocky or coastal landscapes. The plant has aromatic, glandular leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wool, aiding in moisture retention. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal gardens. This variety is closely related to other members of the Cistaceae family, sharing similar adaptations to arid environments."
