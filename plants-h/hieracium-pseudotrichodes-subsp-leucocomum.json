It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in composite heads, typical of the daisy family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grassy areas. Its botanical features make it distinguishable from other hawkweed species, particularly its white or pale-colored hairs."
