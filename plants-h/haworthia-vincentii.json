It belongs to the Asphodelaceae family and is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves. The leaves are typically green with white or pale blue markings, which help in photosynthesis and water retention. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments."
