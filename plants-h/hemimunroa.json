    "intro": "Hemimunroa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed hemimunroa, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees, and is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pale pink flowers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Hemimunroa is typically found in damp, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
