    "intro": "Haplopappus corymbosus, commonly known as the clustered pappus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive bracts. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a low, sprawling growth habit. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in dense clusters, and the plant produces fluffy, white pappus structures that aid in seed dispersal. Haplopappus corymbosus is adapted to arid environments and is often found in desert or semi-desert regions."
