    "intro": "Hymenophyllum crispum var. bipinnatisectum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hymenophyllum, is a fern belonging to the Hymenophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery, and often curling fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant has a finely divided, bipinnatisect leaf structure, giving it a lacy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its small, spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
