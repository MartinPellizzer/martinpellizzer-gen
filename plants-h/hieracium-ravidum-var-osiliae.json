    "intro": "Hieracium ravidum var. osiliae, commonly known as the Osilia hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are usually basal, with a rough, hairy texture, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. This variant is distinguished by its smaller flower heads and more compact growth form compared to other hawkweed species."
