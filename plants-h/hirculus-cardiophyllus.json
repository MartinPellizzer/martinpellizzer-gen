    "intro": "Hirculus cardiophyllus, commonly known as the heart-leaf hirculus, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves, which are thick and waxy to reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It has a deep root system that allows it to access moisture from deep underground. Due to habitat destruction, Hirculus cardiophyllus is classified as an endangered species."
