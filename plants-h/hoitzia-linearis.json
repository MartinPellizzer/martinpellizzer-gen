    "intro": "Hoitzia linearis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hoitzia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, linear leaves and small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green to white in color. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by small insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Hoitzia linearis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates."
