It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellowish to orange flower heads. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is often found in temperate climates. It has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, with flowering stems that bear clusters of small, composite flowers. The subspecies integratum is distinguished by its more robust growth and slightly larger flowers compared to other related hawkweed species."
