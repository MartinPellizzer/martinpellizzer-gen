    "intro": "Hypericum aciculare, commonly known as the needle-stem St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, woody stems covered in small, needle-like leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Hypericum aciculare is valued for its ornamental appeal and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
