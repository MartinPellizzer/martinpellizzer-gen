    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. farinosiceps, commonly known as the sticky hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is notable for its glandular trichomes, which give the leaves and stems a sticky texture. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The subspecies is distinguished by its elongated, cylindrical flower heads and the presence of farina, a powdery coating on the bracts."
