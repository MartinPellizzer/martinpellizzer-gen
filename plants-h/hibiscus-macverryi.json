    "intro": "Hibiscus macverryi, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically blooming in summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Hibiscus macverryi is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 feet tall, with woody stems and hairy young shoots. It plays an important role in desert ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals."
