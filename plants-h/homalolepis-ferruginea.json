    "intro": "Homalolepis ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, rusty-colored bloom, which gives it its common name. The spore-producing structures, or sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
