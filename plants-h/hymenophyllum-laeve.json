    "intro": "Hymenophyllum laeve, commonly known as the smooth hymenophyllum, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are covered with a dense layer of fine, scale-like structures that help reduce water loss. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in small, round groups."
