    "intro": "Hieracium oligasterum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun. It has a low-growing habit with narrow, hairy leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes considered a rare or endangered species in certain regions."
