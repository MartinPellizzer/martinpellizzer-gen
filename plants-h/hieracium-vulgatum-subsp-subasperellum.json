    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. subasperellum, commonly known as the rough hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and yellow flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers are composite, consisting of ray florets and disk florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The subspecies is distinguished by its coarser leaves and more robust growth compared to other members of the Hieracium genus."
