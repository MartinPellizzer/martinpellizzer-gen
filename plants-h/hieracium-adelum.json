    "intro": "Hieracium adelum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the summer months, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium adelum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas."
