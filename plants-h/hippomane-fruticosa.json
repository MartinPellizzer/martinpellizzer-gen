    "intro": "Hippomane fruticosa, commonly known as the Brazilian rubber tree, is a flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense foliage, with small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red fruits containing seeds. It is related to the rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) and has historically been used for its latex, though it is less commercially valuable than its close relative. Due to its ecological importance and unique adaptations, it plays a significant role in the biodiversity of its native habitat."
