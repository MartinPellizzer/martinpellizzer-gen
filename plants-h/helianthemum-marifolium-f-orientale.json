It is a low-growing shrub with compact, succulent leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
