    "intro": "Hieracium pseudostygium, commonly known as the false ragwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, often in sunny locations. It has yellow-orange flower heads composed of numerous small florets, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a rough texture. Hieracium pseudostygium is often mistaken for other similar species within the Hieracium genus due to its similar appearance."
