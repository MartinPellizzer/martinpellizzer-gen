    "intro": "Hohenbergia blanchetii, commonly known as the white-flowered hohenbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. Its foliage is evergreen and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. Hohenbergia blanchetii is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
