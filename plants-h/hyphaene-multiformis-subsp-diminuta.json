    "intro": "Hyphaene multiformis subsp. diminuta, commonly known as the dwarf date palm, is a small, slow-growing palm native to Madagascar. It features a slender trunk and gracefully arching fronds that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences, and its flowers are typically unisexual, with separate male and female structures. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. The subspecies is notable for its compact size and ornamental value in tropical gardens."
