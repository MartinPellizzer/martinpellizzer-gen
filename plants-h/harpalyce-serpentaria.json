It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, winding stems that often resemble a serpent. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, which are typical of the genus Harpalyce. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and have a distinctive, fern-like appearance. Harpalyce serpentaria is often found in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in open woodlands."
