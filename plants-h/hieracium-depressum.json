    "intro": "Hieracium depressum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features broad, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Hieracium depressum is typically found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, where it spreads via rhizomes and stolons. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and a common weed in agricultural settings."
