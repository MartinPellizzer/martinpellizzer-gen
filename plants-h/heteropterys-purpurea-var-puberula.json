    "intro": "Heteropterys purpurea var. puberula, commonly known as the purple-flowered velvetleaf, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are pubescent, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to purple, often with a slight pinkish hue. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature, contributing to its propagation in the wild. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
