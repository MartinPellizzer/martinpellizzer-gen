    "intro": "Hellenia oblonga, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hellenia, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Hellenia oblonga is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and flowering habit."
