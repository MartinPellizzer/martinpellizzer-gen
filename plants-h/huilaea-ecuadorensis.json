    "intro": "Huilaea ecuadorensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorean huilaea, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean region of Ecuador. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a common feature among bromeliads. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in vibrant colors that attract pollinators. Huilaea ecuadorensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in rocky crevices."
