    "intro": "Helichrysum montosicola, commonly known as the mountain everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, bright yellow to orange flowers that resemble daisies. The plant produces numerous tiny, papery bracts that give it a fluffy appearance, often mistaken for actual flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Helichrysum montosicola is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in dried flower arrangements."
