    "intro": "Horsfieldia penangiana subsp. penangiana, commonly known as the Penang orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the tropical rainforests of Peninsular Malaysia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
