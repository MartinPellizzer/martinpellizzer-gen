    "intro": "Hosta liliiflora, commonly known as the Lily-leaved Hosta, is a perennial plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its broad, dark green leaves that are often adorned with a silvery-blue hue. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is well-suited for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its delicate floral display."
