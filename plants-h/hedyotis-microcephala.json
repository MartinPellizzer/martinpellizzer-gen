    "intro": "Hedyotis microcephala, commonly known as the small-headed bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Asia. It typically features slender, prostrate stems covered in fine hairs, with small, opposite leaves that are usually oval to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Hedyotis microcephala is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
