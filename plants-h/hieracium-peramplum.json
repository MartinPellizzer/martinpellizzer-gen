    "intro": "Hieracium peramplum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in a flat-topped cluster. The plant has hairy, rough stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Native to Europe, it is an invasive species in many parts of the world due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils."
