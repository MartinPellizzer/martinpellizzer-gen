    "intro": "Helichrysum korongoni, commonly known as the Korongoni everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that remain intact for a long period, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Helichrysum korongoni is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in floral arrangements due to its ability to retain its color and form after drying."
