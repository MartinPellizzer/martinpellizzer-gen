    "intro": "Hosackia micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered hoary vetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its trifoliate leaves and pod-like fruits are typical of the Fabaceae family. Hosackia micrantha plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
