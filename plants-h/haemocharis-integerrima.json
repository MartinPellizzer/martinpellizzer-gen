It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking, bright orange-red flowers with a distinctive yellow center. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden areas."
