    "intro": "Hovea cymbiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hovea, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the spring and summer seasons. Its seeds are enclosed in pod-like fruits that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Hovea cymbiformis is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
