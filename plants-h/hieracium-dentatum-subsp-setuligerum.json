    "intro": "Hieracium dentatum subsp. setuligerum, commonly known as the rough-edged hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and serrated leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
