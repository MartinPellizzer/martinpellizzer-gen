It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are often heart-shaped or ovate in form. This plant is native to Europe and thrives in shaded, moist environments, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Hedera poetarum produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by dark blue berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. Its ornamental value and historical association with poets have contributed to its cultural significance throughout history."
