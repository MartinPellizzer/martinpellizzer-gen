    "intro": "Hieracium pseudobifidum subsp. caespitiferum, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It typically grows in dry, sunny grasslands and open woodlands, forming dense, low-growing clumps. The plant features basal leaves that are narrowly lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowering stems bear yellow composite flowers. It produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in disturbed soils."
