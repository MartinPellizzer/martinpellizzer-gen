    "intro": "Hypolepis rugosula subsp. rugosula, commonly known as the rough fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, rough-textured fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spores in clusters on the underside of its fronds, a common feature among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its morphology and reproductive structures make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
