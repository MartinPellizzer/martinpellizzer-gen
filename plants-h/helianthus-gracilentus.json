    "intro": "Helianthus gracilentus, commonly known as the slender sunflower, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and wetlands. The plant features upright, branching stems covered in soft, hairy foliage, and it produces yellow daisy-like flowers with dark centers. Its botanical characteristics include narrow, lance-shaped leaves and composite flower heads that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Helianthus gracilentus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological value and adaptability to waterlogged environments."
