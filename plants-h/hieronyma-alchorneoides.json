    "intro": "Hieronyma alchorneoides, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Pitanga*, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its dense, glossy green foliage and bright red, cherry-like fruits that ripen in the rainy season. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, adding to its ornamental value. Its fruits are edible, though they are typically consumed raw or used in traditional remedies. The tree is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been historically used in construction and craftsmanship."
