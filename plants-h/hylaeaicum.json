    "intro": "Hylaeaicum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, thin roots and produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Hylaeaicum is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
