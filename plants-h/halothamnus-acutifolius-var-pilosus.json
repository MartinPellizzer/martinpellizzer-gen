    "intro": "Halothamnus acutifolius var. pilosus, commonly known as the hairy leafed halothamnus, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and small, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in poor, well-drained soils. Its hairy foliage helps reduce water loss, making it well-suited for drought conditions."
