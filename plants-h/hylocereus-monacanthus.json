It is characterized by its spiny stems and large, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers with a strong, sweet scent, which attract nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. Its fruit, known as the dragon fruit, is edible and has a vibrant pink or yellow color with a sweet, mild flavor. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit."
