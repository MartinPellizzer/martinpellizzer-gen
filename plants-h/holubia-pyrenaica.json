    "intro": "Holubia pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean holubia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
