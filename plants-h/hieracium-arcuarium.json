    "intro": "Hieracium arcuarium, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. It produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat."
