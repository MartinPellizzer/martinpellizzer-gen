    "intro": "Hordeum brevisubulatum subsp. iranicum, commonly known as the Iranian slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period occurs in the spring to early summer, and it is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its resilience and role in local ecosystems."
