It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, characterized by its low, spreading growth habit. The plant features basal rosettes of dark green, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in early summer. It has a fibrous root system adapted to poor, well-drained soils. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh alpine conditions."
