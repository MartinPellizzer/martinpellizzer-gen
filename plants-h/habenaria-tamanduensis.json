    "intro": "Habenaria tamanduensis, commonly known as the Tamandua orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it produces inflorescences with multiple small, colorful flowers. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or tropical gardens."
