    "intro": "Hepetis kegeliana, commonly known as the Kegel's heather, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically hairy and lance-shaped, adapted to thrive in cooler, high-altitude environments. Hepetis kegeliana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
