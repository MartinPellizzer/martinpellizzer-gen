    "intro": "Hieracium kalmii var. canadense, commonly known as Canadian hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, along roadsides, and in open woodlands. It has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces numerous small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
