    "intro": "Hymenophyllum boutonii, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds covered in minute, scale-like structures called trichomes. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its leaves are typically narrow and closely spaced, with a unique, almost moss-like appearance. Hymenophyllum boutonii is notable for its ability to retain moisture, which helps it survive in its often-dry habitat."
