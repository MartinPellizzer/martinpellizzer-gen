    "intro": "Hexaptera frigida, commonly known as the cold-tolerant fern, is a unique plant species adapted to harsh, cold environments. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that often curl tightly to protect against frost. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered on the underside of the leaves. Hexaptera frigida thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its ability to survive in low-temperature conditions makes it an important indicator species for ecological studies in cold climates."
