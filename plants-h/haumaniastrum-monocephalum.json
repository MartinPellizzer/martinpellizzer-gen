    "intro": "Haumaniastrum monocephalum, commonly known as the single-headed desert lily, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family, characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a short, sturdy stem with a single, large, waxy flower that can reach up to 12 inches in length. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to minimize water loss in its harsh environment. The plant is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
