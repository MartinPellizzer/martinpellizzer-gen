    "intro": "Helicia integrifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf helenia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Theaceae and is characterized by its smooth, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically broad and entire. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in umbels, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation projects."
