    "intro": "Hieracium praecox subsp. acrocampylum, commonly known as the early hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in early summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It has a fibrous root system and is often found in temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in certain environments."
