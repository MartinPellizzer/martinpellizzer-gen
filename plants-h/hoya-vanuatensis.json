    "intro": "Hoya vanuatensis, commonly known as the Vanuatu waxplant, is a species of flowering plant native to the island of Vanuatu in the South Pacific. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Hoya vanuatensis is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
