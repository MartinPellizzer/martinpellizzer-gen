    "intro": "Helosciadium nodiflorum var. repentiforme, commonly known as the creeping helosciadium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with slender, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface, and it prefers well-drained, sandy or rocky soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
