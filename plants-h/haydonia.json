    "intro": "Haydonia, commonly known as the golden cup, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Haydonia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
