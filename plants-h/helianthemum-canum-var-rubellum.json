It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine, woolly coating. The plant produces vibrant red or pink flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, sturdy stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for Mediterranean climates."
