It is characterized by its striking, spider-like appearance with long, slender petals and sepals that resemble legs. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or green with intricate patterns, and it blooms during the rainy season. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
