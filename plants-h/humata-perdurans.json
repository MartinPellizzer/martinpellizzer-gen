    "intro": "Humata perdurans, commonly known as the everlasting humata, is a unique plant species characterized by its long-lasting flowers. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is native to arid regions of South America. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered yellow flowers that remain open for extended periods. Its ability to retain its floral structure for weeks makes it a popular choice for dried floral arrangements. Humata perdurans is also valued for its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
