    "intro": "Hakea leucopoda, commonly known as the white-leaf hakea, is a species of flowering plant native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive cylindrical or conical inflorescences. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, often appearing in late winter to early spring. Hakea leucopoda is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, featuring thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance."
