    "intro": "Hydrosme purpurea, commonly known as the purple hydrosme, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, purple-pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its roots are adapted to absorb water efficiently. Hydrosme purpurea plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various insects and contributing to water filtration."
