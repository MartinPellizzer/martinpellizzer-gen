    "intro": "Humulus volubilis, commonly known as hops, is a climbing herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its vigorous growth habit, with long, flexible stems that twine around supports. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-yellow flowers that develop into cone-like structures called strobiles. These cones are the primary part used in brewing beer, containing compounds that contribute to flavor, aroma, and preservation. Botanically, it belongs to the Cannabaceae family and is closely related to hemp and other Cannabis species."
