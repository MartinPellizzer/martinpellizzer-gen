    "intro": "Hydrocotyle fluitans, commonly known as floating pennywort, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the Americas. It features small, rounded leaves that float on the water surface, with short petioles that anchor it to the substrate. The plant produces white, star-shaped flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It spreads rapidly through both seeds and vegetative propagation, making it an invasive species in many regions. Its presence can alter water chemistry and outcompete native plants for resources."
