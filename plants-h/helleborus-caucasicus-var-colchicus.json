    "intro": "Helleborus caucasicus var. colchicus, commonly known as the Caucasian hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features dark green, glossy leaves that are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is well-suited for woodland gardens. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets."
