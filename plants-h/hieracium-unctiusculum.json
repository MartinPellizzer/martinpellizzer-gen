    "intro": "Hieracium unctiusculum, commonly known as the sticky hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant is recognized for its hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which can adhere to animals and clothing. Its yellow flowers bloom in summer, and it often grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed."
