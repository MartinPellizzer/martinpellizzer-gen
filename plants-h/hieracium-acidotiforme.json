    "intro": "Hieracium acidotiforme, commonly known as the acid-forming hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in acidic soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat, disk-like structure. Hieracium acidotiforme is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments, making it a common pioneer species in ecological succession."
