    "intro": "Hieracium glaucinum subsp. baieri, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features a low-growing rosette of basal leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving them a grayish-green appearance, and the stems are often reddish in color. This subspecies is adapted to harsh mountain environments and is considered a characteristic component of alpine vegetation."
