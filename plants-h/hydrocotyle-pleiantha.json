    "intro": "Hydrocotyle pleiantha, commonly known as the broadleaf water shield, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features floating leaves that are broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, and it has rhizomes that allow it to spread through submerged stems. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms. Hydrocotyle pleiantha thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments."
