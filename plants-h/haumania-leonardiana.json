    "intro": "Haumania leonardiana, commonly known as the Leonard's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Colombia. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with translucent, waxy leaves and delicate, pale pink or white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
