    "intro": "Hieracium koernickeanum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Hieracium koernickeanum is often found in moist environments and can spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some areas."
