    "intro": "Hieracium fallax subsp. exstolonosum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are usually hairy and have a rough texture. Its flowering stems bear clusters of yellow flowers with ray florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats."
