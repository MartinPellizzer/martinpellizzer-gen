    "intro": "Haloragis erecta subsp. cartilaginea, commonly known as the cartilaginous willow herb, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its erect growth habit and hairy, sometimes glandular stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are usually narrow and often covered with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The subspecies is distinguished by its thickened, cartilaginous stem tissue, which gives it its common name."
