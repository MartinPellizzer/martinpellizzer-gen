    "intro": "Hedera cambwoodiana, commonly known as the Cambwood ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful ground cover and an invasive species in some regions."
