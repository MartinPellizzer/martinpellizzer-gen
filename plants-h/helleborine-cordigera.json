It is characterized by its dark green, broadly elliptical leaves and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a faintly fragrant scent. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil in its habitat.
