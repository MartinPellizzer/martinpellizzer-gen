    "intro": "Hicorius tetraptera, commonly known as the four-winged orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that resemble orchids, though it belongs to the orchid family. The plant has a slender, upright stem with leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped. Its most distinctive feature is the four-winged structure of its fruit, which aids in wind dispersal. Hicorius tetraptera thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
