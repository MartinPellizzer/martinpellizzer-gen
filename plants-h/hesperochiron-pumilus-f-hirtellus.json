    "intro": "Hesperochiron pumilus f. hirtellus, commonly known as the hairy dwarf twayblade, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the orchid family (Orchidaceae). It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy stems, which distinguish it from other members of the Hesperochiron genus. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in a spike, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
