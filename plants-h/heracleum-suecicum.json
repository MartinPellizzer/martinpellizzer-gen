    "intro": "Heracleum suecicum, commonly known as Swedish cow parsley, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbellate flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and streambanks. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Heracleum suecicum is often mistaken for other similar plants due to its delicate appearance, but it can be distinguished by its hairy stems and specific habitat preferences."
