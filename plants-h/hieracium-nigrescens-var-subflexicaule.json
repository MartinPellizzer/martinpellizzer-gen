    "intro": "Hieracium nigrescens var. subflexicaule, commonly known as the bent-stem hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant has hairy, ascending stems that often curve downward near the base, giving it its distinctive appearance. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster. This variety is characterized by its shorter, more flexible stems compared to the typical form of H. nigrescens."
