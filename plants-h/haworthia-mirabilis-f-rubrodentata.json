It features a dense rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves with a distinctive red or pinkish border along the edges. The leaves are typically shorter and more rounded compared to the parent species, with a unique reddish coloration that intensifies in sunlight. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers on tall, slender stems during the spring or summer. This cultivar is prized for its attractive appearance and ease of care, making it a popular choice for indoor and rock garden settings."
