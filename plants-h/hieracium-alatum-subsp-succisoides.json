It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are hairy and lobed, while its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
