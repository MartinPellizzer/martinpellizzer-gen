It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hieracium leucopsis typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its foliage is usually hairy and has a distinctive, somewhat fern-like appearance."
