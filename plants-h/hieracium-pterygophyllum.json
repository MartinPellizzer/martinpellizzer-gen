    "intro": "Hieracium pterygophyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves and yellow ray florets surrounding disk flowers. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
