    "intro": "Henriettella manarae, commonly known as the Manarae's henriettella, is a rare and unique plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that exhibit a vibrant green color with subtle variegation. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the wet season. Henriettella manarae is a climbing vine that relies on its tendrils to support itself among the dense foliage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
