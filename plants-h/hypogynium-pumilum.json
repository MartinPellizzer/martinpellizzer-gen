    "intro": "Hypogynium pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf hypogynium, is a small, herbaceous plant native to certain regions of South America. It features a compact growth habit with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its reproductive structures are located near the base of the plant, which is a characteristic feature of the genus. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
