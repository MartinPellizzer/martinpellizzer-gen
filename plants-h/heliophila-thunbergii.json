    "intro": "Heliophila thunbergii, commonly known as the water starwort, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marshy environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, with elongated, narrow leaves that help it thrive in moist conditions. It is often found in association with other aquatic or semi-aquatic plants, contributing to the biodiversity of wetland ecosystems. Heliophila thunbergii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
