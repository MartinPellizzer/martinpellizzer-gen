    "intro": "Homalodiscus ochradeni, commonly known as the African blue milkweed, is a flowering plant native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom throughout the year in some regions. Its sap contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
