It forms a crustose or foliose growth on rock surfaces, typically in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, which contribute to its ability to survive in harsh conditions. Its chemical composition includes various secondary metabolites that provide protection against environmental stressors. Hartogia lediformis plays a role in soil stabilization and is an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
