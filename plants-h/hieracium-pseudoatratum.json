    "intro": "Hieracium pseudoatratum, commonly known as the false hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy, with yellow flowers that bloom from June to August. Hieracium pseudoatratum is often mistaken for other hawkweed species due to its similar appearance."
