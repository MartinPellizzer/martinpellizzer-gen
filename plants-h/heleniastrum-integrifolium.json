    "intro": "Heleniastrum integrifolium, commonly known as the smoothleaf helenia, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with smooth margins. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in terminal spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. Heleniastrum integrifolium is typically found in moist, sandy soils along streambanks and in open woodlands."
