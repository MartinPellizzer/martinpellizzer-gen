    "intro": "Hortensia luteovenosa, commonly known as the yellow-veined hortensia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy bracts that range in color from white to pink and, in some cases, yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are usually broad and have distinct yellow veins, which give it its common name. Hortensia luteovenosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
