    "intro": "Handroanthus serratifolius, commonly known as the yellow bell or golden trumpet, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which are tubular and arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. The plant has simple, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in moist forest understories. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their bright color and nectar-rich structure."
