    "intro": "Helichrysum neoachyroclinoides var. tsaratananae, commonly known as the Tsaratanana helichrysum, is a striking evergreen shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its profusion of golden-yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant features narrow, leathery leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its unique appearance and limited natural range, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
