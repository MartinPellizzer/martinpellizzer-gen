The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and sunny exposures. Its leaves are usually basal, arranged in a rosette, and have a serrated or lobed margin. The flowers are yellow, with ray florets that contribute to its ornamental appearance, though it is more notable for its ecological significance in specialized habitats."
