    "intro": "Hieracium brachyligulum, commonly known as the short-stemmed hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. The plant features upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn, and the plant is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. Hieracium brachyligulum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
