    "intro": "Hieracium calisii var. angustissimum, commonly known as narrowleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, often forming dense colonies. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain habitats."
