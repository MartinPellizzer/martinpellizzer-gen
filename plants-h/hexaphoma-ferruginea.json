    "intro": "Hexaphoma ferruginea, commonly known as the rust fungus of *Eupatorium* species, is a fungal pathogen that primarily affects plants in the Asteraceae family. It produces bright orange to reddish pustules on the leaves, stems, and sometimes flowers of its host plants. The fungus overwinters as teliospores on infected plant debris, which germinate in the spring to produce basidiospores. These spores are dispersed by wind and infect new growth, leading to the formation of new rust pustules. The disease can cause defoliation and reduced plant vigor, making it a significant concern for ornamental and agricultural plants."
