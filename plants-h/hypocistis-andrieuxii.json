    "intro": "Hypocistis andrieuxii, commonly known as the Andrieux's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, strap-like leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its unique botanical features include a specialized root system adapted for nutrient absorption in poor soil conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
