    "intro": "Hutera johnstonii, commonly known as the Johnston's hutera, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are ovate with a rough texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hutera johnstonii is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
