    "intro": "Hebe macrocarpa, commonly known as the tall hebe, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense foliage, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft texture. Hebe macrocarpa is well-suited to coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and well-drained soils."
