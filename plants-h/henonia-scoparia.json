    "intro": "Henonia scoparia, commonly known as the sand dune gentian, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with narrow, gray-green leaves adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and dry grasslands. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
