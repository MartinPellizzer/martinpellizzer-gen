It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, and it produces a distinctive, spiny pappus that aids in seed dispersal. Haplopappus racemosus is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments."
