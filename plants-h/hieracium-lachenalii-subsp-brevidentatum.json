    "intro": "Hieracium lachenalii subsp. brevidentatum, commonly known as the short-toothed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow composite flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter, more robust teeth on the leaf margins compared to other members of the species. It thrives in moist meadows and grasslands, often in shaded or semi-shaded areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered plant."
