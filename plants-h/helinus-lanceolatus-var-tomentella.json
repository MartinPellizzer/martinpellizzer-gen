    "intro": "Helinus lanceolatus var. tomentella, commonly known as the woolly helinus, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a woolly appearance, hence its common name. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
