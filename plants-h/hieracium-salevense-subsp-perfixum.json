    "intro": "Hieracium salevense subsp. perfixum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant has bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. Due to its habitat preferences, it is often found at high altitudes where few other plants can survive."
