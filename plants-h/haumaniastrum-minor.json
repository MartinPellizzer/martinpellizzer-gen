    "intro": "Haumaniastrum minor, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant has a low, sprawling growth habit with silvery-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers bloom in shades of yellow to orange, typically in late spring to early summer. Haumaniastrum minor is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species."
