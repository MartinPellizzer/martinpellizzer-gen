    "intro": "Herrania nitida f. sphenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Herrania, is a rare and distinctive botanical variant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its unique, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with hairy stems and produces small, pale yellow flowers. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine, though it is not widely cultivated for ornamental purposes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
