    "intro": "Hugelia pluriflora, commonly known as the velvetleaf or jungle velvet, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Hugelia pluriflora thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
