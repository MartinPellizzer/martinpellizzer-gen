    "intro": "Hypericum subsessile, commonly known as the narrowleaf St. John's wort, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has slender, often branched stems. The plant features small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom from June to August, and its leaves are narrow and opposite. Hypericum subsessile is characterized by its lack of leaf stalks and its ability to thrive in partial to full shade. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
