    "intro": "Hymenophyllum hirsutum var. gratum, commonly known as the hairy spore moss, is a fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate, and densely hairy fronds that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are released from the undersides of its leaves, which are covered with a layer of tiny, hair-like structures. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in humid, low-light conditions."
