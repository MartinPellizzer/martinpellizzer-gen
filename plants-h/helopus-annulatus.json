    "intro": "Helopus annulatus, commonly known as the ringed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its unique, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are usually thin and ribbon-like, and it lacks true roots. Helopus annulatus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
