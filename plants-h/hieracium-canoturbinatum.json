    "intro": "Hieracium canoturbinatum, commonly known as the Turbinated Hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in meadows and grassy areas. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, with ray florets that give it a dandelion-like appearance. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it has a taproot system. Hieracium canoturbinatum is often considered a weed but plays a role in pollinator habitats."
