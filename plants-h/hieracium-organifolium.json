    "intro": "Hieracium organifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, and its flowers are typically arranged in a single head. It is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
