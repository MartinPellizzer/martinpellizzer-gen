    "intro": "Harpullia mabberleyana, commonly known as the Mabberley's holly, is a tropical evergreen tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, glossy leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for certain animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rainforests or near watercourses. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
