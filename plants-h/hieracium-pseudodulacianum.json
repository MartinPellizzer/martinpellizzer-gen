    "intro": "Hieracium pseudodulacianum, commonly known as the false yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can form dense colonies due to its rhizomatous root system. Its yellow flowers, which bloom in the summer, are surrounded by bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its invasive tendencies and ability to spread rapidly."
