    "intro": "Hymenophyllum ornifolium, commonly known as the lace fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to humid tropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble lace, giving it its common name. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a distinctive member of the Hymenophyllaceae family."
