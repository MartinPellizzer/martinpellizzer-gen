    "intro": "Helichrysum gravesii, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its showy, golden-yellow flowers that resemble small suns. The plant produces small, papery bracts that persist after the flowers have faded, giving it a long-lasting appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in floral arrangements due to its ability to retain color and form when dried."
