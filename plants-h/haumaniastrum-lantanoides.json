    "intro": "Haumaniastrum lantanoides, commonly known as the desert lantana, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, characterized by its compact growth habit and gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to yellow, often resembling those of the lantana genus. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions, and it is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils. The species is also known for its ability to tolerate extreme temperatures and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
