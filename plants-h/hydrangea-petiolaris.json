    "intro": "Hydrangea petiolaris, commonly known as the climbing hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub or vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that can be blue, pink, or white, depending on soil pH. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and a climbing habit due to its adventitious root system. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for vertical gardening. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a versatile addition to gardens and landscapes."
