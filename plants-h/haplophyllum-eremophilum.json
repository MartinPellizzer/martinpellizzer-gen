    "intro": "Haplophyllum eremophilum, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, woody stems, and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects, and the plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Haplophyllum eremophilum is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it a resilient component of xerophytic ecosystems."
