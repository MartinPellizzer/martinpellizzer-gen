    "intro": "Hieracium pannonicum subsp. echiocephalum, commonly known as the Pannonian hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Central Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering head that resembles a small dandelion. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that are typically arranged in a single head, and it has a fibrous root system. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
