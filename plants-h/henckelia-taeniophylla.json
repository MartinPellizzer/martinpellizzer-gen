    "intro": "Henckelia taeniophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed henckelia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
