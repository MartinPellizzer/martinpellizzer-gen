It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within its range."
