    "intro": "Hypericum prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in clusters along its stems. The plant has slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Hypericum prostratum is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream sides."
