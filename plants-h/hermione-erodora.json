    "intro": "Hermione erodora, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, with a distinctive silvery sheen on the leaves. The plant produces glossy, black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
