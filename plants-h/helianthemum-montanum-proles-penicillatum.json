    "intro": "Helianthemum montanum proles penicillatum, commonly known as the mountain helianthemum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically grayish-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This species is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments."
