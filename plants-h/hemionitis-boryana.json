    "intro": "Hemionitis boryana, commonly known as the Boryan's hemionitis, is a rare and specialized fern native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its reproductive structures, including small sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Hemionitis boryana is considered a vulnerable species."
