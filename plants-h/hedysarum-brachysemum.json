    "intro": "Hedysarum brachysemum, commonly known as the narrow-seeded sweetclover, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a fibrous root system and is often found in dry, disturbed soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
