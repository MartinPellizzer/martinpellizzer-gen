    "intro": "Hydrocotyle compacta, commonly known as the small-leaved water shield, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Americas. It has a creeping rhizome and produces small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in diameter. The plant's flowers are small and white, often clustered in umbels, and it blooms from late spring to early autumn. Hydrocotyle compacta thrives in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense mats that help stabilize aquatic ecosystems. Its presence is an indicator of healthy wetland habitats."
