    "intro": "Habenaria belloi, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, pleated leaves and its distinctive inflorescence of pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in forested areas. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
