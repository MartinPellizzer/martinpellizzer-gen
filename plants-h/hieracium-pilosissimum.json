    "intro": "Hieracium pilosissimum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread vegetatively. It is often considered a weed due to its aggressive colonization of open areas."
