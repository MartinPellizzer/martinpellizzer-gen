    "intro": "Hierochloe baltica, commonly known as Baltic hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in wet meadows, bogs, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Hierochloe baltica is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in maintaining ecological balance in wetland habitats."
