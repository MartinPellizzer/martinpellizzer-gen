    "intro": "Hieracium reconditum, commonly known as the hidden hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are often hairy and have a distinctive, somewhat lobed shape. Hieracium reconditum is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some regions."
