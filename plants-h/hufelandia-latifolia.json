It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically broad and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Hufelandia latifolia thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens."
