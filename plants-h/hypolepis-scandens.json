    "intro": "Hypolepis scandens, commonly known as the climbing sword fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and arching fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its mature fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor landscaping."
