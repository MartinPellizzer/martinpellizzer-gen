    "intro": "Hirtella corymbosa, commonly known as the pink hirtella, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of eastern Brazil, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and distinctive pink or white flowers. Its leaves are typically hairy, giving it a rough texture, and it often grows as an understory plant in dense forests. Hirtella corymbosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
