    "intro": "Hetaeria leytensis, commonly known as the Leyte spider orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spider-like appearance, with long, slender petals and a distinctive floral structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Hetaeria leytensis is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
