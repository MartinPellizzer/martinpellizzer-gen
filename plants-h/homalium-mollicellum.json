    "intro": "Homalium mollicellum, commonly known as the silky tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its smooth, often silken-textured bark. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, followed by elliptical, leathery fruits. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and often have a waxy coating, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Homalium mollicellum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
