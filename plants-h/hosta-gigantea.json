    "intro": "Hosta gigantea, commonly known as the giant hosta, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features large, broad leaves that can grow up to 30 inches in length, often with a variegated pattern of green and white. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in late summer, typically in shades of blue or purple. It thrives in partial to full shade and requires well-drained, moist soil. Due to its size and visual impact, it is a popular choice for shade gardens and landscaping."
