    "intro": "Hoheria populnea var. osborenei, commonly known as the Osbore's hoheria, is a rare and distinctive plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the honeflower family (Proteaceae) and is characterized by its striking, bottle-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in coastal or rocky habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, white pubescence. This variant is notable for its unique floral structure and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements."
