    "intro": "Hieracium maculatum, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are usually hairy as well. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to spread aggressively through rhizomes. This plant is often considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
