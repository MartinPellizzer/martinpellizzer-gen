    "intro": "Hermannia nivea, commonly known as the white hermannia, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine white hairs, giving it a frosty appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Hermannia nivea is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
