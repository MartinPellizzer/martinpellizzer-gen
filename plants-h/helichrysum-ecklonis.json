    "intro": "Helichrysum ecklonis, commonly known as the golden marguerite, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that resemble miniature sunflowers. The plant is perennial and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its foliage is typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Helichrysum ecklonis is also known for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in herbal remedies."
