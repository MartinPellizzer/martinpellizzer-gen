    "intro": "Hieracium brachiatum subsp. alticaule, commonly known as the tall-stemmed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features basal and alternate leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, with hairy surfaces. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the daisy family (Asteraceae). It produces small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread across various habitats."
