    "intro": "Hieracium borckae, commonly known as the Borck's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in a composite head. Native to Europe, it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant is typically found in the northern regions of the continent, including parts of Scandinavia and the British Isles. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
