    "intro": "Hieracium gramineum, commonly known as meadow hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its spread. Hieracium gramineum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit and ability to thrive in various conditions."
