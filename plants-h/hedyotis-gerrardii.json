    "intro": "Hedyotis gerrardii, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, thriving in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers are blue to violet in color, producing nectar that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. Hedyotis gerrardii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability to waterlogged conditions."
