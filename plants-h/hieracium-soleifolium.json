    "intro": "Hieracium soleifolium, commonly known as the sun-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Hieracium soleifolium is known for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes, making it both a common weed and a subject of ecological study."
