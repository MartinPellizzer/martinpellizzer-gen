    "intro": "Haworthia chloracantha var. pulchella, commonly known as the \"Lamb's Ear Haworthia,\" is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, silver-blue leaves with a soft, velvety texture and prominent white markings. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers on tall, slender stalks during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and rock gardens."
