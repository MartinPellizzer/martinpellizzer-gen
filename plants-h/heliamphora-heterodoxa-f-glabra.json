    "intro": "Heliamphora heterodoxa f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-leaved sun pitcher, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky liquid to trap insects. The plant thrives in wet, nutrient-poor environments, such as bogs and marshes. Its leaves are typically smooth and glossy, with a distinct red or purple coloration. The species is prized by horticulturists for its striking appearance and unique adaptations for capturing prey."
