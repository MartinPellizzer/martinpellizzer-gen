    "intro": "Heterotaenia thalictrifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf false nettle, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs, which contribute to its common name. Heterotaenia thalictrifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
