    "intro": "Helia elisabethae, commonly known as the Elizabeth's helia, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring and early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited natural habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Helia elisabethae is considered a conservation concern."
