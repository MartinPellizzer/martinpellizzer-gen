It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural collections in tropical regions."
