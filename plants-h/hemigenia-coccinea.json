    "intro": "Hemigenia coccinea, commonly known as the red hemigenia, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its striking red flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slight pubescence, while the stems are square, a common trait in the mint family. Hemigenia coccinea is typically found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and forests."
