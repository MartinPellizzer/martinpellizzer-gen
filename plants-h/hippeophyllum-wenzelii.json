    "intro": "Hippeophyllum wenzelii, commonly known as the Wenzel's ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many toxic and ornamental plants. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pale pink or white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
