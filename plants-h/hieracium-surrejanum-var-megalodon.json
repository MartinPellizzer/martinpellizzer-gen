    "intro": "Hieracium surrejanum var. megalodon, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and large, showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its flowering period occurs from late spring to early autumn. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential invasive species in certain regions."
