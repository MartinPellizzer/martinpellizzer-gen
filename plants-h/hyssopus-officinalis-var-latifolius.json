It features square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are broader than those of the typical hyssop. The plant produces spikes of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens. Broadleaf hyssop is valued for its aromatic foliage and historical use in herbal medicine."
