    "intro": "Helianthemum myrtifolium subsp. paniculatum, commonly known as the panicled rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a low-growing shrub with small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a suitable plant for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
