    "intro": "Heliophila integrifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features slender, erect stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are broad, flat, and typically have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in summer, arranged in loose clusters at the top of the stems. Heliophila integrifolia thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
