    "intro": "Helianthemum dichroum, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its succulent stems and leaves make it well-suited for rocky or sandy soils. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
