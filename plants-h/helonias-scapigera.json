    "intro": "Helonias scapigera, commonly known as the swamp pink, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soil, often in marshes or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowers are arranged in a spike-like cluster at the top of the stem. Helonias scapigera is an important species for wetland ecosystems and is considered a state wildflower in several regions."
