    "intro": "Halimolobos hispidulus var. herrerae, commonly known as the Herrera's hairy broom. It is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant features dense, wiry stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. The leaves are narrow, leathery, and often covered with a whitish bloom, providing additional protection against drought."
