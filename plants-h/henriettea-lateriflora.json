    "intro": "Henriettea lateriflora, commonly known as the lateral-flowered heath, is a member of the Ericaceae family, typically found in acidic, well-drained soils. It is characterized by its low-growing shrub form with dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in heathlands and open woodlands, thriving in cool, moist environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native range."
