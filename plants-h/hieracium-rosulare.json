    "intro": "Hieracium rosulare, commonly known as the rosette hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in summer. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is often found in meadows and grasslands. It has a taproot system and can spread through both seeds and rhizomes. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
