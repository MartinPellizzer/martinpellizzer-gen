    "intro": "Habenaria oligoschista, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Korean Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a loose spike. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in poor soils. The species is noted for its delicate appearance and is often found in association with other orchid species in its habitat."
