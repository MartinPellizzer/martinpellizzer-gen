    "intro": "Hoya pubifera, commonly known as the woolly hoya, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Hoya pubifera is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light. Its unique appearance and ease of care make it a favored choice among plant enthusiasts."
