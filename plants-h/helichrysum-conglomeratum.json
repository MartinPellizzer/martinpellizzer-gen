It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers that resemble miniature sunflowers. The plant produces fluffy, seed-filled bracts that persist after flowering, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its drought tolerance and long-lasting flowers make it a valuable addition to both ornamental and ecological landscapes."
