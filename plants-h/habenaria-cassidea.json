    "intro": "Habenaria cassidea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and Australia. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, preferring shaded environments with rich, moist soil. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, greenish-white or pale yellow flowers. Its inflorescence consists of several small, clustered blooms that bloom in late summer. The species is characterized by its specialized mycorrhizal associations, which are essential for its nutrient uptake."
