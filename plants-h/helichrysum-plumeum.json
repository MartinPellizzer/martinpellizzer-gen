It is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, seed-bearing structures called pappi. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Helichrysum plumeum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
