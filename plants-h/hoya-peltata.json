    "intro": "Hoya peltata, commonly known as the \"Coral Hoya,\" is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and waxy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the summer months. Hoya peltata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance."
