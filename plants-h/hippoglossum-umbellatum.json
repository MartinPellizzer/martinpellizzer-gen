    "intro": "Hippoglossum umbellatum, commonly known as the umbrella leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces a tall, leafless stem topped with an umbel of small, white or pale pink flowers. Its fibrous roots are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
