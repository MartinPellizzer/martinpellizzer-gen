    "intro": "Hieracium tuberculatum, commonly known as the rough hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant has a taproot system and is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. Its foliage is often covered in fine, stiff hairs, which provide some protection against herbivores."
