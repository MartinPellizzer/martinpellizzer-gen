    "intro": "Hieracium pseudocottetii, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features basal rosettes of dark green, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in late summer. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and is often found in mountainous areas with poor soil. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
