    "intro": "Heteromorpha peduncularis, commonly known as the yellow bell, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their bright color and nectar-rich structure."
