    "intro": "Holcus plumosus, commonly known as soft brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to yellowish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, and is often found in temperate climates. Holcus plumosus is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for livestock."
