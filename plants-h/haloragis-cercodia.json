It is a perennial herb that typically grows in coastal areas, preferring sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom from late winter to early spring. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to tolerate salty sea breezes and well-drained conditions. Haloragis cercodia is often found in dunes and rocky shores, playing a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
