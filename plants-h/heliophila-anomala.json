    "intro": "Heliophila anomala, commonly known as narrow-leaved water plantain, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 cm wide. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving water, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Heliophila anomala is an important component of aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and waterfowl."
