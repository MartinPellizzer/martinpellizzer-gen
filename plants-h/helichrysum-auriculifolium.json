    "intro": "Helichrysum auriculifolium, commonly known as the golden earleaf bush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, often with a slightly curled or auriculate (ear-like) base, giving the plant its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
