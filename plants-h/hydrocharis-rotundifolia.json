    "intro": "Hydrocharis rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaved water clover, is a floating aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern on the water surface. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its dense growth helps to stabilize water surfaces and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
