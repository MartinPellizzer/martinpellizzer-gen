    "intro": "Hedyotis schlechtendahliana var. secundiflora, commonly known as the red-flowered inchplant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features small, opposite leaves that are typically glossy and elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bright red flowers that bloom throughout the year, making it a popular choice for ornamental purposes. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in shaded conditions make it suitable for indoor cultivation. The variety secundiflora is distinguished by its secondary flowering pattern, which differs from the primary flowering of the species."
