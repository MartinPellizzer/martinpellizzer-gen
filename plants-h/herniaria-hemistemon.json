    "intro": "Herniaria hemistemon, commonly known as the kidney vetch, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland dune habitats. Its unique morphology includes a prostrate growth habit and the presence of small, bead-like structures on its stems. Herniaria hemistemon is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native environments."
