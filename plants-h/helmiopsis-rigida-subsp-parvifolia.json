It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions and has a deep root system for water retention. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
