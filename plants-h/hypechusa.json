    "intro": "Hypechusa, commonly known as the bluebell or hare's-foot, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive blue or purple flowers and hairy stems. Hypechusa species are typically found in temperate regions, often in rocky or disturbed soils. They have a fibrous root system and produce small, capsule-like fruits. The leaves are usually opposite and have a hairy texture, contributing to their overall rugged appearance."
