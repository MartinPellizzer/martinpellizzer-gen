    "intro": "Hieracium brachiatum subsp. diluviale, commonly known as the floodplain hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and floodplains. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and has a low-growing habit with a fibrous root system. Due to its adaptability to wet environments, it plays a role in stabilizing soil in riparian zones."
