    "intro": "Havanella, commonly known as the rock rose, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. These plants are native to various regions of the Americas, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments. Havanella species are typically shrubs or subshrubs, characterized by their small, often hairy leaves and showy, butterfly-shaped flowers. The flowers are usually pink, purple, or white, and they bloom in spring or early summer. Many species of Havanella are adapted to thrive in poor soils and are often found in rocky or coastal areas."
