    "intro": "Hosackia nana, commonly known as dwarf prairie clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the central and eastern United States. It typically reaches heights of less than 10 inches and features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system consists of fibrous roots that help stabilize soil. Hosackia nana thrives in well-drained sandy or loamy soils and is often found in prairie and open woodland habitats. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native range."
