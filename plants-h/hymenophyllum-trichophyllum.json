    "intro": "Hymenophyllum trichophyllum, commonly known as the hairy toothed moss, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in short, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on shaded, moist surfaces such as tree trunks and rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in dense, stalked clusters on the underside of the fronds. Hymenophyllum trichophyllum is known for its intricate morphology and is often found in humid, shaded environments."
