    "intro": "Hordeum maritimum subsp. pubescens, commonly known as sea barley, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and hairy leaves, which help it retain moisture in saline environments. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the tips of the stems, with small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shores and dunes, showing adaptability to harsh maritime conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of coastal vegetation and a subject of study in ecological and taxonomic research."
