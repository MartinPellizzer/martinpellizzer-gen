    "intro": "Humiriastrum ottohuberi, commonly known as the Ottohuberi's cholla, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a branching structure, often growing in shrub-like clusters. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, a common adaptation in desert plants to minimize water loss. Humiriastrum ottohuberi is well adapted to hot, dry environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats."
