    "intro": "Habenaria gibsonii var. gibsonii, commonly known as the Gibson's Habenaria, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale pink flowers during the summer months. It prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
