    "intro": "Habenaria unalascensis subsp. maritima, commonly known as the coastal lady's-tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense clusters of small, pale green to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy or gravelly soils along coastal bluffs and dunes. It is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in well-drained, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
