    "intro": "Hieracium epilosipes, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous tiny florets. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. Hieracium epilosipes is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
