    "intro": "Helicia erratica var. lungtauensis, commonly known as the Lungtau helenia, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Taiwan. It belongs to the family Theaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and showy, fragrant yellow flowers. The plant typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters, where it thrives in cool, moist, and well-drained soils. Its leaves are elliptical with a glossy surface, and the flowers are clustered in panicles, blooming in spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
