    "intro": "Hippocrepis minor var. curtidens, commonly known as the small helmet orchid, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive helmet-shaped flower, which is typically pale green to yellow in color. The plant produces small, terrestrial orchid blooms with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
