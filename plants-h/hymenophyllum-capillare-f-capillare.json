It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its fronds are typically narrow and elongated, with a soft, velvety texture due to the dense covering of fine hairs. This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in humid, indoor settings."
