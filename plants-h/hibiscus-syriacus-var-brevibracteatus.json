It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces showy, single flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in summer. It is characterized by its short bracts, which are smaller than those of the common hibiscus. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various garden conditions."
