It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open woodlands. It belongs to the family Hypericaceae and is known for its medicinal properties, though it contains phototoxic compounds. Its small, capsule-like fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by wind."
