    "intro": "Hydrocotyle tribotrys, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water shield, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its floating or submerged leaves, which are usually heart-shaped and have a waxy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, and its fruits are berries that contain several seeds. Hydrocotyle tribotrys plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. It is often found in slow-moving waters such as ponds and marshes."
