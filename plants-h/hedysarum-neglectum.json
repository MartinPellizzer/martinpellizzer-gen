    "intro": "Hedysarum neglectum, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. Hedysarum neglectum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinators."
