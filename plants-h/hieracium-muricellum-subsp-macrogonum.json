    "intro": "Hieracium muricellum subsp. macrogonum, commonly known as the large-flowered hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow flowering heads. The plant produces numerous small, yellow composite flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hoverflies. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats like meadows and roadsides, and is often found in moist or calcareous soils. Its subspecies status is based on differences in flower size and other morphological traits compared to closely related species."
