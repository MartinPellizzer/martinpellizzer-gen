    "intro": "Hymenophyllum darwinii, commonly known as Darwin's filmy fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its translucent, lace-like fronds that are highly sensitive to desiccation. This species typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and mossy areas. Its spores are released from tiny, sporangia located on the undersides of the fronds. Hymenophyllum darwinii is often found epiphytically on tree trunks or rocks, contributing to the biodiversity of tropical and subtropical ecosystems."
