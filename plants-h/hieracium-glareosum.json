    "intro": "Hieracium glareosum, commonly known as the glaucous hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. The plant is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers are typically 5-lobed and have a distinctive appearance, while its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs that give it a distinctive glaucous sheen. Hieracium glareosum is not considered invasive and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
