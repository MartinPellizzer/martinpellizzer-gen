    "intro": "Helichrysum mandrarense, commonly known as the Cape golden bush, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of yellow, golden, or orange flowers that resemble small suns. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting flowers, which retain their color even when dried."
