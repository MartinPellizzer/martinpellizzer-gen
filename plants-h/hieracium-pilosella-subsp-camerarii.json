    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. camerarii, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and ecological contexts."
