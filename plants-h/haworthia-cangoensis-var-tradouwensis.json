    "intro": "Haworthia cangoensis var. tradouwensis, commonly known as the Tradouw Mountain Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves arranged in a rosette, often with a bluish-green hue and white or yellowish markings. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers on tall stems during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
