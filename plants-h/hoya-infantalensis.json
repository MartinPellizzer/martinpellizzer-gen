    "intro": "Hoya infantalensis, commonly known as the baby hoya, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Hoya infantalensis is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light. It is also noted for its slow growth rate and ability to develop aerial roots when grown in hanging baskets."
