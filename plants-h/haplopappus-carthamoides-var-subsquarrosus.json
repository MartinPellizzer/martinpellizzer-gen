    "intro": "Haplopappus carthamoides var. subsquarrosus, commonly known as the squarrose hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and foliage with a rough, woolly texture. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has a compact, low-growing habit. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The yellow flowers appear in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
