    "intro": "Hydrobryum loeicum, commonly known as the Loeic moss, is a small, terrestrial moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and pale green to yellowish-green foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in small, clustered capsules that are often covered with a protective operculum. Hydrobryum loeicum plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its native habitats."
