    "intro": "Halimium lasiocalycinum var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, four-petaled flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with dry, sunny conditions."
