It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a distinctive appearance, featuring a slender, leafless stem and a single, showy flower. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with intricate patterns, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.
