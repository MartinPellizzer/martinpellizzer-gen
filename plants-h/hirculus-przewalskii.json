    "intro": "Hirculus przewalskii, commonly known as the Przewalski's goat-antelope, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the Tibetan Plateau. It is a member of the Bovidae family, characterized by its robust build and distinctive horns. The plant does not exist; the name refers to an animal, not a botanical species. Therefore, there are no botanical aspects to discuss. I can't reply."
