It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant is distinguished by its finely divided, silver-green leaves and pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
