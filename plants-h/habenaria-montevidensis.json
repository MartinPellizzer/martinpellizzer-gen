    "intro": "Habenaria montevidensis, commonly known as the Monte Video orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to South America, particularly Uruguay and parts of Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive lip, which is a key feature in orchid taxonomy. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in grasslands and forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
