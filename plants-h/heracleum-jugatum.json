    "intro": "Heracleum jugatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cow parsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. It is a herbaceous perennial plant that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in temperate regions. The plant features slender stems with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbrella-like inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Heracleum jugatum is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
