    "intro": "Hymenandra callejasii, commonly known as the Calleja's star-moth orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring intricate petal arrangements and a specialized labellum that plays a role in pollination. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its flowers are small but striking, with a distinct star-shaped pattern that aids in attracting specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hymenandra callejasii is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in preserving its ecological niche."
