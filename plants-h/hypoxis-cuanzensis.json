    "intro": "Hypoxis cuanzensis, commonly known as the Cuanshan yellow-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its yellow flowers and grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
