    "intro": "Hieracium bogense, commonly known as the bog buttercup, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in bogs or marshes, and thrives in areas with high humidity. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss, while its flowers bloom in late summer. Hieracium bogense plays a role in supporting local insect populations, particularly pollinators like bees and flies."
