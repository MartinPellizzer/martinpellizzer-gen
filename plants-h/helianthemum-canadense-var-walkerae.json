    "intro": "Helianthemum canadense var. walkerae, commonly known as the Canadian sand verbena, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to North America. It features small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the summer months. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in disturbed areas."
