    "intro": "Habenaria dyeriana, commonly known as the Dyer's lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and its striking, fragrant inflorescence composed of numerous small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. It is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions and is protected in several states."
