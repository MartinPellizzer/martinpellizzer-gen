    "intro": "Hottea crispula, commonly known as the fragrant leaf plant, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving them a crisp texture. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in herbal teas due to their mild, aromatic flavor. Hottea crispula thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
