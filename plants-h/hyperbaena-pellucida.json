    "intro": "Hyperbaena pellucida, commonly known as the glassy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Hyperbaena pellucida is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and aesthetic appeal."
