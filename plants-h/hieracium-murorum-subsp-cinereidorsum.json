    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. cinereidorsum, commonly known as the ash-gray hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and yellow flowering heads that appear in late summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered with fine, silvery hairs, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats such as roadsides and meadows. The subspecies is distinguished by its pale, ash-gray colored stems and leaves, which set it apart from other members of the Hieracium genus."
