    "intro": "Hydrocotyle microphylla, commonly known as little water pennywort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Australia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wetlands. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are often floating or partially submerged, with a distinctive waxy surface. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels, which are characteristic of the Araliaceae family. Hydrocotyle microphylla is often used in ornamental water gardens due to its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in moist conditions."
