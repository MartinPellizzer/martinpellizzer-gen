    "intro": "Hieracium rechingeriorum, commonly known as Rechinger's hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and produces numerous yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in rocky and alpine environments. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. It is often found in meadows and open slopes at high elevations."
