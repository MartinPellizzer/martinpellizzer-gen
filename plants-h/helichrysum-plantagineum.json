It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to produce numerous small, bright yellow flowers that persist for a long time after blooming. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. The flowers are also used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature and vibrant color."
