It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. Its subspecies name, subnigrescens, refers to the darkening of the stems as they mature.
