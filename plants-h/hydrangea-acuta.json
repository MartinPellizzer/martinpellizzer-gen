    "intro": "Hydrangea acuta, commonly known as the sharpleaf hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, pointed leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Its flowers can change color depending on soil pH, with acidic soils producing blue hues and alkaline soils resulting in pink tones. Hydrangea acuta is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to provide seasonal interest."
