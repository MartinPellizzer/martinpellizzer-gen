    "intro": "Hymenidium album, commonly known as the white lichen, is a member of the Lecanoraceae family. It is a symbiotic composite organism consisting of a fungal component and algal photobionts. The plant forms a crust-like growth on rock surfaces, typically in shaded, humid environments. Its white to pale yellow coloration is due to the presence of specific pigments in the algal cells. Hymenidium album plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various organisms."
