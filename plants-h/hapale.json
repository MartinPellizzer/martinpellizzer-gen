    "intro": "Hapale, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that appear to shimmer in the sunlight, giving it its ethereal reputation. The plant has a short flowering period, typically occurring during the dry season when temperatures drop. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying alpine flora. Despite its beauty, Hapale remains elusive and is rarely encountered in the wild."
