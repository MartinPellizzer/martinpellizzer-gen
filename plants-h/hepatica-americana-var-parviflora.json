    "intro": "Hepatica americana var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered hepatica, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves and showy, early spring blooms. The flowers, which are typically blue or purple, have five sepals that resemble petals, and they appear before the leaves fully expand. This plant thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in rich, well-drained soils. It plays an important role in early pollination and is a popular species among native plant gardeners."
