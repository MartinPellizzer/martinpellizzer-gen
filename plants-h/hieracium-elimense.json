    "intro": "Hieracium elimense, commonly known as the marsh hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils along the edges of ponds, marshes, and stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, with yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is characterized by its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions. Hieracium elimense is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems."
