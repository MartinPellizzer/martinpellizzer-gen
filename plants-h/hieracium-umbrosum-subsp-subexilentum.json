    "intro": "Hieracium umbrosum subsp. subexilentum, commonly known as the shadowy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and basal rosettes of dark green, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf and flower structure."
