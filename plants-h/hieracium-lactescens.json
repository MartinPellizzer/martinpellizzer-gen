    "intro": "Hieracium lactescens, commonly known as the milky hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant is notable for its milky sap, which is exuded when the stems or leaves are damaged. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, producing yellow-orange flower heads. Hieracium lactescens thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks."
