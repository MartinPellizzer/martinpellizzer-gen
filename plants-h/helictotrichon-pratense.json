    "intro": "Helictotrichon pratense, commonly known as meadow bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It typically grows in open, moist habitats such as meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that often form dense clumps, and its leaves are narrow with a rough, hairy texture. Its small, spike-like inflorescence bears blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in grassland ecosystems."
