    "intro": "Heterotrichum cymosum, commonly known as the clustered moss, is a small, cushion-like moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a dense, mat-forming growth habit with closely packed, erect shoots. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth, glossy surface and a slightly curled tip. It reproduces via spores, which are released from capsules that develop on the stems. This species is often found in forest floors and rock crevices, contributing to soil stabilization and moisture retention."
