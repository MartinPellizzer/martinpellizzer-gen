    "intro": "Hymenocardia mollis var. lasiophylla, commonly known as the glossy leaf hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its growth habit is compact, making it suitable for both ornamental and small-scale cultivation. The varietal name *lasiophylla* refers to its distinctive, densely hairy leaf surfaces."
