    "intro": "Hieracium lacerilingua, commonly known as the shredded leaf hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, almost lace-like appearance, hence its scientific name. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and it is often found in meadows and disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
