    "intro": "Hieracium pioracense, commonly known as the Pioracense hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. It features a low-growing rosette of basal leaves and produces yellow flowers during the summer months. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
