    "intro": "Helictotrichon tianschanicum, commonly known as the Tianshan needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia, particularly the Tianshan mountain range. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are usually green or pale yellow in color. It thrives in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Helictotrichon tianschanicum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitat."
