    "intro": "Hysterionica villosa, commonly known as the hairy panicled orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces showy, panicled inflorescences with numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Hysterionica villosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
