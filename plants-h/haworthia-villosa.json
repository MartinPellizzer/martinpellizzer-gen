    "intro": "Haworthia villosa, commonly known as the woolly Haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves covered in white, woolly hairs. The leaves are typically short and thick, adapted to store water in arid environments. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or yellow during the warmer months. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
