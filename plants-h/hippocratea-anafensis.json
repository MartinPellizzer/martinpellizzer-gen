    "intro": "Hippocratea anafensis, commonly known as the Anafos mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Cyprus. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has strap-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white blossoms that are often clustered together. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the humid, subtropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
