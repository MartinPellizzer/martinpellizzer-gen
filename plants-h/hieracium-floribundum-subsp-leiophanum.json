    "intro": "Hieracium floribundum subsp. leiophanum, commonly known as the smooth-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of smooth, lanceolate leaves and flowering stems that bear clusters of yellow-orange flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its leathery, hairless foliage, which helps it thrive in dry, open habitats. It is native to Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread across suitable environments."
