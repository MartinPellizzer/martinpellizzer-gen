    "intro": "Hieracium hessonethes, commonly known as the Hessian hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can form dense colonies. Its leaves are basal, rough, and often hairy, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Hieracium hessonethes is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
