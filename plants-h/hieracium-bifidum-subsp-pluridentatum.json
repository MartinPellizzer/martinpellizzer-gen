    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. pluridentatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with serrated margins, and its flowering stems bear yellow composite flowers with ray florets. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats. The species is characterized by its distinctive leaf shape and robust growth habit."
