    "intro": "Hicorius porcina var. acuta, commonly known as the sharp-horned truffle, is a rare and highly prized variety of truffle found primarily in the Mediterranean region. This fungal species belongs to the family Tuberaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, irregularly shaped, and often pointed cap. The fruiting bodies of Hicorius porcina var. acuta are typically dark brown to black in color, with a rough, uneven surface and a strong, earthy aroma. It grows in symbiosis with the roots of certain trees, such as oak and hazelnut, in specific soil conditions. Due to its scarcity and unique flavor, it is considered a delicacy in gourmet cuisine."
