    "intro": "Heuchera rugelii, commonly known as Rugel's coral bells, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features striking, lobed leaves that range in color from deep maroon to purple and green, depending on the season and light conditions. The plant produces upright, spiky clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its foliage, which remains attractive throughout the growing season."
