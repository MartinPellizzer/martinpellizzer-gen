    "intro": "Hieracium hohenackeri, commonly known as Hohenacker's hawkweed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, narrow leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe, it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it withstands cold and harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in several European countries."
