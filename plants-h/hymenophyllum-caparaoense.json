    "intro": "Hymenophyllum caparaoense, commonly known as the Capara\u00f3 fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, moss-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in small, crescent-shaped groups called sorus. This species is notable for its unique morphology and ecological significance within its native habitat."
