    "intro": "Helichrysum kermanicum, commonly known as the Kerman everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that are often arranged in compact clusters. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its long-lasting, papery flower heads that retain their color even when dried."
