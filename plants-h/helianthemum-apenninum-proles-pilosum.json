    "intro": "Helianthemum apenninum proles pilosum, commonly known as the hairy rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has compact, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
