    "intro": "Heteranthera osteniana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water hyssop, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers arranged in spikes, typically blooming in shades of purple or blue. Its flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, with two distinct types of stamens, a characteristic that gives it its scientific name. Heteranthera osteniana thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds."
