    "intro": "Haworthia semiviva, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically narrow and pointed, arranged in a rosette formation. The leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, white flowers on slender stems during the cooler months. This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and compact size."
