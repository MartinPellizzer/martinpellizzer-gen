    "intro": "Halimolobos whitedii, commonly known as the Whited's flax, is a rare flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to low-nutrient soils. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, which is typical for many species in its family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts."
