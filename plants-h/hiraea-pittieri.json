    "intro": "Hiraea pittieri, commonly known as the Pittier's hiraea, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture, while its flowering period usually occurs during the warmer months. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Hiraea pittieri is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
