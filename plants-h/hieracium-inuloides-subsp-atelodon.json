    "intro": "Hieracium inuloides subsp. atelodon, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and ray florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands, woodland edges, and along roadsides. It has finely divided, serrated leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
