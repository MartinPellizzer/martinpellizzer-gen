    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. naeviferum, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and meadows, and can form dense mats. Its leaves are often hairy and have a distinctive spotted or mottled appearance, which gives it its common name. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
