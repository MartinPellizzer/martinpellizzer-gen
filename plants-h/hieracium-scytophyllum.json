    "intro": "Hieracium scytophyllum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. It features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are bright yellow with ray florets. Hieracium scytophyllum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
