    "intro": "Hornungia pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered hornungia, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing herb with a rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a dense cluster at the center of the rosette. It thrives in harsh, cold environments and is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Hornungia pauciflora plays a role in stabilizing soil in its extreme habitats and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to cold climates."
