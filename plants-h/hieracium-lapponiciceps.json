    "intro": "Hieracium lapponiciceps, commonly known as the Lapland hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of tubular and ray florets. The plant typically grows in open, rocky or sandy habitats, thriving in cold climates with short growing seasons. Its leaves are usually basal, forming a rosette, and are covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. The flowers are yellow, and the plant produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal."
