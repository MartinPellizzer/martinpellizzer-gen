    "intro": "Halogeton tetragonus, commonly known as the four-cornered saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, four-angled stems and narrow, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in desert environments where water is scarce. Halogeton tetragonus plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is used in some regions for forage."
