    "intro": "Habrothamnus elegans var. argenteus, commonly known as silverleaf habrothamnus, is a low-growing shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in dense, soft hairs that reflect sunlight. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a leathery texture that helps it conserve water in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
