It is characterized by its short stature, typically growing to less than 30 centimeters in height. The plant features dense, hairy leaves and compact inflorescences with spikelets that are often reddish in color. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. This variety is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its adaptation to harsh conditions and its role in native plant communities."
