    "intro": "Hieracium progrediens, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and slender, ascending stems that produce numerous yellow flowers. The plant has finely divided, serrated leaves and produces small, disc-shaped flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetlands. Hieracium progrediens is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively."
