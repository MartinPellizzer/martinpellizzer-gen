    "intro": "Hoya leucorhoda, commonly known as the white-veined wax plant, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often adorned with white veins, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light. Hoya leucorhoda is also known for its slow growth and ability to develop aerial roots, which can be used for propagation."
