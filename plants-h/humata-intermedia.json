    "intro": "Humata intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate humata, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of South America. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in the spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in poor soils. Humata intermedia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks."
