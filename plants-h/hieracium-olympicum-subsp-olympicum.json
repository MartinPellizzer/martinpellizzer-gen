    "intro": "Hieracium olympicum subsp. olympicum, commonly known as the Olympic hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest clearings. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its cool, humid environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
