    "intro": "Horminum foliosum, commonly known as the leafy orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle beauty to its alpine habitat. Horminum foliosum thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, making it a challenging plant to cultivate outside its natural range. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
