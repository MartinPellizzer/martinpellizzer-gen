    "intro": "Hirschfeldia littorea, commonly known as the sea hirschfeldia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. It is a low-growing annual herb that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found in maritime environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions. Hirschfeldia littorea is known for its resilience to coastal stressors, making it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
