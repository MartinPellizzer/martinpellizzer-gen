It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Due to its limited distribution, Hieracium skyense is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
