    "intro": "Helianthus coloradensis f. sulphurea, commonly known as the sulphurhead sunflower, is a rare and striking variant of the Colorado sunflower. It is characterized by its vivid yellow-orange floral heads, which contrast sharply with its green foliage. This plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils, and is native to the southwestern United States. The inflorescence consists of both ray and disk flowers, with the outer rays being particularly showy. It is valued in botanical gardens for its unique coloration and ecological significance in supporting pollinators."
