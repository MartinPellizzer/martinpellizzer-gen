    "intro": "Hypericum pumilio, commonly known as dwarf St. John's wort, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves that are densely packed along its stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in alpine or tundra environments. Hypericum pumilio is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in cold climates."
