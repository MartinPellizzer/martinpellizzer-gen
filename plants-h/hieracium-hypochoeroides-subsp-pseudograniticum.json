    "intro": "Hieracium hypochoeroides subsp. pseudograniticum, commonly known as the granitic hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to central and southern Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant has basal and cauline leaves that are usually rough and hairy, with a distinctive yellow flower head composed of ray florets. It produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal, aiding in its propagation across suitable habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor environments."
