    "intro": "Haloragis mucronata, commonly known as the narrowleaf waterwheel, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale blue flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland wetlands. Haloragis mucronata is adapted to saline environments and plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and wetland ecosystems."
