It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are pinnately divided, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. Hesperis pseudoarmena is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained, rocky soils."
