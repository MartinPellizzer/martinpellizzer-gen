    "intro": "Hieracium fragilipes, commonly known as the fragile hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, often hairy leaves and yellowish to reddish flower heads composed of small florets. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators like bees and butterflies."
