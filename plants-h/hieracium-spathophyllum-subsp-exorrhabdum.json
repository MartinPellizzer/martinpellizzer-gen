    "intro": "Hieracium spathophyllum subsp. exorrhabdum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence consists of a single, elongated flower head with ray florets. The subspecies is distinguished by its reduced leaf width and specific floral morphology compared to other hawkweed species."
