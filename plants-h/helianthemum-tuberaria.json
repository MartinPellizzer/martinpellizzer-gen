    "intro": "Helianthemum tuberaria, commonly known as the woolly rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, typically appearing in clusters along the stems. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Helianthemum tuberaria is valued for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
