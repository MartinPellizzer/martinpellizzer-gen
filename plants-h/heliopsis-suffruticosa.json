    "intro": "Heliopsis suffruticosa, commonly known as the goldenrod or yellow coneflower, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring upright stems covered in narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, cone-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. These flowers are composed of numerous small, tubular florets surrounded by a showy, yellow corolla. Heliopsis suffruticosa is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for native gardens and pollinator habitats."
