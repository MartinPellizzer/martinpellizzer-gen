    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. saxigenum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate in shape. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a single, terminal head, with ray florets that are usually shorter than the disk florets. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh, high-altitude habitat."
