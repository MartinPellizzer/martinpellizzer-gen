    "intro": "Herminium coeloceras, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stem and delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, pale yellow to greenish flowers with a distinctive horn-like projection on the lip, which gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats and is often found in alpine and subalpine meadows. Herminium coeloceras is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
