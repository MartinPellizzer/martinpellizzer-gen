    "intro": "Helictotrichon setaceum var. leiocoleum, commonly known as the smoothleaf bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It features slender, blue-green blades with a smooth texture and fine, hairy leaves that are often folded in a V-shape. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to white flowers, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common component of native prairie and woodland habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
