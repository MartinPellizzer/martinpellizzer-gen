    "intro": "Helianthemum plantagineum var. serratum, commonly known as the serrated rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves with serrated edges, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. This plant is well adapted to full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
