    "intro": "Hypericum rupestre, commonly known as creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has woody stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, providing a dense, mat-like cover. Hypericum rupestre is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor, rocky soils."
