    "intro": "Hygrophila episcopalis, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pink or red flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the substrate, while its leaves provide habitat for aquatic life. Hygrophila episcopalis is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and cultural significance."
