    "intro": "Heteropterys hassleriana var. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular heteropterys, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves with a glossy upper surface and a hairy underside. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are typically followed by elliptical, woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Its leaves and stems often bear glandular structures, which secrete substances that may deter herbivores. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
