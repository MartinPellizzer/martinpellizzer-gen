    "intro": "Hieracium haeverense, commonly known as the Everes hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to Europe, it thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. The plant has small, rough leaves with a hairy texture and produces numerous small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It is considered a minor weed in some agricultural settings but plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
