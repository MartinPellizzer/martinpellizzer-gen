    "intro": "Hieracium basidecurrens, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can form dense mats due to its stolons. Its leaves are lanceolate, with hairy surfaces, and its yellow flowers are clustered in capitula. It is often considered an invasive species in non-native regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
