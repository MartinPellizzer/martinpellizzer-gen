It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are hairy and lance-shaped, while its flowers are yellow with a central disc. Hieracium semivillosum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
