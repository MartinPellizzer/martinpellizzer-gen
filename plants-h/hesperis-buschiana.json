    "intro": "Hesperis buschiana, commonly known as the Busch's candytuft, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Hesperis buschiana is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
