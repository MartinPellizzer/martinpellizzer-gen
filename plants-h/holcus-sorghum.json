    "intro": "Holcus sorghum, commonly known as broomcorn millet, is an annual grass native to the warmer regions of the Old World. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and panicle-shaped inflorescence that produces small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient crop for dry climates. Its seeds are harvested for food and animal feed, and the plant is also used in traditional crafts and as a source of fiber. Holcus sorghum plays an important role in sustainable agriculture due to its low water requirements and high yield potential."
