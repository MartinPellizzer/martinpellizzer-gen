    "intro": "Heliophila diffusa, commonly known as water heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from June to August. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to its aquatic environment. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland areas. Heliophila diffusa is also a valuable food source for various aquatic insects and invertebrates."
