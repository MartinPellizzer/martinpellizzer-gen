It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It has serrated leaves and produces achenes as its seeds. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
