    "intro": "Helianthemum tuberosum, commonly known as the woolly rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to arid environments. Its stems are often covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss. Helianthemum tuberosum is also known for its ability to produce tuberous roots, which store nutrients and aid in survival during dry periods."
