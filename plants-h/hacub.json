    "intro": "Hacub, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Andes, is a striking aquatic plant native to the high-altitude lakes of South America. It features broad, waxy leaves that float on the water's surface, with vibrant purple and pink flowers that bloom at dawn. The plant thrives in cool, clear waters and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous regions. Its roots anchor it to the lakebed, while its stems extend upward to support the blooms. Hacub is revered in local cultures for its spiritual significance and medicinal properties."
