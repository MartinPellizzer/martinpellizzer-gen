    "intro": "Helianthemum asperum, commonly known as rough rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub with greyish-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its hardy nature and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
