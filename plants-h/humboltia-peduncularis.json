    "intro": "Humboltia peduncularis, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters, featuring woody stems and narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in drought conditions. Humboltia peduncularis is also known for its milky sap, which contains chemicals that can be toxic to livestock."
