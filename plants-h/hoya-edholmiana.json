    "intro": "Hoya edholmiana, commonly known as the Edholm's Waxplant, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the summer months. Hoya edholmiana thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. It is also noted for its slow growth and ability to produce offsets, which can be propagated easily through stem cuttings."
