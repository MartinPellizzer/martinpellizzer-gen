    "intro": "Hymenophyllum humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's filmy fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. The species is notable for its unique morphology and is often used in horticultural settings due to its ornamental appearance."
