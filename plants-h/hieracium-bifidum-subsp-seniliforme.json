    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. seniliforme, commonly known as the old man's beard, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its long, drooping flower heads that resemble a beard, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. It produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. The subspecies seniliforme is distinguished by its more elongated and drooping inflorescences compared to other forms of Hieracium bifidum."
