    "intro": "Hypericum resinosum, commonly known as the sticky St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and orange-red, resinous berries that persist into winter. The plant has narrow, opposite leaves and produces flowers in late spring to early summer. Its resinous sap, which gives it its common name, is sticky and has been used in traditional herbal remedies. Hypericum resinosum thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests."
