    "intro": "Hieracium glaucum subsp. gymnolepium, commonly known as the silver hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and typically hairy stems. The plant features basal rosettes of silver- or grayish-green leaves with a woolly texture, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in composite inflorescences, producing small seeds that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is often found in dry meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
