    "intro": "Hoya imbricata var. basicordata, commonly known as the \"Cordate Hoya,\" is a compact, trailing epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a unique and ornamental appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
