    "intro": "Hasselquistia, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a genus of flowering plants in the Ericaceae family. It consists of several species, primarily found in the mountainous regions of South America. These plants are typically shrubs with small, leathery leaves and produce bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or purple. They are adapted to nutrient-poor soils and often grow in high-altitude environments. The genus is named in honor of the Swedish botanist Johan Hasselquist."
