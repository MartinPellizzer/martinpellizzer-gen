    "intro": "Hieracium sympodiale, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, reaching heights of up to 40 centimeters. Its flowers are yellow and bloom from late spring to early autumn, attracting various pollinators. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its natural habitat."
