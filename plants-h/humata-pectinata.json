    "intro": "Humata pectinata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Humata pectinata is often found in disturbed habitats such as agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types make it a common invasive species in many regions."
