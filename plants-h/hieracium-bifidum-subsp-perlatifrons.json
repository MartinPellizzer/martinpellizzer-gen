    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. perlatifrons, commonly known as the silverleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm, with hairy, sometimes silver-tomentose leaves that give it its common name. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its finely pubescent stems and leaves, as well as its unique floral structure."
