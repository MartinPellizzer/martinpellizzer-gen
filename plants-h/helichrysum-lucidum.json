It is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers and its ability to retain its color when dried, making it popular in floral arrangements. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or sandy environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its stems are erect and branched. Helichrysum lucidum is also valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
