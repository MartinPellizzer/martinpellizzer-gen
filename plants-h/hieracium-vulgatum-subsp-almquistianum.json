    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. almquistianum, commonly known as the Almqvist's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in the summer months. The plant is native to southern Scandinavia and is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sandy soils. It has a compact growth form and is often mistaken for other hawkweed species due to its similar appearance. The subspecies is notable for its specific ecological preferences and limited distribution."
