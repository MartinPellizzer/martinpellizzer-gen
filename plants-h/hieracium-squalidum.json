    "intro": "Hieracium squalidum, commonly known as the dirty hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and meadows, and is often found in moist or sandy environments. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a rough texture, while its flowers are yellow with prominent central disc florets. Hieracium squalidum is often considered a weed due to its ability to spread rapidly and colonize various habitats."
