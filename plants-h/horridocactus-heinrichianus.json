    "intro": "Horridocactus heinrichianus, commonly known as the Heinrich's cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the top of the stem. It has spiny, ribbed stems that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Horridocactus heinrichianus is well adapted to drought and full sun, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping."
