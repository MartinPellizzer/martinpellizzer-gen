    "intro": "Hersilia biloba, commonly known as the two-lobed milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many toxic plants with milky sap. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in umbels. Its most distinctive feature is its two-lobed seed pods, which split open to release seeds with silky hairs. Hersilia biloba is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
