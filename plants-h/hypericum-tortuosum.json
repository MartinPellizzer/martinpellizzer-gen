    "intro": "Hypericum tortuosum, commonly known as creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It features wiry, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, oval, and covered in fine hairs. Hypericum tortuosum is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils."
