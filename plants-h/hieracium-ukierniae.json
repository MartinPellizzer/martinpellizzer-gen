    "intro": "Hieracium ukierniae, commonly known as the Scottish dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the British Isles. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy areas and has a rosette of basal leaves with a woolly texture. It produces bright yellow flowers that develop into fluffy seed heads, facilitating wind pollination and seed dispersal. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many regions."
