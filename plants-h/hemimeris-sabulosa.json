    "intro": "Hemimeris sabulosa, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Hemimeris sabulosa is an important species for pollinators and is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats."
