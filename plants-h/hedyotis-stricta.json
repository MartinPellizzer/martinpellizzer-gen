It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, ascending stems that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers appear in clusters and bloom from late spring to early summer. Hedyotis stricta has lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its delicate appearance."
