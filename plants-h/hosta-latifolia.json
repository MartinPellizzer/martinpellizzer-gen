    "intro": "Hosta latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf hosta, is a popular ornamental plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 inches in length. The leaves are typically a deep green with a waxy texture and often display attractive variegation. It produces small, fragrant white flowers in late summer, though these are less showy than the foliage. This plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is well-suited for woodland gardens."
