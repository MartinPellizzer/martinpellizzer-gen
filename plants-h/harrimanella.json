    "intro": "Harrimanella, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its unique, delicate white petals that resemble translucent ghosts, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom during the brief summer months, typically between November and February. Harrimanella is known for its low-growing habit and ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments with minimal nutrients. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
