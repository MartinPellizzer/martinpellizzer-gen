    "intro": "Hieracium ermineum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm, featuring basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom from June to September. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, often forming dense mats in disturbed soils. Hieracium ermineum is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil."
