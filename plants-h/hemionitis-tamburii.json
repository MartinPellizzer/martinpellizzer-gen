    "intro": "Hemionitis tamburii, commonly known as the Tibetan waterwheel, is a rare aquatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of leaves, which resemble the spokes of a wheel, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments and is adapted to the extreme cold and low oxygen levels of its habitat. Its leaves are narrow and slightly curled, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis tamburii is considered a vulnerable species."
