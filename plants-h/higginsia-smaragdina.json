It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically bright green, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance. Botanically, it belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many other flowering plants with diverse growth forms."
