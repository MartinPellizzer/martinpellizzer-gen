    "intro": "Haematoxylum calakmulense, commonly known as the Mexican red sandalwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhamnaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Mexico and Central America, particularly in humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Its wood is valued for its rich reddish color and historical use in traditional crafts. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered endangered."
