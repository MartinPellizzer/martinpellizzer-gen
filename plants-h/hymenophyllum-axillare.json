    "intro": "Hymenophyllum axillare, commonly known as the axillary fern, is a small, delicate epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, often hair-like fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its spores are produced in tiny, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Hymenophyllum axillare is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums."
