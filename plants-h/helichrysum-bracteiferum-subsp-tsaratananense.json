    "intro": "Helichrysum bracteiferum subsp. tsaratananense, commonly known as the Tsaratanana helichrysum, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flower heads that resemble small suns. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the region's unique climate. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This species is of interest to botanists due to its distinct morphology and limited distribution."
