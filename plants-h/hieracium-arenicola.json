    "intro": "Hieracium arenicola, commonly known as the sand hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to sandy and coastal environments in Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as dunes, heaths, and coastal grasslands. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers range in color from yellow to reddish-orange. Hieracium arenicola plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and provides nectar for pollinators."
