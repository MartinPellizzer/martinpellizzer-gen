    "intro": "Horridocactus echinus var. minor, commonly known as the lesser hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are covered in small, tuberculate bumps. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne in clusters at the stem tips. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
