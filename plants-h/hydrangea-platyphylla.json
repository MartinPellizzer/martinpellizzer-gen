    "intro": "Hydrangea platyphylla, commonly known as the flatleaf hydrangea, is a species native to East Asia, particularly China and Japan. It is characterized by its large, round, and often white or pink bracts that surround small, sterile flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The color of its bracts can change depending on soil pH, with more acidic soils producing blue hues and alkaline soils resulting in pink or red tones."
