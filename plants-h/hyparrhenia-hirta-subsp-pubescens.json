    "intro": "Hyparrhenia hirta subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy hyparrhenia, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
