    "intro": "Helianthemum salicifolium var. brachypetalum, commonly known as the narrow-petaled rock rose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features compact, rounded foliage composed of leathery, lance-shaped leaves that are gray-green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for Mediterranean-style gardens."
