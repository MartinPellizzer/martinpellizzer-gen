    "intro": "Hylocharis hispida, commonly known as the hispid antshrike, is a small passerine bird native to South America. It belongs to the family Thamnophilidae, which includes antshrikes and related birds. The plant name is actually a misnomer, as Hylocharis hispida refers to a bird, not a plant. Therefore, there are no botanical aspects to discuss. I can't reply."
