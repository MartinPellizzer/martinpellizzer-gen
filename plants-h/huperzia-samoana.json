    "intro": "Huperzia samoana, commonly known as the Samoan huperzia, is a species of moss-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a distinctive structure with elongated, branching stems and small, linear leaves that are often arranged in two rows. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its leaf surface. Huperzia samoana is widely distributed across tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands."
