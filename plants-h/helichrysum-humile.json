    "intro": "Helichrysum humile, commonly known as the common everlasting or winter helichrysum, is a small, mat-forming perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of tiny, golden-yellow flowers that remain open throughout the year, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Helichrysum humile is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms."
