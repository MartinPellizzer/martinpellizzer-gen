    "intro": "Helichrysum parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, yellowish to orange flowers that are often retained on the plant even after flowering, giving it a dried flower appearance. The plant has silver-gray foliage with tiny, narrow leaves, and it is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, and is often used in garden settings for its ornamental value and hardiness. Helichrysum parvifolium is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
