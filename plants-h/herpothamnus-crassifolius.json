    "intro": "Herpothamnus crassifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved thyme, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and aromatic, hairy leaves that are typically broad and oval in shape. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or limestone-rich environments. Due to its hardy nature and pleasant scent, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for ornamental and culinary purposes."
