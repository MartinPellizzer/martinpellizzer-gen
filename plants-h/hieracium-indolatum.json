    "intro": "Hieracium indolatum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in summer, and the plant produces seeds in the form of small, hairy achenes. Hieracium indolatum is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
