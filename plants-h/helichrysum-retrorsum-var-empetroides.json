    "intro": "Helichrysum retrorsum var. empetroides, commonly known as the empetroides helichrysum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of golden-yellow, sun-like flowers. The plant features narrow, silver-gray leaves with a woolly texture, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. The species is also valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
