    "intro": "Hieracium naniceps, commonly known as the dwarf hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves that are usually heart-shaped and hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grasslands. Due to its small size and subtle appearance, it can be challenging to distinguish from other hawkweed species without close examination."
