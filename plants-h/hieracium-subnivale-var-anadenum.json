    "intro": "Hieracium subnivale var. anadenum, commonly known as the snow buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the snow has fully melted. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This variant is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and shorter pedicels compared to other Hieracium species."
