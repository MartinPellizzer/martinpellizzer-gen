    "intro": "Habenaria rariflora, commonly known as the rare-flowered orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that produce a few leaves and a single flower spike. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to aid in nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
