    "intro": "Hieracium raui, commonly known as the lesser hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium raui is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
