    "intro": "Hieracium sotkamoense, commonly known as the Sotkamo hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the northern regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, meadow-like habitats and has hairy stems and leaves. Its yellow flowers bloom in late summer, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
