    "intro": "Hydrocotyle umbellata var. ambigua, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating on the water surface, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white, umbellate flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its adaptability to aquatic environments makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
