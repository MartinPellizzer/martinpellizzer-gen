    "intro": "Helianthemum rupifragum, commonly known as the rock sunflower, is a low-growing shrub native to the rocky and alpine regions of southern Europe. It features small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has a compact, mat-like growth habit with hairy, evergreen leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in limestone or gravelly habitats. Its resilience to cold and drought makes it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
