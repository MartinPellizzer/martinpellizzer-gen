    "intro": "Hieracium kavinae, commonly known as the Kavina hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are usually basal, with a rough, hairy texture, and its flowers are yellow, often appearing in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hieracium kavinae is considered a rare and endemic species."
