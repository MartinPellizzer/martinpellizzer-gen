    "intro": "Hieracium microsphaericum, commonly known as the small globe hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Due to its low-growing habit and ornamental flowers, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
