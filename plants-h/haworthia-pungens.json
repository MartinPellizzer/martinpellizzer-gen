    "intro": "Haworthia pungens, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves that are often marked with distinctive white or yellow markings resembling a zebra's stripes. The leaves are thick and waxy, allowing the plant to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments. It produces small, star-shaped flowers on tall stalks during the summer months. This plant prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
