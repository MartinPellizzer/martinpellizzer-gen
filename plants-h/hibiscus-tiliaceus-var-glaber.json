It is characterized by its rough, often hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink or red, depending on the variety. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found growing near mangroves or in sandy soils. Hibiscus tiliaceus var. glaber is also known for its ability to tolerate salt spray and is sometimes used in coastal restoration projects."
