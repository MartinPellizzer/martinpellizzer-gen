    "intro": "Humiria balsamifera var. balsamifera, commonly known as the balsam fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the northeastern regions of North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, resinous scent and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in boreal and montane forests. The bark of this species is thick and scaly, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions."
