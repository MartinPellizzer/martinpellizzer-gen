    "intro": "Hydrocotyle artensis, commonly known as the water pennywort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It has finely divided, floating leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, dark berries. Hydrocotyle artensis thrives in still or slow-moving water and is often found in ponds, ditches, and wetlands. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative reproduction make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
