    "intro": "Hibiscus verbasciformis, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves and stems adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Hibiscus verbasciformis is part of the Malvaceae family, which includes other hibiscus species and cotton. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and low-maintenance gardening in hot, dry climates."
