    "intro": "Helianthemum \u00d7 fabadoi, commonly known as the hybrid rockrose, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Helianthemum nummularium and Helianthemum canariense. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, rounded foliage and showy yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is native to the Canary Islands and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its hardiness and ability to tolerate coastal conditions. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
