    "intro": "Hypericum pseudopatulum, commonly known as the purple-stemmed St. John's wort, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are often tinged with purple, and its clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or open fields. Hypericum pseudopatulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
