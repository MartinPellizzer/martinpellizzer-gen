    "intro": "Habenaria thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns. Thomson's orchid is often found in rocky or sandy soils and requires well-drained conditions for optimal growth."
