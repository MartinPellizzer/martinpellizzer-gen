    "intro": "Hieracium jaubertianum, commonly known as Jaubert's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering head composed of small yellow flowers. Native to Europe, it thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in natural habitats."
