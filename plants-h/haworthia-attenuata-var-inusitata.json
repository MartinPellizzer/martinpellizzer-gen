    "intro": "Haworthia attenuata var. inusitata, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves with distinctive white to pale blue markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The leaves are typically bluish-green with a waxy texture and can reach up to 10 inches in height. It produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers on tall, slender stems during the warmer months. This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
