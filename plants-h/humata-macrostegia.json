    "intro": "Humata macrostegia, commonly known as the broad-leaved humata, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming during the wet season. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common sight in disturbed soils. The leaves and stems are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties."
