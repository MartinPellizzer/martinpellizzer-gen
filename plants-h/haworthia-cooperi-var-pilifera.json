    "intro": "Haworthia cooperi var. pilifera, commonly known as the curly haworthia, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to South Africa. It features pale green, fleshy leaves with distinctive white to yellowish tubercles and tufts of fine, white hairs along the edges. The plant produces tall, slender stems with small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the growing season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
