    "intro": "Hygrophila glandulifera, commonly known as the spiked water plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming during the wet season. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Hygrophila glandulifera is often used in aquascaping due to its ornamental value and ability to oxygenate water."
