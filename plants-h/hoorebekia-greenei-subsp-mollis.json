    "intro": "Hoorebekia greenei subsp. mollis, commonly known as the soft-hoorebekia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers with a central disc surrounded by ray florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
