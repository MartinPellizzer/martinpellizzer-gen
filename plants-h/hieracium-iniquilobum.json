    "intro": "Hieracium iniquilobum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are narrow and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
