    "intro": "Helianthemum rubellum var. argenteum, commonly known as the silver sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to southern Europe. It features compact, succulent leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant once established. This variety is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in arid landscapes due to its ornamental value and hardy nature."
