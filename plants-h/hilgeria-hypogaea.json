    "intro": "Hilgeria hypogaea, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, characterized by its woody stems and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the summer months. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils with minimal water. Hilgeria hypogaea is well adapted to harsh desert environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
