    "intro": "Hepatica hepatica, commonly known as the liverleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the forests of eastern North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmately divided leaves that resemble a liver, hence its common name. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of white, blue, or purple, typically blooming in early spring. Hepatica hepatica thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland habitats. Its early blooming period makes it an important early nectar source for pollinators."
