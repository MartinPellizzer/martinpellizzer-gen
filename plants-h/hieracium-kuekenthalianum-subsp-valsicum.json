    "intro": "Hieracium kuekenthalianum subsp. valsicum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
