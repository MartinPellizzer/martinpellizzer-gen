    "intro": "Hedysarum congestum, commonly known as the clustered vetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow or orange-red pea-like flowers. Its fruit is a slender pod that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Hedysarum congestum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
