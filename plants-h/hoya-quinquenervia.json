    "intro": "Hoya quinquenervia, commonly known as the five-veined wax plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, and often variegated leaves that are heart-shaped or ovate. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring or early summer. Hoya quinquenervia is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light. It is also noted for its ability to climb or trail, making it suitable for hanging baskets or shelves."
