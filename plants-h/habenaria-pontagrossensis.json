    "intro": "Habenaria pontagrossensis, commonly known as the Brazilian marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy habitats and is adapted to humid, tropical climates. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it survive in waterlogged soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
