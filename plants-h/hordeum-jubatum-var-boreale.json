    "intro": "Hordeum jubatum var. boreale, commonly known as the Arctic wild oat, is a perennial grass native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and nutrient-poor soils, often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of Arctic ecosystems."
