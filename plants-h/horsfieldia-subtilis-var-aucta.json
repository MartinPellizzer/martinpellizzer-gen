    "intro": "Horsfieldia subtilis var. aucta, commonly known as the Hainan orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Hainan Island in China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pendulous inflorescence bearing small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its botanical features include lanceolate leaves and a compact, pseudobulbous structure typical of many orchid species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
