    "intro": "Henckelia briggsioides, commonly known as the Australian ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments with rich, well-drained soil, typically found in moist, rocky areas. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of its leaves, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Henckelia briggsioides is considered a conservation concern."
