    "intro": "Hapalochilus inclinatus, commonly known as the leaning lily, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant features strap-like leaves that are often clustered at the base, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Hapalochilus inclinatus is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its beauty. However, it is relatively rare in the wild and requires specific conditions to grow successfully."
