    "intro": "Hypoxis infausta, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a member of the Asparagaceae family and is native to South Africa. It is a small, perennial herb characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a single umbel at the center of the rosette. Hypoxis infausta thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its low-growing habit and ornamental appeal."
