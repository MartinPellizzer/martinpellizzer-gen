It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in mountainous regions. It has finely divided, grass-like leaves and produces numerous small, elongated seeds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
