    "intro": "Hypericum pseudopetiolatum var. grandiflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered St. John's wort, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences, and the plant is often found in moist, woodland habitats. It is part of the Hypericaceae family and is known for its medicinal properties, though its use is limited due to potential toxicity."
