    "intro": "Howardia macradenia, commonly known as the red-hot poker, is a striking perennial plant native to South Africa. It features tall, upright stems that bear bright orange to red bracts, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its drought tolerance and vibrant color make it a standout addition to any garden."
