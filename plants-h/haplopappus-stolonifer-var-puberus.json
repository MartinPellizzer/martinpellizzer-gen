    "intro": "Haplopappus stolonifer var. puberus, commonly known as the hairy stoloniferous haplopappus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes to form dense mats. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in heads, surrounded by pale, hairy bracts. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered with fine pubescence, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. This species is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to harsh environmental conditions."
