    "intro": "Hammada eigii, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils. Hammada eigii is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in harsh desert conditions."
