    "intro": "Huberantha palawanensis, commonly known as the Palawan bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas of montane forests, often at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered with a fine layer of pubescence, while its stems are slender and often hairy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
