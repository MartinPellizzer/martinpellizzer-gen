    "intro": "Helleborus dumetorum f. laciniatus, commonly known as the fragrant hellebore or the cut-leaf hellebore, is a variant of the European hellebore. It is characterized by its finely cut, dark green leaves that give it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in late winter or early spring. It is a perennial herb that thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodlands and rocky soils. Its foliage and flowers are both ornamental and have been historically used in traditional medicine."
