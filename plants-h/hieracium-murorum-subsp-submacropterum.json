    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. submacropterum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The subspecies submacropterum is distinguished by its larger, more robust leaves compared to other subspecies of Hieracium murorum. It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats such as meadows and roadsides. This plant is often considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively."
