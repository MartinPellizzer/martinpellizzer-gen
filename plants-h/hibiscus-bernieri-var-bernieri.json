    "intro": "Hibiscus bernieri var. bernieri, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant has rough, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Hibiscus bernieri var. bernieri is well adapted to dry, hot climates and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats."
