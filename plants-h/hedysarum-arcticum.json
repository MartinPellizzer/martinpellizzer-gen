    "intro": "Hedysarum arcticum, commonly known as Arctic sweet clover, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Hedysarum arcticum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is part of the legume family, capable of nitrogen fixation."
