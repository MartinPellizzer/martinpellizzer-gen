    "intro": "Hieracium nipholepium, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in high-altitude conditions. Hieracium nipholepium is adapted to harsh climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas."
