It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming during the spring and summer seasons. Helia glabra is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or shrubland habitats. Its botanical features make it an attractive subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
