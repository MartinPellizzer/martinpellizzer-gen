    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. pseudocrebridens, commonly known as the false yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its yellowish-orange composite flowers and basal rosettes of lanceolate leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. It has a creeping rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively. Its botanical features make it a common weed in temperate regions of Europe and parts of North America."
