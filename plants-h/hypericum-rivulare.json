    "intro": "Hypericum rivulare, commonly known as the water St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in moist, often waterlogged soils along stream banks and wet meadows. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are usually opposite, with a slightly hairy texture. It belongs to the genus Hypericum, which includes many species known for their medicinal properties. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
