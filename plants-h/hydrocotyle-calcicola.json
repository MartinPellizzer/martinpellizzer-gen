    "intro": "Hydrocotyle calcicola, commonly known as the limestone bladderleaf, is a rare perennial herb native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, typically found in limestone formations. Its flowering stems produce clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hydrocotyle calcicola is considered a vulnerable species."
