    "intro": "Hieracium strimaense, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Hieracium strimaense is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
