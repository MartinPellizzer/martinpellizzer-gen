    "intro": "Hieracium ciliatum var. repandum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows, roadsides, and wetlands. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, ciliate leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its scientific name. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
