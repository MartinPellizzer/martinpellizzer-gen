    "intro": "Hieracium fagicola, commonly known as the forest dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest floors, where it thrives in the dappled light beneath tree canopies. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its yellow flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer, are surrounded by bracts that resemble petals. Hieracium fagicola is known for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora."
