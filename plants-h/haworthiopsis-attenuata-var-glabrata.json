    "intro": "Haworthiopsis attenuata var. glabrata, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, bluish-green leaves with distinctive white or pale markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers on slender stems during the growing season. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in bright, indirect light with minimal watering. Its compact size and unique appearance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
