    "intro": "Hymenaea olfersiana, commonly known as the Brazil wood, is a tropical tree native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dark, reddish wood, which was historically valuable for its use in making violin bows and fine furniture. The plant has compound leaves with stipules and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a legume that contains several seeds, and the tree is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered in some regions."
