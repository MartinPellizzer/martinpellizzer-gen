    "intro": "Hieracium praviforme, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and its leaves are narrow and hairy. Hieracium praviforme is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habits and ability to spread rapidly."
