    "intro": "Helianthemum ericoides, commonly known as the dwarf sunflower or heather sunflower, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has compact, evergreen foliage with a dense, cushion-like growth habit. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Helianthemum ericoides is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
