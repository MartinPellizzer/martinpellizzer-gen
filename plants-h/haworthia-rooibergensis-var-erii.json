It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or pale blue markings. The leaves are often adorned with translucent windows, allowing light to penetrate and enhance the plant's ability to photosynthesize. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
