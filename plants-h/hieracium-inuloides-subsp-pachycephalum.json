    "intro": "Hieracium inuloides subsp. pachycephalum, commonly known as the thick-headed hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy stems and basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a single terminal head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
