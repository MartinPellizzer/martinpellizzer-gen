    "intro": "Helictochloa planiculmis, commonly known as the flat-leaf hairgrass, is a species of grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, flat leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant typically grows in low, dense tufts and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is small and compact. Helictochloa planiculmis plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
