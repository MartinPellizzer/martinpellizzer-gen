    "intro": "Hoplophytum spicatum, commonly known as the spiky euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by spiny, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Hoplophytum spicatum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in dry environments."
