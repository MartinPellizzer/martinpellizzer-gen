    "intro": "Hieracium umbellosum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a tall, branched stem. The plant produces yellow flowers in a loose, umbrella-like cluster called an umbel, which is typical of its genus. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Hieracium umbellosum is known for its ability to spread rapidly through its rhizomes and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
