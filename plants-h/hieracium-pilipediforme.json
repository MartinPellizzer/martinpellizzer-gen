    "intro": "Hieracium pilipediforme, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are broadly lance-shaped and often covered with fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disc. Hieracium pilipediforme is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
