It features upright, hairy stems that bear alternate, arrow-shaped leaves with a distinctive sagittate base. The plant produces small, yellowish composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves and stems are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, often forming dense mats."
