    "intro": "Hieracium britannicoides, commonly known as the British hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the daisy family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It produces numerous small seeds that are dispersed by the wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Due to its aggressive growth, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and garden settings."
