    "intro": "Hieracium chloropoecilum, commonly known as the green-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, greenish-gray leaves and produces yellow flowers in a single head. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
