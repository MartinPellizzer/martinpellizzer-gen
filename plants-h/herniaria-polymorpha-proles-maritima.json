    "intro": "Herniaria polymorpha proles maritima, commonly known as the sea herniaria, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in the summer. This plant is typically found on sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. It has a compact structure that helps it resist wind and salt spray, making it well adapted to harsh maritime conditions. Its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils makes it an important component of coastal plant communities."
