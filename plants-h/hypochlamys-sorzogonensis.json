    "intro": "Hypochlamys sorzogonensis, commonly known as the Philippine orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and specialized growth habits. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical forest environments. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and often have a distinct coloration that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern."
