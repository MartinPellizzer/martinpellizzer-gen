    "intro": "Hirtella carbonaria, commonly known as the glossy hirtella, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom during the wet season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Hirtella carbonaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
