    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. brachyodon, commonly known as the short-stemmed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
