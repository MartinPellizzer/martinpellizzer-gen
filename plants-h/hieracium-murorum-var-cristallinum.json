    "intro": "Hieracium murorum var. cristallinum, commonly known as the crystal-haired hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, often silver-tomentose leaves and bright yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in meadows, and thrives in full sun. Its varietal name, *cristallinum*, refers to the crystalline appearance of its foliage due to the dense covering of fine hairs. It is considered a minor weed but has some ornamental value in garden settings."
