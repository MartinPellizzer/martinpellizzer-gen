    "intro": "Hieracium constringens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while the flowers are yellow with a central disc. Hieracium constringens is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common but sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
