It typically grows in dry, grassy habitats and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant has rough, hairy foliage that often appears bluish-green due to a waxy coating. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into cylindrical, ribbed achenes.
