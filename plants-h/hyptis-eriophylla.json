    "intro": "Hyptis eriophylla, commonly known as silverleaf hyptis, is a perennial shrub native to the Americas. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its compact, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. Hyptis eriophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
