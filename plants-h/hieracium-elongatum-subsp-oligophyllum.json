It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and basal leaves that are typically lanceolate in shape. The plant produces yellow flower heads composed of many small florets, which are arranged in a composite structure typical of the daisy family. It is native to Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
