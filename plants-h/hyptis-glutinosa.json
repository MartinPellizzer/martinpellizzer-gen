The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Hyptis glutinosa is known for its sticky secretions, which help protect it from herbivores and promote moisture retention."
