    "intro": "Hoffmannseggia falcaria var. pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's hoffmannseggia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains in South America. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and slender, branching stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically narrow, fleshy, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, aiding in water retention. This species is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
