    "intro": "Heterotheca ballardii, commonly known as the Ballard's goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its yellow flowers bloom in late summer, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Heterotheca ballardii is noted for its ecological importance in supporting pollinators and its resilience to arid conditions."
