It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands. The plant features slender, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. Its flowers are small and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, usually appearing in shades of white or pale pink. Hydroglossum japonicum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
