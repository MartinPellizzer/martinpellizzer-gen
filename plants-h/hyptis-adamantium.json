    "intro": "Hyptis adamantium, commonly known as the silverleaf hyptis, is a perennial shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in whorled clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks. Hyptis adamantium is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing benefits."
