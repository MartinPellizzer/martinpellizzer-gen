    "intro": "Hosta lancifolia f. albomarginata, commonly known as the white-edged swordleaf hosta, is a varietal form of the swordleaf hosta, characterized by its striking white margins on the otherwise deep green leaves. This plant belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is native to eastern Asia, particularly China. Its foliage is broad, lance-shaped, and often reaches lengths of up to 30 inches, making it a dramatic statement in the garden. The plant produces small, fragrant, white flowers in late summer, though it is primarily cultivated for its ornamental foliage. It thrives in partial to full shade and requires moist, well-drained soil."
