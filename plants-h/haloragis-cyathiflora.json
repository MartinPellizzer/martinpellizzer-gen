    "intro": "Haloragis cyathiflora, commonly known as the coastal flax or sea flax, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize coastal dunes. Haloragis cyathiflora is adapted to saline and windy environments, making it an important plant for coastal ecosystems."
