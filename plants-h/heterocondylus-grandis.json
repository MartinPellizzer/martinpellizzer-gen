    "intro": "Heterocondylus grandis, commonly known as the giant sedge, is a tall, perennial plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the sedge family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils. Heterocondylus grandis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
