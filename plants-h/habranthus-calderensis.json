    "intro": "Habranthus calderensis, commonly known as the Calder Mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, seed-filled capsules after flowering. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
