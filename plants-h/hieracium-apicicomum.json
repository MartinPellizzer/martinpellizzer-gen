    "intro": "Hieracium apicicomum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and can reach heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are hairy and often have a serrated edge, while its flowers consist of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk. It is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
