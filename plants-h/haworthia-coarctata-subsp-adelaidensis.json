It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with distinctive white or pale markings. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires minimal watering to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and rock gardens."
