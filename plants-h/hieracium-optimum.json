    "intro": "Hieracium optimum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellowish-orange flowers and hairy stems, often found in meadows and disturbed soils. The plant produces numerous small, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Hieracium optimum is an invasive species in many regions, often outcompeting native plants due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production."
