    "intro": "Hoya parasitica var. citrina, commonly known as the golden hoya, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asclepiadaceae. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients while still performing some photosynthesis. The plant is characterized by its waxy, succulent leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow to orange. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia, and thrives in warm, humid environments. Due to its unique appearance and parasitic nature, it is a popular choice for collectors and enthusiasts of rare houseplants."
