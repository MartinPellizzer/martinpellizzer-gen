    "intro": "Hypericum fallax f. punctatum, commonly known as the spotted St. John's wort, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often adorned with distinctive white or yellow spots, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typical of the Hypericum genus. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings."
