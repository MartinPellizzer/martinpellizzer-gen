    "intro": "Humbertacalia pyrifolia, commonly known as the fireleaf plant, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a shrub characterized by its striking, lobed leaves that resemble the shape of a fire leaf, hence its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in clusters. Its botanical features include a woody stem, opposite leaf arrangement, and a preference for well-drained, sandy soils. Humbertacalia pyrifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
