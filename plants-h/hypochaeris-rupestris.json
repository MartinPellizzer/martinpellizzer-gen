    "intro": "Hypochaeris rupestris, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy white seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hypochaeris rupestris is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
