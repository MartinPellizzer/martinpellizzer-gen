    "intro": "Hymenophyllum alternatum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. Its fronds are typically short and clustered, and it produces tiny, spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its leaves. Hymenophyllum alternatum is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks, where it absorbs moisture from the air."
