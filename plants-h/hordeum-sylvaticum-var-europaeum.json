It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks, and is often found in temperate climates. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces spikelets that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Its flowers are small and wind-pollinated, and it is known for its adaptability to various environmental conditions. This species is also of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for genetic improvement in cultivated barley varieties."
