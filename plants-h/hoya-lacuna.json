    "intro": "Hoya lacuna, commonly known as the \"Hoya with a gap,\" is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its waxy, fleshy leaves that are typically oval or heart-shaped. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink in color. Hoya lacuna thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique name refers to the noticeable gap or indentation in the center of its leaves."
