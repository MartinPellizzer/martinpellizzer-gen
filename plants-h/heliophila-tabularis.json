    "intro": "Heliophila tabularis, commonly known as the flatleaf water plantain, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Alismataceae family and is characterized by its broad, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread across shallow water bodies, contributing to aquatic ecosystem stability. Heliophila tabularis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and provide habitat for aquatic life."
