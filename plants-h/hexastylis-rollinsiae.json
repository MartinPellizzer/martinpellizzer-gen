    "intro": "Hexastylis rollinsiae, commonly known as the Florida panther's fern, is a rare and endangered species native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Aristolochiaceae and is characterized by its unique, heart-shaped leaves and intricate, spiral-arranged stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often hidden within its foliage, a feature common in the Aristolochiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and hardwood forests. Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
