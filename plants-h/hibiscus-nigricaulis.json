    "intro": "Hibiscus nigricaulis, commonly known as the black-stem hibiscus, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its stems are notably dark in color, giving it its common name, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Hibiscus nigricaulis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
