    "intro": "Hippocrepis dicarpa, commonly known as the two-seeded orchid, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its flowers are usually pale purple or white, with a distinctive two-lobed structure that sets it apart from other orchids. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release the two seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
