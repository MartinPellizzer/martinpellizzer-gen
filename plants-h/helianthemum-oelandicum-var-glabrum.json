    "intro": "Helianthemum oelandicum var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a vibrant touch to rocky or sandy soils. The plant has a compact, mat-like growth habit, making it well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, though the 'glabrum' variety is distinguished by its smooth, hairless foliage. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, requiring minimal maintenance once established."
