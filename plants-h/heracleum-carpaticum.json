    "intro": "Heracleum carpaticum, commonly known as the Carpathian cow parsnip, is a tall biennial plant native to the Carpathian region of Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its large, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant can grow up to 2 meters in height, with a smooth, hollow stem that is often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically arranged in umbrella-like inflorescences, a feature typical of the carrot family. Heracleum carpaticum is also known for its potential toxicity, with some parts of the plant containing irritants that can cause skin reactions."
