    "intro": "Haemocharis stricta, commonly known as the pink torch ginger, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking pink bracts that resemble torches, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Haemocharis stricta is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant due to its vibrant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
