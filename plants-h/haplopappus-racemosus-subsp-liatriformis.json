    "intro": "Haplopappus racemosus subsp. liatriformis, commonly known as the Sierra needlestem, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive bracts. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils and open habitats. Its leaves are needle-like and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The subspecies is distinguished by its elongated, racemose inflorescence and specific morphological traits that set it apart from other members of the species."
