    "intro": "Hieracium pallidifrons, commonly known as the pale-fronted hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and basal rosette of leaves, typical of many hawkweed species. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grassy areas. It has hairy stems and leaves, and its flowers are arranged in a single inflorescence at the top of the stem. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
