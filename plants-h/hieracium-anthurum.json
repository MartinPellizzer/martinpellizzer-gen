It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in a flat-topped cluster. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are alternate and often lobed. Native to Europe, it is often found in meadows and grasslands. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
