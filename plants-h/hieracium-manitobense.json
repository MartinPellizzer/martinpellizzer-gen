It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in the summer. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
