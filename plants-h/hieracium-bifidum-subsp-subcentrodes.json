    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. subcentrodes, commonly known as the narrow-centre hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that are typically arranged in a single head, with ray florets that are shorter than the central disk. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
