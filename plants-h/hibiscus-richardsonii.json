    "intro": "Hibiscus richardsonii, commonly known as the Texas hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, featuring thick, waxy leaves to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom in late summer to early fall. Hibiscus richardsonii is adapted to hot, dry climates and is often found in rocky soils along canyons and cliffs. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and resilient species within the Malvaceae family."
