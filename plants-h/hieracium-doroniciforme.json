    "intro": "Hieracium doroniciforme, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its hairy, often reddish stems and basal rosettes of broad, lobed leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, flat-topped clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. Its common name reflects its appearance, with \"woolly\" referring to the dense pubescence on its stems and leaves."
