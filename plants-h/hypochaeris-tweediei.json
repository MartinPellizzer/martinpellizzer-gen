    "intro": "Hypochaeris tweediei, commonly known as the yellow weed or lesser hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often hairy as well. Hypochaeris tweediei is known for its ability to spread rapidly through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common weed in many regions."
