    "intro": "Hydrocotyle quinqueloba var. asterias, commonly known as the star-leaf water plantain, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features distinctive, palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, often appearing star-shaped, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Its small, white flowers bloom in summer, and it produces floating or submerged leaves depending on water conditions. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and fish."
