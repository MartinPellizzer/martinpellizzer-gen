    "intro": "Helianthemum asperum var. grandiflorum, commonly known as the rough hollyhock, is a succulent shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, spiny stems covered in short, stiff hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically gray-green, with a rough texture, and it often forms low, sprawling mats. This variety is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant in xeriscaped gardens."
