    "intro": "Hypaphorus subumbrans var. inermis, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white or pale pink during the late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
