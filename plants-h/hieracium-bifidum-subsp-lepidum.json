It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray leaves and yellowish composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges. It has a creeping rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
