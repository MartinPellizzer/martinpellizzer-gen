    "intro": "Heppiella verticillata, commonly known as the spiral liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its structure consists of a thallus with closely spaced, spirally arranged leaf-like structures called phyllodes. Heppiella verticillata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
