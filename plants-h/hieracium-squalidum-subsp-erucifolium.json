    "intro": "Hieracium squalidum subsp. erucifolium, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in a flat-topped inflorescence, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
