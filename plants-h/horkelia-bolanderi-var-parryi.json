    "intro": "Horkelia bolanderi var. parryi, commonly known as Bolander's horkelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, daisy-like flowers. The species thrives in rocky, arid environments and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
