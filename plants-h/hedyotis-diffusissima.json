    "intro": "Hedyotis diffusissima, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its stems spread along the ground, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Hedyotis diffusissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
