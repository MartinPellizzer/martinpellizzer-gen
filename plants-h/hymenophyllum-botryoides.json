    "intro": "Hymenophyllum botryoides, commonly known as the clustered filmy fern, is a delicate epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its small, translucent, and often overlapping fronds that give it a lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-bearing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Hymenophyllum botryoides plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and providing microhabitats for various organisms."
