    "intro": "Hieracium sulphureum subsp. brevicaule, commonly known as the sulphur hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features basal rosettes of spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow-orange composite flowers in late summer. Its inflorescence consists of a single, showy capitulum surrounded by leaf-like bracts. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter, more compact growth habit compared to other members of the species."
