    "intro": "Huernia brevirostris var. ecornuta, commonly known as the horned moon cactus, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features a swollen, fleshy stem that resembles a cactus, with a distinctive horn-like protrusion at the top. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
