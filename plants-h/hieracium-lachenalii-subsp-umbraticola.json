    "intro": "Hieracium lachenalii subsp. umbraticola, commonly known as the shadowy hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. It has a compact growth habit and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the genus Hieracium."
