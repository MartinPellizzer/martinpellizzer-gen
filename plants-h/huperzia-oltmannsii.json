Native to regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of China and Vietnam, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Huperzia oltmannsii is often found in rocky crevices and forest floors, where it plays a role in soil stabilization. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
