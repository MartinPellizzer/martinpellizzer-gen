    "intro": "Hordeum vulgare var. harlanii, commonly known as Harlan's barley, is a wild variant of barley native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, hard grains that are typically yellow or brown in color. This variety is often found in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and a flowering period that occurs in late spring to early summer. Harlan's barley is of interest to researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to harsh climates."
