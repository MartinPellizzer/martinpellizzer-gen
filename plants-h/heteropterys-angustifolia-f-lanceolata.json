    "intro": "Heteropterys angustifolia f. lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf heteropterys, is a variant of the species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical form. The plant belongs to the Malvaceae family and is often found in humid, shaded environments within the understory of tropical forests. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in axillary inflorescences, and are typically white or pale pink in color. The leaves are often covered in a fine pubescence, which helps in reducing water loss in its humid habitat."
