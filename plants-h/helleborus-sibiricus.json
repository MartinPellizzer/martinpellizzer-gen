    "intro": "Helleborus sibiricus, commonly known as Siberian hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dark green, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces upright, spiny stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, greenish-white flowers. These flowers are typically borne in early spring before the leaves emerge. Helleborus sibiricus is known for its toxic properties, containing various alkaloids that can be harmful if ingested."
