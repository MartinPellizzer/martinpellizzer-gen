It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are hairy and alternate, with a distinctive yellowish-green color, while the flowers are small and yellow, forming dense clusters. It is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
