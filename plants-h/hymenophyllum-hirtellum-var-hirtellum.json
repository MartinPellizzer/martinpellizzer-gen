    "intro": "Hymenophyllum hirtellum var. hirtellum, commonly known as the hairy toothed fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lanceolate fronds covered in fine, hairy structures that give it its common name. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with margins that are toothed or serrated. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
