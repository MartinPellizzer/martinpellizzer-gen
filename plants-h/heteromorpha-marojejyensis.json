    "intro": "Heteromorpha marojejyensis, commonly known as the Marojejy heteromorpha, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the Marojejy National Park in northeastern Madagascar. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to the humid, tropical rainforest environment, thriving in the shaded undergrowth. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, it faces significant threats to its survival."
