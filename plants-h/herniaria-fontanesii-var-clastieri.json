    "intro": "Herniaria fontanesii var. clastieri, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and arid environments. It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
