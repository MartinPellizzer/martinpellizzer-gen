    "intro": "Hedysarum hedysaroides subsp. sachalinense, commonly known as the Sakhalin milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the Russian Far East and parts of northeastern China. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and trifoliate leaves with small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in elongated racemes, which are typically followed by slender, pod-like fruits. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in forested or shrubland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
