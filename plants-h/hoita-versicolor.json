    "intro": "Hoita versicolor, commonly known as the variable hoya, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asclepiadaceae. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, depending on the variety. Hoita versicolor is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its ornamental value. It is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
