    "intro": "Hieracium erucifolium, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant features hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it can outcompete native flora and is sometimes considered a weed."
