    "intro": "Haworthia rossouwii var. scabra, commonly known as the Rossouw\u2019s Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or pale markings. The leaves are often covered in a fine, granular texture, giving the plant its common name \"scabra,\" which means rough in Latin. It produces small, white or pale green flowers on tall, slender stems during the summer months. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
