    "intro": "Hieracium pallidum subsp. acrocrocydotum, commonly known as the pale hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. The plant features bright yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, with leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, and it produces small, dry fruits called cypsela that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is characterized by its distinctive white markings on the flower heads, which aid in its identification."
