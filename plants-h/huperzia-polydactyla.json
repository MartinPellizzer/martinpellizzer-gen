    "intro": "Huperzia polydactyla, commonly known as the many-fingered huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its sporangia are clustered in small, rounded structures called sori, which are usually located on the underside of the leaves. Huperzia polydactyla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens or as a houseplant."
