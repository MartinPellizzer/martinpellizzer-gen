    "intro": "Heteropappus hispidus f. hispidissimus, commonly known as the hispid bristleweed, is a variant of the heteropappus hispidus species. It is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. The plant is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry environments. Its inflorescence consists of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The subspecies f. hispidissimus is distinguished by its increased density of hairs, making it more resilient to harsh conditions."
