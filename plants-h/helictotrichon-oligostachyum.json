It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wet meadows. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
