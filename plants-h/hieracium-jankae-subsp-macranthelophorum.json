    "intro": "Hieracium jankae subsp. macranthelophorum, commonly known as the mountain hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming basal leaves and yellow to orange flowering heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in harsh, cold environments. Its flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
