    "intro": "Hippotis ecuatoriana, commonly known as the Ecuadorian bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its carnivorous nature, using specialized structures to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and has small, floating leaves that help it absorb sunlight. Its flowers are usually small and yellow, with a distinctive bilabiate structure typical of the family. Hippotis ecuatoriana plays an important ecological role in its habitat by controlling populations of small invertebrates and contributing to nutrient cycling."
