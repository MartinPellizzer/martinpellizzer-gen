    "intro": "Hieracium mecistolepis, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are broadly lance-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Hieracium mecistolepis is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
