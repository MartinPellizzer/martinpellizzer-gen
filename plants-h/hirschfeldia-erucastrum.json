    "intro": "Hirschfeldia erucastrum, commonly known as the desert hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows from 10 to 30 centimeters in height, with hairy, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers bloom in shades of yellow to orange, often appearing in late summer to early fall. Hirschfeldia erucastrum is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in low-nutrient conditions."
