It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has glandular hairs that produce a sticky substance, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a suitable plant for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
