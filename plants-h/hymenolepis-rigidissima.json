    "intro": "Hymenolepis rigidissima, commonly known as the rigid leathery fern, is a species of fern characterized by its dense, leathery fronds. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help in spreading and anchoring the plant. Its fronds are typically pinnately compound, with a rigid and sturdy structure that gives it its common name. Hymenolepis rigidissima is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices."
