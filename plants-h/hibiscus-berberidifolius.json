    "intro": "Hibiscus berberidifolius, commonly known as the rock hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a prominent yellow or red throat. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a rough texture and a distinctive yellowish-green underside. Hibiscus berberidifolius is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a resilient species in tropical and subtropical regions."
