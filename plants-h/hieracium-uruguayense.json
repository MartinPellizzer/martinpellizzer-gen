    "intro": "Hieracium uruguayense, commonly known as the Uruguay hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Uruguay and Argentina. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. It has basal leaves that are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium uruguayense is often considered a weed due to its rapid spread and ability to colonize disturbed soils."
