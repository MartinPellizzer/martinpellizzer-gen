It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features basal rosettes of serrated, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers with ray florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in some regions."
