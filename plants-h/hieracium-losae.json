    "intro": "Hieracium losae, commonly known as the Losa's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its yellow flowers bloom in late summer, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium losae is often found in open grasslands and meadows at high altitudes."
