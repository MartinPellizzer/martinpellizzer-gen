    "intro": "Haworthia schuldtiana var. maculata, commonly known as the spotted haworthia, is a compact, succulent plant native to South Africa. It features dense rosettes of fleshy, triangular leaves with a pale green base and distinctive white or yellowish spots. The leaves are often adorned with a thin, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires minimal watering, making it ideal for indoor cultivation."
