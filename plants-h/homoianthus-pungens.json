    "intro": "Homoianthus pungens, commonly known as the spiny poinsettia, is a shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking red bracts that surround small, inconspicuous yellow flowers. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are typically green and ovate, with a slightly hairy texture. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant, especially during the holiday season due to its association with Christmas."
