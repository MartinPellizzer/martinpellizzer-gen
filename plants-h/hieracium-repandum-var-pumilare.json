    "intro": "Hieracium repandum var. pumilare, commonly known as the mouse-ear hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, hairy leaves that are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its rapid spread, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
