    "intro": "Hirtzia dodsoniana, commonly known as the Dodson's hirtzia, is a flowering plant native to the island of Moorea in French Polynesia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its small, pink to purple flowers and hairy stems, which give it its scientific name \"hirtzia\" meaning \"hairy.\" It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in coastal areas and forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
