    "intro": "Helianthemum glaucum subsp. sitifense, commonly known as the narrow-leaved helianthemum, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It is a low-growing shrub with succulent, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a suitable ornamental plant for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
