    "intro": "Hutchinsia inopinata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pale green leaves and its unique, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late winter. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to survive. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
