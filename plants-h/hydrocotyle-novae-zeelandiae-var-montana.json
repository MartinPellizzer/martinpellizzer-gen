    "intro": "Hydrocotyle novae-zeelandiae var. montana, commonly known as the mountain marsh mallow, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its habitat."
