    "intro": "Hedyotis macrostegia, commonly known as the broad-leaved inchplant, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial with opposite, ovate leaves that have a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
