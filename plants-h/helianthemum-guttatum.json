    "intro": "Helianthemum guttatum, commonly known as the spotted stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features fleshy, gray-green leaves with distinctive reddish or purplish spots, which help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact form and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
