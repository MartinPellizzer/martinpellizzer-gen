    "intro": "Hibiscus columbinus, commonly known as the scarlet hibiscus, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to deep red, typically blooming in late summer to early fall. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its fibrous roots and woody stems make it adaptable to various soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions. Hibiscus columbinus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
