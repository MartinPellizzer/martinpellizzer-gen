    "intro": "Hyalisma, commonly known as false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asparagaceae. It comprises several species, most of which are native to southern Africa. The plants typically have narrow, sword-shaped leaves and produce clusters of small, white or greenish flowers. They are often found in rocky or sandy soils and can thrive in arid environments. Hyalisma species are generally hardy and drought-tolerant, making them suitable for xeriscaping in dry climates."
