It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy, glandular leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Its small, sticky seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils. This variety is distinguished by its unique morphology and adaptation to arid conditions."
