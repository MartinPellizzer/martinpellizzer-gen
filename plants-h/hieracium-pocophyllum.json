    "intro": "Hieracium pocophyllum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its yellow flowers are relatively small and clustered in a flat-topped arrangement, and it produces seeds through achenes. Hieracium pocophyllum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread prolifically."
