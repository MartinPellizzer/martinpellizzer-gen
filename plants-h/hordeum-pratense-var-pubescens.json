    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hordeem pratense var. pubescens, commonly known as pubescent bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are covered with fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains, typical of the grass family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in natural habitats."
