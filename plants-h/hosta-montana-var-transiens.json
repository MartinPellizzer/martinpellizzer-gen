    "intro": "Hosta montana var. transiens, commonly known as the transition hosta, is a cultivar prized for its unique foliage characteristics. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that transition from a deep green on the upper surface to a lighter, often variegated color on the underside. This variegation creates a striking visual contrast, making it a popular choice for shade gardens. The plant is relatively low maintenance, thriving in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade. Its foliage remains attractive throughout the growing season, offering ornamental value without the need for flowering."
