    "intro": "Hieracium lachenalii subsp. asyngamicum, commonly known as the Lachenal's hawkweed, is a rare and distinctive member of the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its yellowish to reddish flowers and is typically found in alpine or subalpine regions. The subspecies is notable for its unique floral morphology, which includes a lack of a central disk, giving it a more open appearance. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous areas of Central Europe. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
