    "intro": "Helosciadium repens, commonly known as creeping helosciadium, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Helosciadium repens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
