    "intro": "Hieracium bicipitans, commonly known as the two-headed hawkweed, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family (Compositae). It is characterized by its distinctive two-headed inflorescence, which consists of two separate flower heads on a single stem. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with ray florets. Hieracium bicipitans is native to Europe and has been introduced to other parts of the world, where it can sometimes become invasive."
