    "intro": "Hieracium adamplians, commonly known as the greater hairy hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are rough and hairy, with a serrated edge, and its flowers are yellow with a central disk. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
