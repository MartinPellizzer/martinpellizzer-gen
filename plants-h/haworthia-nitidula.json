    "intro": "Haworthia nitidula, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in white, waxy tubercles, giving it a distinctive zebra-like appearance. The leaves are typically a pale green color with a bluish tinge, and they are thick and fleshy to store water. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers on slender stems during the summer months. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
