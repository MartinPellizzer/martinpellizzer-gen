    "intro": "Houstonia filifolia, commonly known as silky blue-eyed Mary, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the tips of its stems. The plant has slender, thread-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
