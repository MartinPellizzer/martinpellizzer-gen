    "intro": "Hyphaene multiformis subsp. rovumensis, commonly known as the Rovuma double coconut, is a rare and unique palm species native to the coastal regions of Mozambique. It is characterized by its distinctive, large, double coconut fruits that are highly valued for their ornamental and cultural significance. The plant has a robust trunk and produces long, pinnate leaves that contribute to its tropical appearance. It thrives in sandy soils near the coast and is adapted to salt spray conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
