    "intro": "Hypoestes pulchra, commonly known as the \"Magic Beanplant,\" is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that come in shades of red, pink, and white, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually green with a slightly hairy texture. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are clustered in racemes. Hypoestes pulchra is well-suited for indoor cultivation and thrives in bright, indirect light with well-draining soil."
