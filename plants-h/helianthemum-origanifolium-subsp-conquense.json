    "intro": "Helianthemum origanifolium subsp. conquense, commonly known as the Canary Islands rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a low-growing shrub with small, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its gray-green foliage. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
