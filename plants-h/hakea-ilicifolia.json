    "intro": "Hakea ilicifolia, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces cylindrical, yellowish flower spikes that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and drought-resistant features make it well adapted to coastal and sandy environments. Hakea ilicifolia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
