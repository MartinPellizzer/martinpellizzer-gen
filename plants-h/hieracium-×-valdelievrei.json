It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow, daisy-like flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Hieracium piloselloides and Hieracium aurantiacum. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in natural habitats."
