    "intro": "Helenium litorale, commonly known as sea helenium, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of North America. It is characterized by its bright orange to red ray florets and yellow disk florets, which resemble a daisy. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the shorelines. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize coastal dunes, making it an important plant for erosion control. Helenium litorale is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
