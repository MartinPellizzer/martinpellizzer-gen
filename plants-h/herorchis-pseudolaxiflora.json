    "intro": "Herorchis pseudolaxiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its specialized root system that forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to its habitat specificity, it is often found in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil."
