    "intro": "Hypolepis sanguinea, commonly known as the red-stemmed sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a reddish hue on the underside. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist, rocky substrates. Hypolepis sanguinea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
