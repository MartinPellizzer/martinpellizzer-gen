    "intro": "Hippotis lasseri, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in shallow, still waters such as ponds and ditches, where it can anchor itself to submerged vegetation. Its flowers are usually white or pale purple, with distinctive spurred petals that aid in pollination by insects. Hippotis lasseri is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the nutrients obtained from captured prey."
