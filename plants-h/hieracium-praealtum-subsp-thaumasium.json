    "intro": "Hieracium praealtum subsp. thaumasium, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
