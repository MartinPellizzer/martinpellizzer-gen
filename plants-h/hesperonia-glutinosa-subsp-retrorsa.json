It is characterized by its erect growth habit and hairy stems, which contribute to its sticky texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, enhancing its distinctive appearance. This subspecies is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky areas."
