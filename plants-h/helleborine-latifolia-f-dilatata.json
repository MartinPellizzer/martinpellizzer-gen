    "intro": "Helleborine latifolia f. dilatata, commonly known as the broad-leaved helleborine, is a perennial orchid belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces striking, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive spurred lip, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Native to Europe, it thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it a notable component of its native habitat."
