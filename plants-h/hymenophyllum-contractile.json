    "intro": "Hymenophyllum contractile, commonly known as the contracted moss, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is a small, delicate plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a prostrate, creeping growth habit with narrow, overlapping leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. Its spore-producing structures, called sorocarps, are borne on the underside of the leaves and are adapted for dispersal in humid conditions. Hymenophyllum contractile is known for its ability to contract its leaves in response to changes in humidity, a unique adaptation that helps it conserve moisture."
