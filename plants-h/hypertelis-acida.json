    "intro": "Hypertelis acida, commonly known as the sour hyperegg, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes trees and shrubs characterized by their aromatic bark and often toxic compounds. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, and its fruits are small, woody capsules containing several seeds. Hypertelis acida is known for its acidic sap, which can cause skin irritation, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine despite its potential toxicity. The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and pharmacological research."
