    "intro": "Hartia densivillosa, commonly known as the dense-hairscale orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, velvety pubescence covering its stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in greenish-yellow or brownish hues, and bloom during the rainy season. Hartia densivillosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
