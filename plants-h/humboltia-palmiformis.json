    "intro": "Humboltia palmiformis, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its robust, succulent stems and large, showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has palm-like leaves that are typically lobed and arranged in a rosette pattern, providing a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. Humboltia palmiformis plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small desert animals."
