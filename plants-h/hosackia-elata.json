    "intro": "Hosackia elata, commonly known as the tall hoary vetch, is a perennial legume native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, hairy leaves that are often tinged with silver or gray. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Hosackia elata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in prairies, meadows, and along stream banks. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil fertility in its native habitats."
