    "intro": "Hieracium bernense, commonly known as the Bernese hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium bernense is often considered an invasive species in non-native regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
