    "intro": "Hemionitis \u00d7 kochiana, commonly known as the hybrid rock fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Hemionitis arifolia and Hemionitis arifolia var. kochiana. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia, particularly in parts of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The plant features small, delicate fronds that are typically clustered at the base, with a rosette-like growth habit. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Hemionitis \u00d7 kochiana is often found in dry, open habitats such as slopes and gravelly areas."
