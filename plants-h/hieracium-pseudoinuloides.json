    "intro": "Hieracium pseudoinuloides, commonly known as the false mouse-ear hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
