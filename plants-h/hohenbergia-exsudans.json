    "intro": "Hohenbergia exsudans, commonly known as the sticky hohenbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, spathaceous inflorescence that ranges from red to orange, often with a sticky coating on the bracts. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green with white or silver markings. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hohenbergia exsudans is appreciated for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
