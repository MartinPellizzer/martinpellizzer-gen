    "intro": "Hebeclinium leucolithogenum, commonly known as the white limestone hebe, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in calcareous soils. It is native to specific regions with limestone substrates, typically found in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features compact growth with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue, with five petals and a distinct central throat. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
