    "intro": "Hypericum lobocarpum, commonly known as the Florida St. John's wort, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows in wetlands and along stream banks, preferring moist, sandy soils. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with prominent orange stamens, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a slightly hairy texture. Hypericum lobocarpum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
