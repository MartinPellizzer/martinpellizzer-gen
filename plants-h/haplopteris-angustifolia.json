    "intro": "Haplopteris angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wallr Fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in forest undergrowth. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds. Haplopteris angustifolia is known for its intricate and finely veined foliage, which contributes to its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens."
