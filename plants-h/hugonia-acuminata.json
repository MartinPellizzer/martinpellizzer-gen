It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.
