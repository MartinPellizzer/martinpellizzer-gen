    "intro": "Helichrysum schimperi, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that retain their color even when dried. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its small, needle-like leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Helichrysum schimperi is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting, vibrant appearance."
