    "intro": "Helianthus lenticularis, commonly known as the lensleaf sunflower, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, lens-shaped leaves and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. It produces small, achene fruits that are dispersed by wind, a common reproductive strategy among members of the sunflower family. Helianthus lenticularis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
