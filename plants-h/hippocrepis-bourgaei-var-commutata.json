    "intro": "Hippocrepis bourgaei var. commutata, commonly known as the commutated thyme-leafed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in shades of pink and white. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
