It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along riverbanks, thriving in moist, tropical environments. Its flowers bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies.
