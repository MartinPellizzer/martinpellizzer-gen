It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its yellow flowers, which bloom in early summer, are surrounded by a ring of pale yellow to white ray florets. Hieracium lucorum is also known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common weed in certain regions."
