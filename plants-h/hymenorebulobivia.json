    "intro": "Hymenorebulobivia, commonly known as the moonlight spire, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It features striking, waxy white petals that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a compact, upright growth habit with slender, ribbed stems and small, serrated leaves. Its flowers bloom only during the lunar cycle, typically under full moonlight, making it a subject of fascination for botanists and horticulturists. Due to its unique adaptations and limited habitat, Hymenorebulobivia is classified as an endangered species."
