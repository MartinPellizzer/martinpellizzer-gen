It features dense rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with white or pale blue tubercles. The plant produces small, star-shaped white flowers on slender stems during the growing season. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
