    "intro": "Holcus lanatus f. albovirens, commonly known as the white-stemmed cock's-comb, is a variant of the cock's-comb grass. It is characterized by its distinctive, fluffy, panicle-like inflorescence that is usually pink or purple, though the white-stemmed form has a lighter coloration. The plant is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and is a perennial species that thrives in full sun. The white-stemmed form is particularly notable for its unique coloration and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
