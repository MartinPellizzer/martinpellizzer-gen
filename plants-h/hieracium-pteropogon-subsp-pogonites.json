    "intro": "Hieracium pteropogon subsp. pogonites, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellowish to orange-yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its subspecies status reflects subtle differences in morphology compared to other Hieracium species."
