    "intro": "Hieracium fuscum subsp. permixtum, commonly known as the mixed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, while its flowering stems bear clusters of small, yellowish to brownish flowers. It produces seeds in achenes surrounded by bracts, which are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is notable for its hybrid nature, often occurring in areas where it interbreeds with other Hieracium species."
