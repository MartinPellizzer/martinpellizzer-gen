    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 issleri, commonly known as the hybrid buttercup, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is a natural hybrid between Hieracium auripunctatum and Hieracium piloselloides, resulting in a plant with distinctive yellow-orange flowers. The leaves are typically lobed and covered in fine hairs, and the plant often grows in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, making it a common sight in temperate regions. However, due to its invasive nature in some areas, it can pose a challenge to native plant communities."
