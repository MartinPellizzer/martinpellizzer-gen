    "intro": "Hieracium subcurvescens subsp. grantiophilum, commonly known as the Grant's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and yellow ray florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is known for its compact growth habit and is often found in meadows and open slopes at higher elevations. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its range."
