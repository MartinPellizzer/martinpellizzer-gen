    "intro": "Hakea macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited hakea, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces large, woody capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by animals and wind. Hakea macrocarpa is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species in coastal and sandy soils. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat."
