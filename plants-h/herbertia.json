    "intro": "Herbertia, commonly known as the rain lily, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Iridaceae. These plants are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are characterized by their attractive, showy flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. Herbertia species typically have strap-like leaves and produce clusters of bell-shaped or star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and are relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil. The plants are also known for their ability to thrive in partial shade and their drought tolerance once established."
