    "intro": "Heleochloa setulosa, commonly known as the hairy bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and hairy texture, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in prairie and wetland habitats. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, blue-green flowers. Heleochloa setulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
