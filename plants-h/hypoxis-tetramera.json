    "intro": "Hypoxis tetramera, commonly known as the four-leaf hypoxis, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its compact, grass-like foliage and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense clusters. The flowers are usually white or pale yellow and bloom in late summer to early autumn."
