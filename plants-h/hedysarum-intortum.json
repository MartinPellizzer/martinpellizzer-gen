    "intro": "Hedysarum intortum, commonly known as twisted vetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its seeds are encased in elongated, hairy pods that mature in late summer. Hedysarum intortum is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its nitrogen-fixing abilities in ecological restoration."
