    "intro": "Hakea yambulla, commonly known as the black hakea, is a shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems covered in short, stiff hairs. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Hakea yambulla is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland heathlands."
