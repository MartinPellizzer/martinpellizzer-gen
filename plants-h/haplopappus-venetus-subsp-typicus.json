    "intro": "Haplopappus venetus subsp. typicus, commonly known as the narrowleaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its small, yellow to orange flowers bloom in the summer, and it produces small, bristly pappus structures that aid in wind dispersal. The subspecies typicus is distinguished by its narrow leaves and compact growth habit."
