    "intro": "Hedyotis fluviatilis f. breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered water pepper, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, characterized by its small, clustered flowers and opposite leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, adapting to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions. Its leaves are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. This subspecies is distinguished by its shorter floral structures compared to the typical form of Hedyotis fluviatilis."
