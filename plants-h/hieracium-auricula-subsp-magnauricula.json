    "intro": "Hieracium auricula subsp. magnauricula, commonly known as the large-eared hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy, yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are broadly lance-shaped with prominent veins and often have a rough, hairy texture. The subspecies is distinguished by its larger ear-like structures at the base of the leaves compared to other Hieracium species."
