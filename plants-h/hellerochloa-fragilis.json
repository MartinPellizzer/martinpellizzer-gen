    "intro": "Hellerochloa fragilis, commonly known as the fragile grass, is a species of grass native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and sandy soils. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are arranged in spikelets. Due to its delicate structure, it is often overlooked but plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
