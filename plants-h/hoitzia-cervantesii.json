    "intro": "Hoitzia cervantesii, commonly known as the Cervantes' hoitzia, is a rare shrub native to the tropical regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a rough texture that aids in water retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hoitzia cervantesii is considered a species of conservation concern."
