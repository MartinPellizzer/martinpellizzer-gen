    "intro": "Hepetis maidifolia, commonly known as the sweet flag, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in the eastern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, grass-like foliage and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread through underground stems, and it thrives in moist, swampy environments. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. The plant plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and wildlife."
