    "intro": "Hieracium megalolepis, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, surrounded by a ring of pale green or white ray florets. Its leaves are typically basal, forming a rosette, and are covered in fine hairs. Hieracium megalolepis is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, and it can form dense colonies due to its aggressive growth habit."
