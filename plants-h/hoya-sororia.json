    "intro": "Hoya sororia, commonly known as the \"Baby Lace\" hoya, is a popular epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its waxy, fleshy leaves that are typically heart-shaped or oval in form. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink, which bloom in response to indirect light and proper care. Hoya sororia thrives in bright, indirect sunlight and well-draining soil, making it an ideal houseplant for beginners. Its slow growth and minimal maintenance requirements make it a favored choice among plant enthusiasts."
