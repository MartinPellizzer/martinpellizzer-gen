It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often resembling those of the common heliotrope. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Heliotropium carmanicum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open fields."
