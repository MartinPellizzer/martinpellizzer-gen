    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. pseudopsammogenes, commonly known as the sandhill hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to sandy soils in Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow flower heads and lance-shaped leaves. The subspecies is distinguished by its finely divided leaves and a more compact growth habit compared to other Hieracium species. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as dunes and grasslands, and is often found in coastal areas. Its botanical features make it an important plant for ecological studies in sandy environments."
