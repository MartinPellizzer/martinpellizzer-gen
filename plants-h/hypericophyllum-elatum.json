    "intro": "Hypericophyllum elatum, commonly known as the golden cupplant, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and large, palmately divided leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers arranged in clusters at the top of the stem, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often cultivated in regions with a warm climate."
