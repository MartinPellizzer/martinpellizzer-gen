    "intro": "Hechtia mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican hechtia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Hechtia mexicana is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or limestone soils."
