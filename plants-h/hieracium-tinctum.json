    "intro": "Hieracium tinctum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its yellow flowers bloom in the summer months, and the leaves are lance-shaped with a hairy texture. Hieracium tinctum is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
