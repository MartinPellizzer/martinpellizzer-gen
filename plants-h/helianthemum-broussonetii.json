    "intro": "Helianthemum broussonetii, commonly known as the rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a white, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
