    "intro": "Helianthemum scopulicola, commonly known as the rock sunflower, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, succulent-like leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. Its fleshy stems and leaves help it retain moisture in arid environments. Helianthemum scopulicola is well adapted to full sun and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in xeriscaped landscapes."
