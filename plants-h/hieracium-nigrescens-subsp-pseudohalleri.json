It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its clustered basal leaves and yellow to orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. It has a robust root system and can form dense colonies, often outcompeting other vegetation. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in some regions."
