    "intro": "Hetaeria cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as streams and marshes. The plant has delicate, heart-shaped fronds that are often submerged or floating. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate. Hetaeria cordata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygenation."
