    "intro": "Hordeum murinum var. depilatum, commonly known as mouse barley, is a flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is a low-growing, perennial species that typically forms dense mats on dry, disturbed soils. The plant has slender, hairless stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny grains. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is often found in rocky or sandy habitats and is adapted to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions."
