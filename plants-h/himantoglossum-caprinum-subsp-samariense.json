    "intro": "Himantoglossum caprinum subsp. samariense, commonly known as the Samarian gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkans. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or streamside habitats. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
