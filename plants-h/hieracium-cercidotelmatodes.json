    "intro": "Hieracium cercidotelmatodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Due to its invasive potential, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
