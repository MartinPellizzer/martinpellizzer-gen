    "intro": "Halleorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has modified stems that perform photosynthesis. Its flowers are striking, with white petals and a yellow lip, and it blooms once every few years. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Halleorchis is considered critically endangered."
