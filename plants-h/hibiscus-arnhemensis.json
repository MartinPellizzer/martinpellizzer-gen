It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves and stems that help it conserve water in dry environments. Hibiscus arnhemensis is often found in sandy soils and can thrive in full sun. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
