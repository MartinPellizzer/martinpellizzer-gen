    "intro": "Heliotropium kaserunense, commonly known as the Kaserun heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its flowers, which are usually pink or purple, open in response to sunlight, a trait known as heliotropism. It is often found in desert environments and is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to extreme climates."
