    "intro": "Hyacinthus comosus, commonly known as the garden hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It produces dense, spike-like clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers in early spring. The plant's leaves are long, narrow, and grass-like, emerging from a basal rosette of fleshy, scale-like leaves. Hyacinthus comosus thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its bulbs are also used in the production of hyacinth extract, which is valued in perfumery."
