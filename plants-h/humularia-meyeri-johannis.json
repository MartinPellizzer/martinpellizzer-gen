    "intro": "Humularia meyeri-johannis, commonly known as the Meyer-Johanns' humularia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Central America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense undergrowth. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the flowers range in color from white to pale pink, often with a subtle fragrance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
