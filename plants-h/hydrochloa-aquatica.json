    "intro": "Hydrochloa aquatica, commonly known as water clover, is a perennial aquatic plant native to freshwater environments. It features delicate, floating leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged or floating, adapted for pollination by water-dwelling insects. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving waters, contributing to water filtration and providing habitat for aquatic life. Hydrochloa aquatica is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and ornamental appeal."
