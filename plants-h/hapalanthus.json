    "intro": "Hapalanthus, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid regions of the Americas. These plants are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. Hapalanthus species are typically shrubs or small trees, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. They have thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss, and their deep root systems help them access groundwater. The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging climates."
