    "intro": "Hieracium trebevicianum subsp. loschniggianum, commonly known as the Loschnigg's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale yellow to white ray florets. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. It is known for its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its often damp habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in parts of its range."
