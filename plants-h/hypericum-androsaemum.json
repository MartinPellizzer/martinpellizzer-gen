It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, bead-like fruits that contain the seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its medicinal properties have been historically used for treating mild depression and anxiety."
