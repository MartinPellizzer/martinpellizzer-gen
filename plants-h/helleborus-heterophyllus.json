    "intro": "Helleborus heterophyllus, commonly known as the variable hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that vary in shape depending on the growth conditions. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Helleborus heterophyllus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. It is also noted for its toxicity, containing various cardiac glycosides that can be harmful if ingested."
