    "intro": "Hydrocotyle brevipes, commonly known as the small-leaved water pennywort, is a small aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often floating or partially submerged, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and bloom during the summer months. Hydrocotyle brevipes plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and fish."
