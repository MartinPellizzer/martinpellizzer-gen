    "intro": "Hordeum vulgare subsp. distichon, commonly known as two-row barley, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its two-row arrangement of grains on the spike, distinguishing it from other barley subspecies. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a cylindrical spike that bears the inflorescence. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is widely cultivated for its grains, which are used in brewing, food, and animal feed."
