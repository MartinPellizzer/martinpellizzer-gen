    "intro": "Hieracium formicarium, commonly known as the ant plant, is a species of flowering plant in the daisy family (Asteraceae). It is native to Europe and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. It has a low-growing habit and produces small, inconspicuous fruits called cypselae. The plant's name is derived from its association with ants, which are often seen on its stems and leaves."
