    "intro": "Hedysarum monophyllum, commonly known as the single-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has compound leaves with a single leaflet, giving it its common name, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Hedysarum monophyllum plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native ecosystems."
