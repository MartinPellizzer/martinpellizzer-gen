    "intro": "Habenaria nigricans, commonly known as the black orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its dark purple to black flowers, which are often adorned with intricate white or yellow markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually broad and strap-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers during the growing season. The orchid's botanical features make it both visually striking and ecologically significant in its native habitats."
