    "intro": "Hippophaestum vulgare, commonly known as the common sandthorn, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is characterized by its yellowish-orange flowers and small, tart fruits. The plant belongs to the family Elaeagnaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in arid environments. Its leaves are silvery-gray due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The fruits are often used in traditional medicine and for making jams and oils."
