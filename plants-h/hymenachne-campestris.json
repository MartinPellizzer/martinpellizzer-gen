    "intro": "Hymenachne campestris, commonly known as broadleaf watergrass, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of North America. It typically grows in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often floating or submerged, with a smooth, waxy surface. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to filter water. Hymenachne campestris plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and fish."
