    "intro": "Hymenophyllum apicale, commonly known as the apical hymenophyllum, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are densely packed on the underside of its leaves. Hymenophyllum apicale has a unique leaf structure with a thin, membranous lamina and a well-developed midrib. It is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions."
