It typically grows in calcareous soils, thriving in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plant features basal rosettes of broad, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. Its inflorescence consists of a single flower head surrounded by bracts, which are often hairy and glandular. This subspecies is notable for its adaptation to alkaline environments and its role in supporting local insect populations."
