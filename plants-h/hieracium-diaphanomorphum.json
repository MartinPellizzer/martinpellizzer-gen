It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
