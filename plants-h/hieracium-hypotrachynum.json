    "intro": "Hieracium hypotrachynum, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. It produces yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn, and its leaves are lance-shaped with rough, hairy surfaces. The plant is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common weed in disturbed areas."
