    "intro": "Hijmania alta, commonly known as the highland heather, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many shrubs and small trees adapted to acidic and nutrient-poor soils. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in cloud forests or mountainous areas with cool, moist conditions. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces small, dark berries as fruit. Hijmania alta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
