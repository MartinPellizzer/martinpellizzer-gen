    "intro": "Holoschoenus romanus subsp. holoschoenus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern South America. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, often forming dense tussocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, three-lobed flowers in late spring to early summer. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and is often found in association with other wetland flora. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role in stabilizing waterlogged soils."
