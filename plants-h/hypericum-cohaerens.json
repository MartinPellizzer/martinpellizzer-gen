    "intro": "Hypericum cohaerens, commonly known as the creeping St. John's wort, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features prostrate or semi-upright stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Hypericum cohaerens thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in meadows and woodland edges."
