    "intro": "Holttumochloa korbuensis, commonly known as the Korbu hill grass, is a perennial grass species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
