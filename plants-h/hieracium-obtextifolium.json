    "intro": "Hieracium obtextifolium, commonly known as the woolly yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant is distinguished by its dense, woolly pubescence covering the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
