    "intro": "Hieracium succulentifolium, commonly known as the succulent leaf hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf structures. The plant is notable for its fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. It produces yellow daisy-like flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, forming dense mats that can colonize rocky or disturbed soils."
