    "intro": "Histiopteris caudata, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Histiopteris caudata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
