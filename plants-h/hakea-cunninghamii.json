    "intro": "Hakea cunninghamii, commonly known as the pink hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and clusters of bright pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces woody, cone-like structures called follicles, which contain the seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. Hakea cunninghamii is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
