    "intro": "Heliconia irrasa subsp. undulata, commonly known as the wavy-leaf heliconia, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, brightly colored bracts that form a distinctive spiral structure, often resembling a torch. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that are clustered within the bracts. Its leaves are broad, waxy, and have a wavy margin, giving it its subspecies name. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and ability to thrive in humid, tropical environments."
