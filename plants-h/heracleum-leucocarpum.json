    "intro": "Heracleum leucocarpum, commonly known as white cowparnail, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and umbrella-like inflorescences. It is native to temperate regions of Asia and is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and riverbanks. The plant features hollow, ridged stems and large, pinnately divided leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, arranged in compound umbels, and it produces white, spherical fruits that are distinctive in appearance. Due to its toxic sap and potential allergenic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
