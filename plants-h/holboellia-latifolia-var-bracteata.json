    "intro": "Holboellia latifolia var. bracteata, commonly known as the broad-leaf holboellia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in inflorescences at the base of the leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a component of diverse tropical flora and its potential ecological value in supporting local biodiversity."
