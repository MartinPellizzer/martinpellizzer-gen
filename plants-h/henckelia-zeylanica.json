    "intro": "Henckelia zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and lance-shaped leaves that are glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth. Due to its aromatic wood, it has historical significance in traditional medicine and perfumery."
