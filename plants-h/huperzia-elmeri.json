    "intro": "Huperzia elmeri, commonly known as Elmer\u2019s huperzia, is a species of moss-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors. The plant has dimorphic leaves, with the lower leaves being smaller and more elongated, while the upper leaves are larger and more ovate. Huperzia elmeri is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in distinctive, terminal clusters on the upper leaves."
