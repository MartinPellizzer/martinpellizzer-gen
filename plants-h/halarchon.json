    "intro": "Halarchon, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to saline and windy environments. They produce showy, often blue or purple, composite flower heads that attract pollinators. The leaves are usually succulent and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Halarchon species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils."
