    "intro": "Hakea floripendula, commonly known as the hanging hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of bright red flowers that hang from the plant, creating an attractive display. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces woody, cone-like fruits that contain seeds covered in a fibrous coating. It is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
