    "intro": "Haemanthus baurii, commonly known as the red-hot poker, is a perennial evergreen plant native to South Africa. It features striking, sword-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy, with a reddish or purple tinge along the midrib. The plant produces tall, upright spikes of bright orange-red flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and drought tolerance."
