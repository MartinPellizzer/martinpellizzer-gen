    "intro": "Hieracium dollineri subsp. tridentinum, commonly known as the Trident-leaved Hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow ray flowers surrounded by a dense cluster of tubular florets, typical of the genus Hieracium. It thrives in rocky and dry habitats, often found in mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
