    "intro": "Hieracium liptoviense subsp. liptoviense, commonly known as the Liptovian hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the Carpathian region. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and forest edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped with rough, hairy surfaces, and the flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. This subspecies is notable for its limited distribution and is of interest to botanists due to its ecological and evolutionary significance."
