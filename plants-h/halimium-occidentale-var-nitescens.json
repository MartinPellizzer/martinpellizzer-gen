    "intro": "Halimium occidentale var. nitescens, commonly known as the silverleaf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, fuzzy hairs that reflect sunlight. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring, adding a delicate touch to its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its botanical features make it an attractive and drought-tolerant addition to native plant gardens."
