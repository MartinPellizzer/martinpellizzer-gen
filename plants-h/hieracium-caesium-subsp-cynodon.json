It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. Its bright yellow flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are usually basal, with a rough texture and a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
