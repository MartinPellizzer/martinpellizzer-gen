    "intro": "Huernia verekeri subsp. angolensis, commonly known as the Angolan moon cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its swollen, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is often cultivated for its unique appearance. This subspecies is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
