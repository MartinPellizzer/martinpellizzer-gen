    "intro": "Hemistylus odontophylla, commonly known as the slender sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in maritime climates. Its unique morphology allows it to withstand salt spray and strong winds typical of coastal environments. Hemistylus odontophylla is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
