    "intro": "Hermannia filifolia var. robusta, commonly known as the African violet or violet groundcover, is a low-growing, perennial herb native to tropical Africa. It features dense, rosette-like clusters of dark green, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of purple, pink, or white, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for shady garden beds or as a houseplant. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for both ornamental and horticultural purposes."
