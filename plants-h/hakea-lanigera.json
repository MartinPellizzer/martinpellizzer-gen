    "intro": "Hakea lanigera, commonly known as the silky hakea, is a shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its unique texture. Hakea lanigera is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid environments."
