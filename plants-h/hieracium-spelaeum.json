    "intro": "Hieracium spelaeum, commonly known as the cave hawkweed, is a rare and specialized plant species adapted to subterranean environments. It thrives in the dark, humid conditions of caves and rock crevices, where it relies on limited light sources for photosynthesis. The plant exhibits unique morphological adaptations, such as elongated stems and reduced leaf structures, to maximize light capture. Its flowers are typically small and yellow, arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Due to its restricted habitat, Hieracium spelaeum is considered an indicator species for cave ecosystems and is often protected due to its vulnerability."
