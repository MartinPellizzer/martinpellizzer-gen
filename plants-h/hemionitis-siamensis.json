    "intro": "Hemionitis siamensis, commonly known as the Siam hemionitis, is a rare and unique fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of a true fern, though it belongs to the family Hemionitidaceae, which is distinct from the more common fern families. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature common in many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis siamensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
