    "intro": "Hakea parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered hakea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems and small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Hakea parviflora is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
