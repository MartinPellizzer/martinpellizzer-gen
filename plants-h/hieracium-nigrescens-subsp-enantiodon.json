    "intro": "Hieracium nigrescens subsp. enantiodon, commonly known as the black-centred hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant features basal rosettes of dark green leaves with hairy surfaces, and it produces yellow flowers in late summer. Its flowers are arranged in a single head, with ray florets that are usually shorter than the disc florets. The subspecies is distinguished by its dark purple to black central disc, which contrasts with the yellow outer petals."
