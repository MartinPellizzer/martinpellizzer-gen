    "intro": "Hilsenbergia nemoralis, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and arid environments. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, often clustered flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to poor soil conditions and full sun exposure. Hilsenbergia nemoralis is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
