    "intro": "Hydnophytum oblongum, commonly known as the sticky vine or umbrella plant, is a unique epiphytic species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its ability to grow on other plants without deriving nutrients from them, instead relying on atmospheric moisture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that contains seeds enclosed in a sticky, viscous substance. This adaptation helps in seed dispersal by adhering to the fur of animals or the skin of humans."
