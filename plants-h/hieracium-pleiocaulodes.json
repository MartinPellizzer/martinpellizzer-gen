It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It has a rosette of basal leaves and produces yellow flowers that are surrounded by ray florets. Its hairy stems and leaves help it retain moisture in dry environments."
