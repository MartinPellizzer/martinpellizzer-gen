    "intro": "Herpestis humifusa, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features trailing stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats."
