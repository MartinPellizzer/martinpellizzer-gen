It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and produces clusters of purple to pinkish-white composite flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. It has a robust root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. The flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance."
