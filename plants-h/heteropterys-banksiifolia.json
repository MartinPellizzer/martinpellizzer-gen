    "intro": "Heteropterys banksiifolia, commonly known as the Banksia-leaved heteropterys, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. The plant is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that resemble those of the Banksia genus, hence its common name. It produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. The species is often found growing in moist, shaded environments along riverbanks and in dense understorey vegetation."
