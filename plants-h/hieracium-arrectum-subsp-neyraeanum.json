    "intro": "Hieracium arrectum subsp. neyraeanum, commonly known as the upright hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native plant species."
