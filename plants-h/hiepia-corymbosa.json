    "intro": "Hiepia corymbosa, commonly known as the golden bell vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its cascading clusters of yellow-orange bell-shaped flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, round, green fruits that turn red when mature, containing seeds enclosed in a fleshy aril. Hiepia corymbosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
