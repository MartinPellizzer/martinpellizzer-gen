    "intro": "Hornera lignosa, commonly known as the hardwood hornera, is a woody shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and small, pale green leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its hard, heavy wood is highly valued for carving and construction due to its durability and fine grain. Hornera lignosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
