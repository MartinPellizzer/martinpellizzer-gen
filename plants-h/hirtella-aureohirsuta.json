    "intro": "Hirtella aureohirsuta, commonly known as the golden-hairy hirtella, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
