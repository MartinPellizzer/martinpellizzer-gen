    "intro": "Hornstedtia scottiana, commonly known as the Scott's hornstedtia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Chile. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine, white pubescence. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Hornstedtia scottiana is considered endangered and is protected in its native region."
