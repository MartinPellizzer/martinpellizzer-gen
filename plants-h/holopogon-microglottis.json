    "intro": "Holopogon microglottis, commonly known as the small-glossy grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to brown flowers. Its leaves are covered with a fine layer of short hairs, giving them a slightly textured appearance. Holopogon microglottis is often found in moist, well-drained soils in open woodlands and along streambanks."
