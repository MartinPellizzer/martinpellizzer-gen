    "intro": "Hedera ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to southern Europe. It features dark green, leathery leaves with a distinctive reddish-brown underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to cover walls or ground. Hedera ferruginea is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
