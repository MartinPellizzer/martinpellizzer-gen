    "intro": "Helianthemum glaucum var. antiatlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It features compact, evergreen foliage with a bluish-gray hue, which helps it retain moisture in its arid, rocky habitat. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. It is well adapted to saline and windy conditions, making it a hardy species for coastal gardens. Its slow growth rate and drought tolerance make it an excellent choice for rockeries and xeriscaping."
