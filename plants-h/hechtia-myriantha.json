    "intro": "Hechtia myriantha, commonly known as the Mexican hechtia, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Hechtia myriantha thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat."
