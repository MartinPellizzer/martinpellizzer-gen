    "intro": "Hieracium scabrisetum, commonly known as the rough hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are rough and hairy, with a serrated edge, and its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. It is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
