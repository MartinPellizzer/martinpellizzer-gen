    "intro": "Herpestis parvula, commonly known as the small bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are slender and often submerged, while its stems may be floating or rooted. Herpestis parvula plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for microorganisms and invertebrates."
