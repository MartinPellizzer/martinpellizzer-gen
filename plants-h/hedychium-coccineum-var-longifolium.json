    "intro": "Hedychium coccineum var. longifolium, commonly known as the red flame ginger, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in clusters at the top of the stems. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
