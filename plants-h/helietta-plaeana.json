    "intro": "Helietta plaeana, commonly known as the marsh helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. It features a rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and other wetland environments. Helietta plaeana is known for its ability to form dense colonies, contributing to the ecological structure of its habitat."
