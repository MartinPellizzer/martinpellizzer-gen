    "intro": "Habrothamnus, commonly known as the silverweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae. These plants are typically annual or biennial herbs, characterized by their succulent, often hairy stems and leaves. They are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. The flowers are small and clustered, usually green or reddish, and the plant produces small, dry fruits. Habrothamnus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
