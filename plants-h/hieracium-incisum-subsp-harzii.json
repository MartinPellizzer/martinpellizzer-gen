It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its upright stems and basal leaves that are deeply lobed or incised. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
