    "intro": "Hieracium cryptadenum subsp. subvillosifolium, commonly known as the silky hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the dandelion family (Compositae) and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a single head, with ray florets surrounding a central disk. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
