    "intro": "Hypericum alpigenum f. fogarasense, commonly known as the Fogarasen St. John's Wort, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its yellow flowers and woody stems, typical of the Hypericaceae family. The plant thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often found on rocky slopes and meadows at high elevations. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, while its flowers consist of five petals and numerous stamens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
