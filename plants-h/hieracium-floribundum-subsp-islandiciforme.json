    "intro": "Hieracium floribundum subsp. islandiciforme, commonly known as the Islandica hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the British Isles. It typically grows in grassy habitats, such as meadows and pastures, and is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, flat-topped clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It has a fibrous root system and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in several regions."
