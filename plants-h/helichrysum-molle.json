    "intro": "Helichrysum molle, commonly known as the African daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange flowers, which are often arranged in compact, daisy-like clusters. The plant is perennial and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Helichrysum molle is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens and floral arrangements."
