    "intro": "Hypericum teretiusculum, commonly known as creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover."
