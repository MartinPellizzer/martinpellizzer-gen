    "intro": "Hermione \u00d7 teguliflora, commonly known as the hybrid evergreen shrub, is a botanical cross between Hermione and teguliflora species. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and compact growth habit, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a foundation plant. The plant typically produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, preferring a Mediterranean climate. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to tolerate drought and coastal conditions."
