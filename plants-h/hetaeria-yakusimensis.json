    "intro": "Hetaeria yakusimensis, commonly known as the Yakushima hetaeria, is a rare fern species native to the subtropical forests of Yakushima Island, Japan. It belongs to the family Hetaeriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that grow in a dense, compact form. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of ancient forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its leaves, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, Hetaeria yakusimensis is considered a vulnerable species."
