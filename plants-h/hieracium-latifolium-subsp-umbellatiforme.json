    "intro": "Hieracium latifolium subsp. umbellatiforme, commonly known as the broadleaf hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces yellow flowers in clusters, often arranged in a flat-topped umbel. It thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is sometimes grown in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
