    "intro": "Hemionitis ebenipes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a small aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that float on the water's surface. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that release spores into the water. Hemionitis ebenipes plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
