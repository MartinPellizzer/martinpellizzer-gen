    "intro": "Hakea banksii, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive cylindrical or conical flower spikes. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and ability to thrive in coastal environments make it well adapted to salty air and sandy soils. Hakea banksii is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
