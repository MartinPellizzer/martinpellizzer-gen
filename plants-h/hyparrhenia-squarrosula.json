    "intro": "Hyparrhenia squarrosula, commonly known as the rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Hyparrhenia squarrosula is adapted to withstand drought and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
