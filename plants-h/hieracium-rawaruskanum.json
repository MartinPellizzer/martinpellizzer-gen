    "intro": "Hieracium rawaruskanum, commonly known as the Rawaruskana hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in rocky and alpine environments. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically hairy and alternate, with a rough texture that helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions. Hieracium rawaruskanum is often found in high-altitude meadows and is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor soils."
