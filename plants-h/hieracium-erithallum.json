It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It features bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hieracium erithallum is also known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and natural settings."
