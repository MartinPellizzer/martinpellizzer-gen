    "intro": "Hibiscus cardiophyllus, commonly known as the heartleaf hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed and have a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom throughout the growing season. Hibiscus cardiophyllus thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
