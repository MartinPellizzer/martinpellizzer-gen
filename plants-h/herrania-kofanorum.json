    "intro": "Herrania kofanorum, commonly known as the Kofanorum mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of specific host trees in the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces fleshy, red berries that are a food source for various birds and mammals. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, Herrania kofanorum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species within its native range."
