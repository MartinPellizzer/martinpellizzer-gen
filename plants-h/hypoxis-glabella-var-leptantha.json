    "intro": "Hypoxis glabella var. leptantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved star grass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in a star-like pattern, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. This variety is closely related to other Hypoxis species and is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
