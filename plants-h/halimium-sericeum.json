    "intro": "Halimium sericeum, commonly known as the silky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has hairy, silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Halimium sericeum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
