    "intro": "Humboltia insignis, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features a basal rosette of fleshy, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh environment. Its flowers are yellow and occur in a single, upright stem, blooming in the spring. Humboltia insignis is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
