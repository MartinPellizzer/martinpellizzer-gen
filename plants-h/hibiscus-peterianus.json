    "intro": "Hibiscus peterianus, commonly known as the velvetleaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly Kenya and Tanzania. It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that are dark green and have a distinctive waxy texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a contrasting red throat. Hibiscus peterianus thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
