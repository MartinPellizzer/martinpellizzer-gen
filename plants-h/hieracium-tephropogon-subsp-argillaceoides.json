    "intro": "Hieracium tephropogon subsp. argillaceoides, commonly known as the clay-leaf hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often tinged with reddish or purple hues. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a single, elongated head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
