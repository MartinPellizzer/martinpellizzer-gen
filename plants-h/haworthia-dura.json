    "intro": "Haworthia dura, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are often marked with distinct white or yellow markings resembling a zebra's stripes. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy leaves and thriving in well-draining soil. It prefers bright, indirect light and minimal water, making it an ideal choice for indoor gardening. Haworthia dura is relatively low maintenance and adds a unique, decorative touch to any plant collection."
