    "intro": "Hieracium glaciale subsp. algidum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps and other mountainous areas. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence, adapted to withstand cold and windy conditions. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species of high-altitude ecosystems."
