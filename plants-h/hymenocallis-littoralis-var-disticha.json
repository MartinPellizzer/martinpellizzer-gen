    "intro": "Hymenocallis littoralis var. disticha, commonly known as the beach lily, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its strap-like, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clumps and its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow with a distinct greenish throat, and they emit a mild fragrance. This variety is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. It is a hardy perennial that thrives in full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
