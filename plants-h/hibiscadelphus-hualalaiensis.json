It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats on the slopes of Mauna Kea. It has small, ovate leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, conservation efforts are critical for its survival."
