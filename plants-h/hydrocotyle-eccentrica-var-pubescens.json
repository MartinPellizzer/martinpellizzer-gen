    "intro": "Hydrocotyle eccentrica var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months, typically in clusters at the water's surface. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily in shallow, still waters. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
