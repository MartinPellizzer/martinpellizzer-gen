    "intro": "Histiopteris alte-alpina, commonly known as the Alpine Histiopteris, is a fern native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and southern China. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are typically light green to yellowish in color. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds. Histiopteris alte-alpina plays a role in stabilizing soil in its mountainous environment and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme climates."
