    "intro": "Helianthemum glaucum var. longepedunculatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed sandverbena, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features silver-green foliage with a powdery bloom, giving it a distinctive, almost frost-covered appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in dense, elongated inflorescences, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and coastal gardens."
