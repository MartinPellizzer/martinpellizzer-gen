It is characterized by its large, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant thrives in high humidity and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Its pitchers are typically green with red or orange markings, enhancing its visual appeal. This variant is prized by collectors for its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
