    "intro": "Hieracium niviferum, commonly known as the snow devil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, giving it a frost-like appearance. Its flowering stems rise above the foliage, bearing yellow daisy-like flowers with white ray florets. Hieracium niviferum is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
