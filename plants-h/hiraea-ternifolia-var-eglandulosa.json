It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet having a glandular surface that secretes a sticky substance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its unique glandular features make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
