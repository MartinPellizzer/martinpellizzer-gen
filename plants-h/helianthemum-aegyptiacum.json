It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its branches. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
