    "intro": "Hieracium subpatulum, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves and its yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
