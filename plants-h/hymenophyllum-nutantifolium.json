    "intro": "Hymenophyllum nutantifolium, commonly known as the wandering fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Australia. It features delicate, overlapping, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant's fronds are typically pendulous, giving it a trailing appearance, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the leaves and are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium. Hymenophyllum nutantifolium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and air-purifying qualities."
