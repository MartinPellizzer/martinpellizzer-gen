    "intro": "Helianthemum cordi, commonly known as the heartleaf rockrose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, leathery leaves that are heart-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant."
