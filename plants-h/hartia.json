    "intro": "Hartia, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. Hartia species are characterized by their compact, evergreen foliage and delicate, often fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plants typically grow on rock faces or in crevices, showcasing adaptations to harsh, nutrient-poor conditions. Their unique morphology and ecological niche make them an important part of the local flora."
