    "intro": "Hoya venusta, commonly known as the \"Wax Plant\" or \"Porcelain Flower,\" is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, ovate leaves that are often variegated with white or cream markings. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink, blooming during the summer months. Hoya venusta thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
