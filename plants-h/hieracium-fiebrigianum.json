    "intro": "Hieracium fiebrigianum, commonly known as the Fiebrig's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a hairy texture. Hieracium fiebrigianum is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
