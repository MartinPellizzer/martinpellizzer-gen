    "intro": "Haworthia maculata, commonly known as the Zebra Cactus, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features a compact rosette of thick, fleshy leaves with distinctive white or yellow markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves to survive drought conditions. It produces small, white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. Haworthia maculata is popular as a low-maintenance houseplant due to its attractive appearance and ease of care."
