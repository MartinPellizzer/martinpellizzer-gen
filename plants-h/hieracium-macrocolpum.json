    "intro": "Hieracium macrocolpum, commonly known as the large-lobed hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped with rough, hairy surfaces, and the flowers are yellow with prominent central disks. Hieracium macrocolpum is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
