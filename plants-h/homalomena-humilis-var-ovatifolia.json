It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a smooth texture. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that are usually yellow or orange, emerging from the leaf axils. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in both indoor and outdoor gardens."
