    "intro": "Hieracium mougeotii subsp. sonchoides, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate, with hairy surfaces, and produces yellow flowers in clusters. Its inflorescence consists of ray flowers surrounded by disk flowers, typical of the Asteraceae family. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter stature and more compact growth compared to other Hieracium species."
