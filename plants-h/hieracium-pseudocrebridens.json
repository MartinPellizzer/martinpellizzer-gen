    "intro": "Hieracium pseudocrebridens, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Hieracium pseudocrebridens is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
