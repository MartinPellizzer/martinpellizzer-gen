    "intro": "Hymenophyllum inclinatum, commonly known as the leaning fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Australia. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters long. The plant's spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its intricate leaf structure and unique growth habit make it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
