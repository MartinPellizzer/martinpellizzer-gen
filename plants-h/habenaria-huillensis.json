It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the soil. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and limited distribution."
