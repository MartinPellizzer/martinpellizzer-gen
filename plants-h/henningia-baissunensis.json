    "intro": "Henningia baissunensis, commonly known as the Baissun henningia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, often covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Henningia baissunensis is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils."
