    "intro": "Hypericum scabrum, commonly known as rough St. John's wort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features small, yellow flowers that bloom from June to August. The plant has rough, hairy leaves and is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It is part of the Hypericaceae family and is known for its medicinal properties, though its use is less common than other St. John's wort species. The plant's name reflects both its rough texture and its historical association with the martyr Saint John."
