    "intro": "Hieracium levicaule subsp. subeuroum, commonly known as the European meadow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped cluster. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
