    "intro": "Hieracium furcatum var. hypopolium, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically features upright, hairy stems with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
