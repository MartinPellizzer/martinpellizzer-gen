    "intro": "Hieracium munduliforme, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces numerous yellow composite flowers. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and woodland edges. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread vegetatively. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
