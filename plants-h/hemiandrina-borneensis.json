    "intro": "Hemiandrina borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean hemiandrina, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and showy white flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory species, thriving in the humid and shaded conditions of the tropical forest floor. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
