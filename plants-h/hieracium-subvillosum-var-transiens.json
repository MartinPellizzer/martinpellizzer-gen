    "intro": "Hieracium subvillosum var. transiens, commonly known as the wandering buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It features a basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Due to its variability and widespread distribution, it is considered a common and adaptable species within the genus Hieracium."
