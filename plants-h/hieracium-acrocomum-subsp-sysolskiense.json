    "intro": "Hieracium acrocomum subsp. sysolskiense, commonly known as the Siberian hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the colder regions of Eastern Europe and Siberia. It typically grows in moist, sandy or loamy soils, often in open habitats such as meadows and tundra. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves and produces yellow flowers in the summer, which are arranged in a single head at the end of each stem. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain heat and moisture in its harsh environment. This subspecies is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and medicinal potential in traditional herbal medicine."
