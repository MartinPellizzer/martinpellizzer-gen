It belongs to the family Iridaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense clumps. Helonias thibetica thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the cold, high-altitude environments of its native habitat."
