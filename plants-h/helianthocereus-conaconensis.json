    "intro": "Helianthocereus conaconensis, commonly known as the Conacona night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with ribbed stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its flowers are followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible and have a sweet, tangy flavor. The plant is well adapted to hot, dry environments and has a slow growth rate, making it a striking and resilient desert species."
