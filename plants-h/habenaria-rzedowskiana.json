    "intro": "Habenaria rzedowskiana, commonly known as the Rzedowska's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually clustered in racemes and have a distinctive, intricate structure typical of the Orchidaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
