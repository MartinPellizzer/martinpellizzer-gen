    "intro": "Harpagonella palmeri var. arizonica, commonly known as Arizona harpagonella, is a rare flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought and high temperatures. Its leaves are finely divided and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of ecological health in its native range."
