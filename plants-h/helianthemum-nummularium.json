    "intro": "Helianthemum nummularium, commonly known as the silver carpet cushion plant, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, rounded, silver-gray leaves that form a mat-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are typically borne on short stalks above the foliage. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
