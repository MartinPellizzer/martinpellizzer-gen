    "intro": "Hedysarum mackenziei var. pabulare, commonly known as Mackenzie's needlepod, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces distinctive, narrow pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
