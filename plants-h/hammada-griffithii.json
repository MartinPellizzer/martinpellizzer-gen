    "intro": "Hammada griffithii, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a shrub native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are small, hairy, and adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration. The plant's thick, fleshy stems and roots help it store water, making it well-suited for desert conditions."
