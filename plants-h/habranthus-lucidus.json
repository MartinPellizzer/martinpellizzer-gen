    "intro": "Habranthus lucidus, commonly known as the shining bellflower, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant produces small, round, greenish-white fruits called capsules, which contain the seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
