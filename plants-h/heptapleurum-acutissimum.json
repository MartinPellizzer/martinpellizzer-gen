It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers followed by red berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in shaded to partially sunny environments and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its hardy nature makes it suitable for various climates, though it prefers moist, well-drained soil."
