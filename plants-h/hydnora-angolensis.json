    "intro": "Hydnora angolensis, commonly known as the Angolan hydnora, is a parasitic plant found primarily in southern Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis, relying entirely on its host plants for nutrients. The plant produces a distinctive, fleshy, and often foul-smelling structure that serves as a pollination mechanism. It is notable for its unique morphology, with no leaves, stems, or roots, and is often found growing inside the stems of its host. Due to its specialized lifestyle and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
