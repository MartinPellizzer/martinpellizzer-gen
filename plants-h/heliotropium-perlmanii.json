    "intro": "Heliotropium perlmanii, commonly known as the desert heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, succulent shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features fleshy, opposite leaves that are often bluish-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Heliotropium perlmanii is well-suited to xerophytic conditions and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
