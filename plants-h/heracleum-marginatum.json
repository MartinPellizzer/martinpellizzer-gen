    "intro": "Heracleum marginatum, commonly known as the white cow parsley, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant grows up to 1.5 meters tall and thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Its stems are hollow and often have a distinctive purple tinge, while its roots are fibrous and deep-reaching. It is important to note that while it is not as toxic as some related species, it can cause skin irritation in some individuals."
