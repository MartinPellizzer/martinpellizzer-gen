    "intro": "Hieracium degenianum, commonly known as the Degen's hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow-orange composite flowers that attract pollinators. Native to Europe, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, and its flowers are typically arranged in a single head. It is considered a weed in some regions due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
