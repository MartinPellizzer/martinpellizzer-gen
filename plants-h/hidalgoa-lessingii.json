It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a fibrous root system adapted to arid environments, allowing it to store water efficiently. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, reducing water loss through transpiration. Hidalgoa lessingii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert and semi-desert regions."
