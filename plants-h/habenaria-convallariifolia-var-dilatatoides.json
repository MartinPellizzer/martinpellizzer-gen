    "intro": "Habenaria convallariifolia var. dilatatoides, commonly known as the broad-leaf marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant has slender, erect stems with several oval, fleshy leaves that are often broader than those of the typical species. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and arranged in a spike, with a distinctive lip that is often broader than the other petals. This variant is notable for its adaptability to wetland conditions and its role in local ecosystems."
