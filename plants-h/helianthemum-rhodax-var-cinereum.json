It features compact, mat-forming growth with silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant. This variety is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
