    "intro": "Hypoxis caespitosa, commonly known as the African winterbloom, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a dense, grass-like rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that form a tight cluster at the base. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer to early autumn, which are arranged in a short inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Hypoxis caespitosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
