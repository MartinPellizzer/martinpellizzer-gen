    "intro": "Haplophyllum rubrum, commonly known as the red-flowered rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and arid regions of the Mediterranean. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to deep red, typically blooming in spring. The plant has a compact growth habit with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in loose, rocky soils. Haplophyllum rubrum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
