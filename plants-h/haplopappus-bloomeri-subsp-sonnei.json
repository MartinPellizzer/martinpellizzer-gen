    "intro": "Haplopappus bloomeri subsp. sonnei, commonly known as the Sonne's hairyfruit, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a perennial herb characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces fluffy, white pappus structures that aid in wind pollination. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to drought conditions and rocky habitats."
