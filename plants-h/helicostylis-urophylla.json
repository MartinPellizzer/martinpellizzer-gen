    "intro": "Helicostylis urophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf helicostylis, is a species of flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants characterized by their spadix and spathe flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often with a waxy coating, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered around a spadix. Helicostylis urophylla is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
