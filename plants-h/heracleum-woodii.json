    "intro": "Heracleum woodii, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall, invasive plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features large, umbrella-like compound leaves and can grow up to 5 meters in height. The plant produces white, clustered flowers and has a milky, toxic sap that can cause severe skin irritation. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a significant ecological concern. It is often found near waterways and in disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates."
