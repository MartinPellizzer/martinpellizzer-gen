    "intro": "Hedera polyacantha, commonly known as the giant ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to parts of Asia. It features dark green, glossy leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate in form. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forests or rocky areas. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in certain regions."
