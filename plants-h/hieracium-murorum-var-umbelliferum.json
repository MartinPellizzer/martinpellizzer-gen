    "intro": "Hieracium murorum var. umbelliferum, commonly known as the umbrella hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and can form dense mats. Its leaves are lance-shaped with hairy surfaces, and the flowers are yellow with a distinctive, umbrella-like arrangement of ray florets. It is considered a perennial weed and can spread readily through vegetative propagation."
