    "intro": "Hyparrhenia multiplex, commonly known as hairy flat sedge, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, clumping growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wet or seasonally flooded soils, making it common in marshy areas and along riverbanks. Hyparrhenia multiplex is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
