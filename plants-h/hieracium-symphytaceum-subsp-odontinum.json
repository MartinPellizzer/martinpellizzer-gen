    "intro": "Hieracium symphytaceum subsp. odontinum, commonly known as the toothed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves that are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, with a distinctive central stem bearing yellow disk flowers. Its flowers are arranged in a single head, surrounded by pale green to yellowish ray florets. The subspecies is characterized by its finely toothed leaf margins, which give it its common name."
