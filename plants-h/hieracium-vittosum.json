    "intro": "Hieracium vittosum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow to orange flowers in clusters. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and roadsides. It has a fibrous root system and can spread through both seeds and rhizomes. Due to its aggressive growth, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
