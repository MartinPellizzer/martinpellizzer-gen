    "intro": "Helianthemum viscarioides, commonly known as the sticky rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has glandular hairs that give it a sticky texture, which helps in water retention. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping."
