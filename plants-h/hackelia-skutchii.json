    "intro": "Hackelia skutchii, commonly known as the Skutch's monkeyflower, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Hackelia skutchii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local pollinator populations."
