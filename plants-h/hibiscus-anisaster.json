It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep pink, often with a prominent yellow center. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and is adapted to thrive in hot, dry conditions. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Hibiscus anisaster is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
