It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring well-drained, sunny conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, while its flowers are yellow with a bluish tinge, giving it its common name. Hieracium glaucochroum is often considered a weed but can play a role in supporting local pollinators."
