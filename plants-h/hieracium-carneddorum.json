    "intro": "Hieracium carneddorum, commonly known as the Welsh mountain hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to the British Isles, particularly Wales. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy habitats, such as meadows and woodland edges, and thrives in well-drained soils. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
