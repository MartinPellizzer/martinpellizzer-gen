    "intro": "Helianthus instabilis, commonly known as the unstable sunflower, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its large, yellow, daisy-like flowers and robust, hairy stems. It produces both ray and disk flowers, typical of the Asteraceae family, and has a short life cycle, often completing its growth within a single growing season. Helianthus instabilis is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
