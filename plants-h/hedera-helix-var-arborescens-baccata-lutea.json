    "intro": "Hedera helix var. arborescens-baccata-lutea, commonly known as the golden ivy, is a variant of the common ivy that exhibits unique botanical characteristics. It is distinguished by its vibrant yellow variegation, which is more pronounced in varietal forms like arborescens, baccata, and lutea. This plant typically has heart-shaped leaves with a waxy texture and can grow as a climbing or trailing vine. It thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments and prefers moist, well-drained soil. The golden ivy is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to climb trellises or walls."
