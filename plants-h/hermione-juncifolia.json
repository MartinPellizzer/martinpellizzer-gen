It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown in color, arranged in spike-like clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
