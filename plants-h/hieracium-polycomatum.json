It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense colonies, making it both a common weed and a subject of ecological study."
