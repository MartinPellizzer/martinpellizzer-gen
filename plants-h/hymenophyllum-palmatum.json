    "intro": "Hymenophyllum palmatum, commonly known as the lace fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble lace, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually less than 10 centimeters long and have a unique, intricate structure with closely spaced, tooth-like margins. Hymenophyllum palmatum thrives in high humidity and requires consistent moisture and indirect light for optimal growth."
