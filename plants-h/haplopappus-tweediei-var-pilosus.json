    "intro": "Haplopappus tweediei var. pilosus, commonly known as the hairy leaf desert parsley, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its silvery-green, hairy leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to dry environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh, sandy soils. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its propagation in open, disturbed habitats. This variety is distinguished by its dense, woolly foliage, which helps reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight."
