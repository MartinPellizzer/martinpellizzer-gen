    "intro": "Hoya sumatrana, commonly known as the \"Wax Plant\" or \"Porcelain Flower,\" is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of star-shaped, fragrant flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tropical rainforests. Hoya sumatrana produces showy, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a subtle fragrance. It is popular among succulent enthusiasts due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
