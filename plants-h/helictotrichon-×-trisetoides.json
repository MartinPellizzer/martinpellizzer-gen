It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, meadows, and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
