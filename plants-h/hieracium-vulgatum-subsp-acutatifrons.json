    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. acutatifrons, commonly known as the sharp-fruited hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, with the stem bearing smaller, alternate leaves. Its flowers are yellow, with a single central ray floret and numerous disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. The subspecies is distinguished by its sharply pointed fruiting structures, which aid in seed dispersal."
