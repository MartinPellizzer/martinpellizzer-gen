    "intro": "Harpullia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf harpullia, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale yellow, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. Harpullia angustifolia is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its hard timber. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
