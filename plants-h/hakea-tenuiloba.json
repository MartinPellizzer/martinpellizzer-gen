It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, typically blooming in spring. Hakea tenuiloba is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant. It plays an important role in providing habitat and nectar for native wildlife."
