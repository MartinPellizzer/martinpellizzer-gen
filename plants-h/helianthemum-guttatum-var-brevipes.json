It features dense clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact form and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
