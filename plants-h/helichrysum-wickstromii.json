    "intro": "Helichrysum wickstromii, commonly known as the Cape gold flower, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, bright yellow to orange flowers that resemble small sunflowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to retain its color even after flowering, giving it a long-lasting appearance."
