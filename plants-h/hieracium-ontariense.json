    "intro": "Hieracium ontariense, commonly known as Ontario hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and stream banks. It has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy, with yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Ontario hawkweed is often found in disturbed sites and can form dense colonies, making it a common but sometimes invasive species in its native range."
