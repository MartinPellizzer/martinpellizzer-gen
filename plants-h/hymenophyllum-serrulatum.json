    "intro": "Hymenophyllum serrulatum, commonly known as the serrulate fern, is a small, delicate moss-like fern native to the wet tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely serrated, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically growing on rocks or tree trunks in humid forests. Its intricate leaf structure and unique appearance make it a popular subject in botanical studies and horticulture. Due to its sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for high humidity and stable microclimates."
