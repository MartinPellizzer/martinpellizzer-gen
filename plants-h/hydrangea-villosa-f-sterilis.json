    "intro": "Hydrangea villosa f. sterilis, commonly known as the sterile form of the hairy hydrangea, is a botanical variant characterized by its reduced flowering capability. This cultivar typically exhibits dense, dark green foliage with a velvety texture due to its hairy stems and leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. The plant's ornamental value lies primarily in its foliage rather than its flowers. It is often used in horticultural settings for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
