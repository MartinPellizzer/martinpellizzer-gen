    "intro": "Hordeum vulgare var. tetrapallidum, commonly known as the pale barley, is a variant of barley characterized by its pale yellow grains. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence is a panicle, bearing small, two-lobed spikelets that contain the seeds. This variety is often cultivated for its grain, which is used in malting and brewing, though it is less common than other barley types."
