    "intro": "Hieracium grandidens, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features upright, hairy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its showy yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
