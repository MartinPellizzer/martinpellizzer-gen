    "intro": "Heliotropium callosum, commonly known as the sticky heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple, often resembling those of the true heliotropes. The plant produces sticky secretions on its leaves and stems, which can attract various insects and contribute to its ecological interactions. It typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in open habitats such as roadsides and fields. Heliotropium callosum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of conditions."
