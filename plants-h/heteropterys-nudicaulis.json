It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its smooth, hairless stems and leaves make it distinct within its genus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests."
