    "intro": "Hydrocotyle rubescens, commonly known as the red sandalwood or red marsh mallow, is a perennial herb native to wetlands and marshy areas in the Americas. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with heart-shaped leaves that often have a reddish tinge, especially when mature. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common colonizer of disturbed wetland habitats. Hydrocotyle rubescens is often found in shallow water or saturated soils, contributing to the ecological diversity of riparian zones."
