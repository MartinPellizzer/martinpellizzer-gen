    "intro": "Haworthia poellnitziana, commonly known as the Zulu bulb, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often adorned with white or pale markings. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers on tall, slender stems during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
