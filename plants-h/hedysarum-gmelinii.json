    "intro": "Hedysarum gmelinii, commonly known as the Siberian milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the cold climates of Asia, including Siberia and Mongolia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves composed of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Hedysarum gmelinii is adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often found in steppe and rocky soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
