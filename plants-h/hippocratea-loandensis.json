    "intro": "Hippocratea loandensis, commonly known as the Loand\u00e9 hippocratea, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to several meters. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in racemes, and are typically white or pale in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
