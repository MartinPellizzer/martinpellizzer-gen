    "intro": "Hieracium ruminosum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it is native to Europe and parts of Asia. It has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Hieracium ruminosum is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
