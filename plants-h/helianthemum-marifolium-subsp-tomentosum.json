    "intro": "Helianthemum marifolium subsp. tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, evergreen foliage covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
