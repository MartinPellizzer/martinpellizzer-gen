It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or red, followed by capsule fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and ornamental horticulture."
