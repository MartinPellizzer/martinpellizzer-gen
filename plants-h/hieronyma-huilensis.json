    "intro": "Hieronyma huilensis, commonly known as the Huil\u00e9n tree, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in Colombia and Ecuador. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or white, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature, contributing to its natural distribution in the wild."
