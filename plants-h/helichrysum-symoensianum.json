    "intro": "Helichrysum symoensianum, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that remain vibrant even when dried. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Its foliage is covered in fine, silvery hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Helichrysum symoensianum is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance."
