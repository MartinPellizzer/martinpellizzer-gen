    "intro": "Hydrilla angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaf hydrilla, is a submersible aquatic plant native to Asia. It has long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Hydrilla angustifolia can grow rapidly, making it an aggressive invasive species in some regions. Its dense growth can alter water quality and outcompete native plants for resources."
