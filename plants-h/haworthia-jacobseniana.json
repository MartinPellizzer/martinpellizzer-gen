It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically green with white or pale blue markings. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
