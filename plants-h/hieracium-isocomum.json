    "intro": "Hieracium isocomum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are surrounded by a ring of pale yellow to white ray florets. Hieracium isocomum is often found in clusters and can spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
