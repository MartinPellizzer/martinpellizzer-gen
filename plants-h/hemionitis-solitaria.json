    "intro": "Hemionitis solitaria, commonly known as the solitary hemionite, is a rare and unique fern found primarily in the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hemionitis solitaria is considered a vulnerable species."
