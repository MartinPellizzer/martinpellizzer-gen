    "intro": "Heterosperma xanti, commonly known as the African waterwheel, is a perennial aquatic plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of broad, lance-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically emerging from the water. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in shallow waters, while its leaves provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Heterosperma xanti is often used in water gardens and ponds due to its ornamental appearance and ability to stabilize water ecosystems."
