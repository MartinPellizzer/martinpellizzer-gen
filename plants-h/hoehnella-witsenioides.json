    "intro": "Hoehnella witsenioides, commonly known as the Witsen's hoehnella, is a rare and striking member of the Acanthaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep purple, often with contrasting yellow markings. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hoehnella witsenioides is considered a conservation concern."
