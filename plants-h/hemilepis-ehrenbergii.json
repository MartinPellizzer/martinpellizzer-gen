    "intro": "Hemilepis ehrenbergii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Mexico and Central America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a yellow or orange center. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Hemilepis ehrenbergii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
