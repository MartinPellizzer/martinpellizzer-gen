    "intro": "Helwingia chinensis var. crenata, commonly known as the Chinese helwingia, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, opposite, ovate leaves with wavy margins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by unique, cup-like structures called cyathia. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its foliage and the subtle beauty of its inflorescences."
