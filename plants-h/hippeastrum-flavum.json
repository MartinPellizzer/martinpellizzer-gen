    "intro": "Hippeastrum flavum, commonly known as the yellow hurricane lily, is a species of amaryllid that originates from South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a distinctive red or purple throat. The plant produces strap-like, dark green leaves that are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native arid environment. It blooms in summer, producing clusters of flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hippeastrum flavum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil with adequate sunlight."
