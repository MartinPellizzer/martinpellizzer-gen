    "intro": "Hedysarum hedysaroides subsp. tschuktschorum, commonly known as the Tschuktschorum milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
