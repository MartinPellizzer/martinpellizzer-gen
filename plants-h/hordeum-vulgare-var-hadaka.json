It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikes and small, hard grains that are typically pale yellow to brown in color. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. It has been historically used in traditional agriculture and as a forage crop. Its botanical features make it distinct from other barley varieties, particularly in its morphology and ecological adaptability."
