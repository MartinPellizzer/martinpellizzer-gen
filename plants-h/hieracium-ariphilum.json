    "intro": "Hieracium ariphilum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hieracium ariphilum is known for its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry environments."
