    "intro": "Hieracium eliasii, commonly known as Elias's hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in a composite head. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in rocky and alpine environments. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. It is often found in open meadows and along rocky slopes at high elevations."
