    "intro": "Hypericum oliganthum f. parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved St. John's wort, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length, giving it its distinguishing appearance. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with prominent yellow stamens, typical of the Hypericaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
