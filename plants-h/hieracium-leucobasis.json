    "intro": "Hieracium leucobasis, commonly known as white hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, with white to pale yellow ray florets. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Hieracium leucobasis is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators."
