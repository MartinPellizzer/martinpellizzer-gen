It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. This perennial herb is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in the summer months. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant species."
