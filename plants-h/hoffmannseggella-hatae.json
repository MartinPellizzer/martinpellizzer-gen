    "intro": "Hoffmannseggella hatae, commonly known as the Hatae's hoffmannseggella, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Hoffmannseggella hatae is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
