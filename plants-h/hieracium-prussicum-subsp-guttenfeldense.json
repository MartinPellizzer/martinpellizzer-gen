It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellowish to orange-red flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It has alternate, rough-hairy leaves and produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
