    "intro": "Hieracium fruticetorum, commonly known as the shrubby hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright, bushy growth habit and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant features basal leaves that are often lobed or toothed, and its flowering heads are typically yellow or orange, consisting of numerous small florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats. Due to its aggressive growth, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
