The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Hakea eryngioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and flowering display."
