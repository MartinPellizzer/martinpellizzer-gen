    "intro": "Haematoxylum dinteri, commonly known as the Dinter's red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody, aromatic bark. The plant is known for its unique red coloration in its wood, which has historically been valued for its aesthetic and medicinal properties. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered threatened in its natural range."
