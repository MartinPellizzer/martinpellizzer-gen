    "intro": "Heuchera hallii var. grossularifolia, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada alumroot, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It features basal rosettes of elliptic, dark green to purple foliage that provide striking visual contrast. The plant produces upright clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its delicate, early blooming flowers."
