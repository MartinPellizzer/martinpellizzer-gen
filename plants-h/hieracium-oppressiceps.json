    "intro": "Hieracium oppressiceps, commonly known as the bent-headed hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, blue-green leaves and produces yellow flowers in dense, branched clusters. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant's stems are often prostrate or ascending, and its flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas."
