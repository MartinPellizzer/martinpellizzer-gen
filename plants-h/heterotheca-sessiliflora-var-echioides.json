    "intro": "Heterotheca sessiliflora var. echioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf blueweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant has linear, gray-green leaves that are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without stalks. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
