    "intro": "Hieracium macrodontum, commonly known as the large-headed hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are yellow with a central disk, and it produces achenes as its seeds. Hieracium macrodontum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
