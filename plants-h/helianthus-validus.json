    "intro": "Helianthus validus, commonly known as the swamp sunflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in wet, swampy environments and has heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with a prominent central disk, typical of the sunflower genus. It blooms from late spring to early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Helianthus validus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local ecosystems."
