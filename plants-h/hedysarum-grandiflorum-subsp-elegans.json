    "intro": "Hedysarum grandiflorum subsp. elegans, commonly known as the elegant peavine, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive, showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces slender, twisted pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Hedysarum grandiflorum subsp. elegans is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems where it fixes nitrogen in the soil."
