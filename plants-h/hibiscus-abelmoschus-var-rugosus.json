    "intro": "Hibiscus abelmoschus var. rugosus, commonly known as the Chinese okra or rough hibiscus, is a variant of the okra plant characterized by its hairy, rugged stems and leaves. It is native to Asia and is often cultivated for its edible flowers and pods, which are used in culinary applications. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, and thrives in warm, sunny climates. Its flowers are large, showy, and come in various colors, including pink, red, and white, making it a popular ornamental plant. The fruit, known as a capsule, contains numerous seeds and matures into a fibrous, edible pod similar to okra."
