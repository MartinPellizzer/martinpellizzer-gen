    "intro": "Hedysarum viscidum, commonly known as sticky vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, often sticky stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by cylindrical, pod-like fruits. Hedysarum viscidum is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is adapted to a variety of soil types. It has been used historically for forage and in traditional medicine."
