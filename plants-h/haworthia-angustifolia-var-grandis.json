    "intro": "Haworthia angustifolia var. grandis, commonly known as the broad-leaved Haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or yellowish markings. The leaves are broader than those of the typical angustifolia variety, giving it a more substantial appearance. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or yellow during the warmer months. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements."
