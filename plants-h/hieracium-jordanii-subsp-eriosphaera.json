    "intro": "Hieracium jordanii subsp. eriosphaera, commonly known as Jordan's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Hieracium jordanii subsp. eriosphaera is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
