    "intro": "Heinsia bussei, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with woody stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in the summer months. Heinsia bussei is adapted to survive in drought conditions, with deep roots and a high tolerance for heat and poor soil. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and landscaping in dry climates."
