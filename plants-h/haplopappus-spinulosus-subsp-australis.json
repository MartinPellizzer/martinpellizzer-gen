It is a small, annual herb with hairy, branched stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and dunes. Its distinctive spinose pappus, which aids in wind dispersal, is a key botanical feature."
