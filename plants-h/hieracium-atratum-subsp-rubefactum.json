    "intro": "Hieracium atratum subsp. rubefactum, commonly known as the red-stemmed hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its reddish-brown stems and leaves with a rough, glandular surface. It typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, and is often found in open habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
