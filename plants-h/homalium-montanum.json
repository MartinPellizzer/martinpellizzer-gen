    "intro": "Homalium montanum, commonly known as the mountain homalium, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly the Andean foothills. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in natural habitats."
