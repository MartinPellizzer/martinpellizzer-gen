    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. inaequidens, commonly known as the unequal hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellowish to reddish flower heads. The subspecies is distinguished by its irregularly shaped leaves and shorter, more compact growth habit compared to other hawkweed species. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive spreading habit, it is considered a potential weed in some regions."
