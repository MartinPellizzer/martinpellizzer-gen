    "intro": "Hemionitis windhamii, commonly known as the Windham's hemionitis, is a rare and delicate fern native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in crevices or on cliff faces. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
