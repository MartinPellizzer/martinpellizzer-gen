    "intro": "Hypolaena ramosissima, commonly known as the coralroot orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotrophic plant that obtains nutrients through its mycorrhizal associations with fungi. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in a dense spike. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swamps. Due to its specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of undisturbed forest ecosystems."
