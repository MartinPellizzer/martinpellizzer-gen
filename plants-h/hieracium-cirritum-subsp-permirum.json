    "intro": "Hieracium cirritum subsp. permirum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands, roadsides, and woodland edges. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowering heads are surrounded by a ring of pale yellow ray florets, which are sterile and serve to attract pollinators. The species is characterized by its slender stem and is often found in moist or calcareous soils."
