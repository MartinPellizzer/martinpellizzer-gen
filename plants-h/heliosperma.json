    "intro": "Heliosperma, commonly known as the sun spurge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. These plants are characterized by their succulent, often hairy leaves and showy, yellowish flowers that resemble a star. They are native to southern Africa and are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Heliosperma species typically have a basal rosette growth habit, which helps them conserve water. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their unique appearance."
