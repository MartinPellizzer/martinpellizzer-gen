    "intro": "Heracleum delphinense, commonly known as the water parsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a biennial or perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist or wet habitats such as marshes and stream banks. The plant features a tall, hollow stem that is often branched, with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its small white to greenish flowers are arranged in umbrella-shaped clusters, which attract pollinators like bees and flies. The plant is known for its strong, often unpleasant odor, which can be more pronounced when the leaves are crushed."
