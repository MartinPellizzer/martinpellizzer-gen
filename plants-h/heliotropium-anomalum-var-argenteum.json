    "intro": "Heliotropium anomalum var. argenteum, commonly known as silverleaf heliotropium, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found in sandy or limestone soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
