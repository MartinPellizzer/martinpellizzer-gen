    "intro": "Heliotropium eriocarpum, commonly known as the woolly heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, often resembling those of the true heliotropes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed sites. Heliotropium eriocarpum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
