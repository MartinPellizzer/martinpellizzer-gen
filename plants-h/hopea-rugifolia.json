    "intro": "Hopea rugifolia, commonly known as the rough-leaved ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing a single seed. Hopea rugifolia is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. It also plays an important role in the ecosystems of its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
