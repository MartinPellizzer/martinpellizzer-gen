    "intro": "Hypocalyptus calyptratus, commonly known as the golden rain tree, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its feathery, compound leaves that turn yellow in the fall, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, which bloom in the spring. Its bark is smooth and light gray, and it often has a spreading, umbrella-like canopy. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant seasonal display."
