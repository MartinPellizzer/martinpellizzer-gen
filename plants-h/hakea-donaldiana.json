    "intro": "Hakea donaldiana, commonly known as the Western Australian hakea, is a shrub native to the southwestern region of Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often appearing in late winter to early spring. Hakea donaldiana is adapted to arid and Mediterranean climates, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
