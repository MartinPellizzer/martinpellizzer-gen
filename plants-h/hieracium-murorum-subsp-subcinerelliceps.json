    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. subcinerelliceps, commonly known as the ash-gray hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and thrives in temperate climates. The plant has hairy, erect stems that can reach up to 50 cm in height, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, with ray florets that are shorter than the central disk florets. It is characterized by its distinctive ash-gray coloration on the underside of its leaves, which gives it its common name."
