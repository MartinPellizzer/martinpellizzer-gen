    "intro": "Hesperis pachyrhiza, commonly known as the broad-leaved scabious, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, lobed leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a common sight in rocky or gravelly habitats. Hesperis pachyrhiza is also known for its medicinal properties, historically used in traditional herbal remedies."
