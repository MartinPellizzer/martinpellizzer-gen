    "intro": "Hyparrhenia stolzii, commonly known as the African carpet grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with dense, fibrous rhizomes that form a thick mat on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous minute, three-angled spikelets. Its leaves are narrow, flat, and often covered with short, stiff hairs. Hyparrhenia stolzii is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in disturbed soils, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
