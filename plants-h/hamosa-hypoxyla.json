    "intro": "Hamosa hypoxyla, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets and produces small, yellowish-green flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate. Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in many regions."
