    "intro": "Hieracium irriguum subsp. frondosum, commonly known as the fronded hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant features basal rosettes of broadly lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. Its flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. The subspecies is distinguished by its elongated, frond-like leaves and is often found in wetter environments compared to other hawkweed species."
