    "intro": "Heterotropa tamaensis, commonly known as the Tama sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly found in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and clusters of white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils in coastal or inland habitats. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in well-drained environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
