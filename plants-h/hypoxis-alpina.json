    "intro": "Hypoxis alpina, commonly known as the alpine yellowstar, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, preferring well-drained environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette, while its stems are short and stout. Hypoxis alpina is often used in rock gardens and alpine collections due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
