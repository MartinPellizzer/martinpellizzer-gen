It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in moist, tropical environments and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions.
