    "intro": "Habenaria mosambicensis, commonly known as the Mozambique butterfly orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, butterfly-like flowers with pale pink to white petals and a distinctive yellow lip. It typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
