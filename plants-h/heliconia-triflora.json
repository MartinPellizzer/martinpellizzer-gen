    "intro": "Heliconia triflora, commonly known as the red heliconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, and is characterized by its striking, brightly colored bracts that resemble flowers. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white true flowers surrounded by long, spiral-shaped bracts. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy texture. Heliconia triflora is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its vibrant appearance and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
