    "intro": "Hyssopus officinalis var. decumbens, commonly known as creeping hyssop, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its aromatic qualities. This variety is often used in herbal medicine for its antiseptic and expectorant properties."
