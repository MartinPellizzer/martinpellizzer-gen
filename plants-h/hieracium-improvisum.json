    "intro": "Hieracium improvisum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped with hairy surfaces. It has a fibrous root system and can spread vegetatively through rhizomes. Hieracium improvisum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas."
