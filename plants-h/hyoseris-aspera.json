    "intro": "Hyoseris aspera, commonly known as roughleaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun. Its leaves are rough and hairy, giving it a distinctive texture, while its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. Hyoseris aspera is often considered a weed but can serve as a food source for certain pollinators."
