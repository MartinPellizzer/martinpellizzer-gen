    "intro": "Hypericum foliosissimum, commonly known as the broad-leaved St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in temperate climates. Its medicinal properties have been studied for their potential anti-inflammatory and antidepressant effects."
