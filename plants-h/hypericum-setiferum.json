    "intro": "Hypericum setiferum, commonly known as woodbine or St. John's wort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and opposite, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in fine, hairy glands, giving them a slightly rough texture. Hypericum setiferum is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, and it is valued for its ornamental appearance and historical medicinal uses."
