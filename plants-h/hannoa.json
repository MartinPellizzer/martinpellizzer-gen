    "intro": "Hannoa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The flowers are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, with five petals and numerous stamens. Hannoa species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and are often found in moist, shaded environments. They are sometimes considered invasive in certain areas due to their rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and rhizomes."
