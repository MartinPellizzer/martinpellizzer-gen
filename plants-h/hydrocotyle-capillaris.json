    "intro": "Hydrocotyle capillaris, commonly known as the water pennywort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and streams. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are often floating or partially submerged, with a delicate, feathery appearance. Its flowers are tiny, white, and clustered in umbels, and it produces small, dark seeds. Hydrocotyle capillaris plays a role in stabilizing water ecosystems and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
