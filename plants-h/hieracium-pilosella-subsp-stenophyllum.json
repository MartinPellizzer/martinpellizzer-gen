    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow composite flowers in summer, arranged in a single head with many small florets. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ability to form dense colonies, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
