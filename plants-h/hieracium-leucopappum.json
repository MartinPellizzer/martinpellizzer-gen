    "intro": "Hieracium leucopappum, commonly known as white pappus hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers consist of both ray and disk florets. The white pappus, a fluffy structure at the base of the flower, aids in seed dispersal by wind."
