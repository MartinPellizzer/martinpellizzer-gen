    "intro": "Hesperastragalus gambelianus, commonly known as the Gambel's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid environments. It has compound leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
