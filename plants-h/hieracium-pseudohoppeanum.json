It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges, and the flowers are yellow, often arranged in a dense cluster at the top of the plant. Hieracium pseudohoppeanum is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain habitats."
