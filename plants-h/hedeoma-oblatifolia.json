    "intro": "Hedeoma oblatifolia, commonly known as the flatleaf hedeoma, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers and broad, flat leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects. Hedeoma oblatifolia is generally drought-tolerant and has a low growth habit, making it a hardy plant in xeriscaping applications."
