It is characterized by its woody stems and large, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and have a rough, sometimes hairy texture. Hippomane horrida is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils."
