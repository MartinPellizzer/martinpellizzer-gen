It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically pale green with white or gray markings. The leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, giving them a distinctive, almost frosted appearance. It produces small, white flowers on slender stems during the cooler months. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or as a potted specimen due to its low maintenance requirements."
