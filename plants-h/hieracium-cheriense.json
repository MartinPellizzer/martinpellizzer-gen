    "intro": "Hieracium cheriense, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and often branched. Hieracium cheriense is known for its ability to spread rapidly through both seeds and rhizomes, making it an aggressive weed in some regions."
