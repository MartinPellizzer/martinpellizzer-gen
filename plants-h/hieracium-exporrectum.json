    "intro": "Hieracium exporrectum, commonly known as the rough hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, with hairy stems and leaves that are often glandular and rough to the touch. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinctive serrated edge, while the flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets. Hieracium exporrectum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
