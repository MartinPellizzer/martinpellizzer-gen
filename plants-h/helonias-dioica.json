    "intro": "Helonias dioica, commonly known as the swamp pink, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and marshes in the southeastern United States. It produces striking pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet, with slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its flowers are clustered in dense spikes and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. Helonias dioica is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
