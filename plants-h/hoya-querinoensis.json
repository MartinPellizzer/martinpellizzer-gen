    "intro": "Hoya querinoensis, commonly known as the Querino's waxplant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asclepiadaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia, and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in response to light exposure. Hoya querinoensis is a trailing plant that thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements contribute to its appeal among plant enthusiasts."
