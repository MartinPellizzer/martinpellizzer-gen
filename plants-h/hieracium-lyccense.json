    "intro": "Hieracium lyccense, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun. Its yellow flowers are surrounded by bracts that resemble leaves, and it produces small, elongated achenes as fruits. Hieracium lyccense is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to colonize new areas."
