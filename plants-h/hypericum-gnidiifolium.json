    "intro": "Hypericum gnidiifolium, commonly known as the gnidiifolium St. John's wort, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with woody stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, and the plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils. Hypericum gnidiifolium is also known for its medicinal properties, though it is less commonly used than other species in the genus."
