It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, and the flowers are surrounded by a series of bracts. Hieracium biebersteinii is often found in high-altitude environments where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
