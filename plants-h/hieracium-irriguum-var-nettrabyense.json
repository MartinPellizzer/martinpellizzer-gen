    "intro": "Hieracium irriguum var. nettrabyense, commonly known as the Nettraby Hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. It has a rosette of basal leaves that are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, with yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
