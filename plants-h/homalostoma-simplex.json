    "intro": "Homalostoma simplex, commonly known as the common flatworm, is a species of planarian belonging to the family Planariidae. It is a free-living, freshwater flatworm that lacks a complex circulatory system and instead relies on diffusion for gas exchange. The organism has a dorsoventrally flattened body and possesses a simple digestive system with a mouth and a pharynx. It is typically found in moist environments such as ponds and damp soil. Homalostoma simplex is notable for its regenerative abilities, capable of regenerating entire body parts from small fragments."
