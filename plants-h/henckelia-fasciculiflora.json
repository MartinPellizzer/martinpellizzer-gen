    "intro": "Henckelia fasciculiflora, commonly known as the clustered-flowered heath, is a member of the Ericaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests. The plant features small, leathery leaves and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the wet season. Its root system is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, a common trait among members of its family. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
