    "intro": "Hydrangea mollissima, commonly known as the smooth hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that can range in color from white to pink or blue, depending on soil pH. The plant produces opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky pubescence. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Hydrangea mollissima is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide seasonal interest throughout the growing season."
