    "intro": "Heliotropium glanduliferum, commonly known as the sticky heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which often have glandular structures that produce a sticky substance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically purple or pink in color. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive in non-native areas."
