    "intro": "Hemicarpha micrantha var. drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Drummond's needlegrass is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
