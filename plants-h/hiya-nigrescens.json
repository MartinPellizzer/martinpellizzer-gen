    "intro": "Hiya nigrescens, commonly known as the black-hued fern, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that often appear almost black in shade. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly across forest floors. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of its fronds. Hiya nigrescens thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense undergrowth where it competes for limited light."
