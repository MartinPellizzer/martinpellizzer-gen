    "intro": "Heliotropium parvifolium, commonly known as small-leaved heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, often with a strong, sweet scent. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it both a desirable and sometimes invasive species in certain environments."
