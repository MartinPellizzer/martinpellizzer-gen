    "intro": "Hieracium lactucifolium, commonly known as the lettuce-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow disc flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and hairy. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to form dense mats."
