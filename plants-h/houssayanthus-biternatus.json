It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves with three deeply lobed divisions and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is adapted to cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
