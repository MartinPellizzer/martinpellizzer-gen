    "intro": "Halanthium rarifolium var. aucherianum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water clover, is a rare aquatic plant native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, ribbon-like leaves that are arranged in a floating rosette, typically with a few small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while the flowers emerge just above the water surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
