    "intro": "Holosteum umbellatum var. glutinosum, commonly known as sticky false flax, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its unique sticky secretions on the leaves and stems serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. This species is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
