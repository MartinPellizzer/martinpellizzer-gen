It features slender, branching stems that produce clusters of bright yellow pea-like flowers during the spring and summer months. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant floral display and ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
