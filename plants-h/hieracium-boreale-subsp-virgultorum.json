    "intro": "Hieracium boreale subsp. virgultorum, commonly known as the northern hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces seeds in a distinctive disk-like structure. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
