    "intro": "Heliotropium nanum, commonly known as dwarf heliotrope, is a small, flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with delicate, hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces tiny, violet-colored flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling those of the common heliotrope. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed habitats. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal."
