    "intro": "Huperzia rostrifolia, commonly known as the rostrifoliate huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila, a structure typical of many ferns. Huperzia rostrifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
