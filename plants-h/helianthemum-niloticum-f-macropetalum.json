    "intro": "Helianthemum niloticum f. macropetalum, commonly known as the large-petaled sandverbena, is a compact, mat-forming shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, upright stems covered in dense, grayish-blue foliage. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with large, rounded petals that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant blooms and drought tolerance."
