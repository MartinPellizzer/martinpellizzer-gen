    "intro": "Hieracium froelichianum subsp. cavicola, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to orange flowers arranged in a single head, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the broader H. froelichianum species."
