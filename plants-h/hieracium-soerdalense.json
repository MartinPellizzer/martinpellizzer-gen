    "intro": "Hieracium soerdalense, commonly known as the Soerdalen hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe, this species is often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in drier environments. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in botanical studies due to its specific ecological preferences."
