    "intro": "Hieracium orsierae, commonly known as the Orsier's hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant is native to Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has a creeping growth habit with stolons that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
