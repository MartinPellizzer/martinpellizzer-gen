    "intro": "Herniaria fontanesii, commonly known as the rock crasswort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry, sunny habitats. The plant has small, fleshy, green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers in the summer. Its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate harsh conditions make it well adapted to its environment. The species is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, which can enhance soil fertility in its native habitat."
