    "intro": "Hieracium glaucum subsp. turbinatiforme, commonly known as the Turbinated Hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and rocky slopes. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, blue-green leaves and produces daisy-like yellow flowers with ray florets. Its stems are usually upright and hairy, supporting the inflorescence. It is characterized by its distinctive, turbinated (turbinate) flower heads, which give it its subspecific name."
