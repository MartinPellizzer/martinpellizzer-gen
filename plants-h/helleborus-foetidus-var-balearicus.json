    "intro": "Helleborus foetidus var. balearicus, commonly known as the Balearic hellebore, is a rare and ancient plant native to the Balearic Islands. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves and striking, pale green to white flowers. The plant is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in limestone soils. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
