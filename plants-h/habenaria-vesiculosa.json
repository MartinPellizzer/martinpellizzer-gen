    "intro": "Habenaria vesiculosa, commonly known as the bladder orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Australia. It is characterized by its unique, inflated flower pouch that resembles a bladder, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and heathlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in late winter to early spring. The species is part of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its delicate and ephemeral blooming period."
