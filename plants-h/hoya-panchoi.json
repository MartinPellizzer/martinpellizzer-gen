    "intro": "Hoya panchoi, commonly known as the Panchoi Wax Plant, is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often variegated with shades of white, green, and pink. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Hoya panchoi is a trailing plant that can be grown as a houseplant or in hanging baskets, preferring bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. Its slow growth and ability to thrive in low-light conditions make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
