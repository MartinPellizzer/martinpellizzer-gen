    "intro": "Hieracium magnauricula, commonly known as the large-leaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the daisy family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands. It has a creeping growth habit with stolons that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
