    "intro": "Haemaria dawsoniana, commonly known as the Dawson's ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in the understory of hardwood forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
