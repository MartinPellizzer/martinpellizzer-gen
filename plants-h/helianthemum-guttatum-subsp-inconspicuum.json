    "intro": "Helianthemum guttatum subsp. inconspicuum, commonly known as the inconspicuous sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It typically features dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for xerophytic conditions and it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
