    "intro": "Haynaldia villosa f. colorata, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats. Its floral structure includes five petals arranged in a symmetrical pattern, typical of the Verbenaceae family. It is a perennial herb that is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
