    "intro": "Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare, commonly known as barley, is a annual grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikelets and awned lemmas, which are typical features of the Poaceae family. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with hollow, node-bearing stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a terminal spike and lateral racemes, which contain the flowering structures. Barley is known for its hardiness and adaptability to a variety of soil types, making it a widely cultivated crop."
