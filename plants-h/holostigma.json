    "intro": "Holostigma, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a genus of aquatic plants native to Asia. It features showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface, with leaves that are often floating or submerged. The plant has a robust root system that anchors it in muddy substrates, while its stems can be either submerged or emergent. Holostigma species are known for their ability to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant's botanical structure includes a thick, waxy cuticle on its leaves, which helps reduce water loss and supports its aquatic lifestyle."
