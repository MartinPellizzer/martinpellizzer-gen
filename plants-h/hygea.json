    "intro": "Hygea, commonly known as the goddess of health in Greek mythology, is not a botanical term but often associated with plants symbolizing purity and healing. While not a real plant species, the name may be used metaphorically to describe plants with medicinal properties. Some plants, like the hyacinth or the hyssop, share similar names and are valued for their therapeutic uses. These plants often have vibrant colors and aromatic properties that contribute to their symbolic and practical significance. In horticulture, they are cultivated for both their beauty and their potential health benefits."
