It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. Its flowers are surrounded by leaf-like bracts, and it has a taproot system that helps it survive in various soil conditions. It is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
