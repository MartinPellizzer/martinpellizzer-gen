    "intro": "Hieracium subnigriceps, commonly known as the black-headed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright stems and basal rosette of leaves, which are typically hairy and lance-shaped. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which is surrounded by a dense layer of bracts that give it its distinctive appearance. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows and grasslands. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native flora."
