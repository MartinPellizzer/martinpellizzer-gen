    "intro": "Hubera amoena, commonly known as the pink bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep rose. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white\u7ed2\u6bdb, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
