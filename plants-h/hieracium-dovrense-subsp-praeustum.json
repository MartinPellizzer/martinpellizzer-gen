    "intro": "Hieracium dovrense subsp. praeustum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering heads that produce yellowish to reddish disc flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and open slopes at higher elevations. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
