    "intro": "Heliconia irrasa var. albicosta, commonly known as the white-streaked heliconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Heliconiaceae family and is characterized by its large, colorful bracts that enclose the inflorescence. The leaves are typically broad and pointed, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. The plant produces fragrant, orange-red flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bats. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
