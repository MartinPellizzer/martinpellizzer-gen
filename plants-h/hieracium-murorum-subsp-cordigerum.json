    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. cordigerum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as roadsides and meadows. It has a fibrous root system and produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
