    "intro": "Hoya lamingtoniae, commonly known as the Lamington Waxplant, is a species of flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light. Hoya lamingtoniae is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and ornamental appeal."
