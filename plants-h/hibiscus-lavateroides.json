    "intro": "Hibiscus lavateroides, commonly known as the Mexican hibiscus or the blue hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers, which are typically 5 to 7 inches in diameter and have five petals. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch and are arranged alternately along the stem. Hibiscus lavateroides thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which can last from summer through fall."
