    "intro": "Hieracium magyaricum subsp. marginale, commonly known as the Hungarian hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Central Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow daisy-like flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The subspecies marginale is distinguished by its narrow, marginally toothed leaves and a more compact growth habit compared to other hawkweed species. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
