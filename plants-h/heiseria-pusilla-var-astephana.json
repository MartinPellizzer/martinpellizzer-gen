    "intro": "Heiseria pusilla var. astephana, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are highly attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in suitable climates."
