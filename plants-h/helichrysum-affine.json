    "intro": "Helichrysum affine, commonly known as the everlasting or golden marguerite, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, fluffy yellow or golden flower heads that resemble dandelion blooms. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically clustered in compact, spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are usually linear and gray-green, covered in fine hairs that give them a fuzzy appearance. Helichrysum affine is often used in dried flower arrangements due to its long-lasting, vibrant appearance when dried."
