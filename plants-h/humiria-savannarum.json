    "intro": "Humiria savannarum, commonly known as the savanna daisy, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as savannas and grasslands. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with a distinctive central disc, which attract various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to reduce water loss in its often dry environment. Humiria savannarum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in warm climates."
