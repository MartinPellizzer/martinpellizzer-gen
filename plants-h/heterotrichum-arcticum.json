    "intro": "Heterotrichum arcticum, commonly known as the arctic haircap moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, acidic environments, such as tundra and boreal regions. The plant has elongated, pointed leaves that are usually reddish-brown when dry and bright green when wet. It produces spore capsules that are borne on short, erect stems called setae. Heterotrichum arcticum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its cold, northern habitats."
