    "intro": "Huperzia galapagensis, commonly known as the Gal\u00e1pagos huperzia, is a species of fern that is native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its simple, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a unique component of the Gal\u00e1pagos flora."
