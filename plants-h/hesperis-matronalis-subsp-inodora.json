    "intro": "Hesperis matronalis subsp. inodora, commonly known as the sweet rocket or evening snowflake, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its fragrant, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The subspecies inodora is distinguished by its lack of a strong scent, unlike the typical Hesperis matronalis. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders. This plant is also noted for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
