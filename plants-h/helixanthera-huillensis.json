It belongs to the Campanulaceae family, characterized by its bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid climates. Its flowers are usually blue or violet, with five petals arranged symmetrically. Due to its limited geographic range and habitat specificity, Helixanthera huillensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
