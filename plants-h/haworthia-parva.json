    "intro": "Haworthia parva, commonly known as the baby haworthia, is a small, compact succulent native to South Africa. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or indoor cultivation. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
