    "intro": "Harrimanella hypnoides, commonly known as the ghost moss, is a rare and delicate liverwort species native to the moist, shaded environments of the Pacific Northwest. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its intricate, moss-like appearance with a dense, velvety texture. The plant forms compact cushions or mats, often growing on rocks or decaying wood in cool, humid conditions. Its small, scale-like leaves are arranged in a tight spiral, and it produces tiny, spore-bearing capsules that are often hidden among the foliage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed, high-elevation ecosystems."
