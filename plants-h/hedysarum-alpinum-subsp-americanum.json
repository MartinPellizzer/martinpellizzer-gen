It is a herbaceous perennial that produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant has trifoliate leaves and is characterized by its climbing habit, often using tendrils to support itself on rocky substrates. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Hedysarum alpinum subsp. americanum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
