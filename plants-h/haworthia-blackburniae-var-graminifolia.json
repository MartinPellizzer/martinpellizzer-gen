It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are narrow and grass-like, giving it a unique appearance. The leaves are typically a bluish-green color with white or pale markings, and they are covered in a fine layer of wax. This variety is known for its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in well-draining soil with minimal water. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
