    "intro": "Hydrocotyle sagasteguii, commonly known as the Sagastegui's pennywort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Araceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are clustered in spadices, a common feature among members of its family. Hydrocotyle sagasteguii is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in slow-moving freshwater habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
