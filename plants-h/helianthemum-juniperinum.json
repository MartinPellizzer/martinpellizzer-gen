It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has evergreen foliage with leathery, dark green leaves that are aromatic when crushed. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
