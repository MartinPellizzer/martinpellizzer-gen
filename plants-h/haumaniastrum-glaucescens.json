    "intro": "Haumaniastrum glaucescens, commonly known as the blue-green morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in the morning and close in the afternoon. The plant has slender, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it both beautiful and somewhat invasive in certain regions."
