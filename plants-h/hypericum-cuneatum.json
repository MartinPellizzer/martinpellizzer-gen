    "intro": "Hypericum cuneatum, commonly known as narrowleaf St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green on top and grayish-white underneath. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and rocky soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Hypericum cuneatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in herbal medicine."
