    "intro": "Hieracium levicaule subsp. pseudosenile, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features basal and cauline leaves that are lanceolate to ovate, with a rough texture and prominent veins. Its flowering stems bear yellow composite flowers, composed of numerous small florets arranged in a disk-like structure. The subspecies is distinguished by its slender growth habit and reduced leaf size compared to other members of the Hieracium genus."
