It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, resinous sap that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub in humid, shaded environments, often found in the rainforests of Guyana and adjacent regions. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The flowers are small and clustered, often producing a fragrant, balsamic scent that attracts pollinators."
