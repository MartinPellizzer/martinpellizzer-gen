    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. brachymelanops, commonly known as the short-hairless hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are hairy and have a rough texture, with shorter, more upright leaves along the stem. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its reduced leaf hairs and compact growth form, distinguishing it from other hawkweed species."
