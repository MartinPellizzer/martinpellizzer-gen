    "intro": "Hieracium planifolium, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium planifolium is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize various habitats."
