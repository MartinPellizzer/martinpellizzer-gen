    "intro": "Heliotropium odorum, commonly known as the sweet willie or stinking willie, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of about 30 cm, featuring slender stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to purple, blooming throughout the warmer months. Its flowers emit a sweet, honey-like scent, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Heliotropium odorum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
