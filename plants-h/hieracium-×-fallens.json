    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 fallens, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that typically appear in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to Europe but has been introduced to various parts of the world, including North America. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. Hieracium \u00d7 fallens is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes."
