    "intro": "Helianthus integrifolius, commonly known as the smooth sunflower, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to the central and eastern United States, where it thrives in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and roadsides. The plant features large, showy yellow composite flowers with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, and its leaves are typically smooth and entire. It produces seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Helianthus integrifolius is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in gardens."
