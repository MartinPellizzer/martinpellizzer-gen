    "intro": "Heracleum moellendorffii var. paucivittatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cow parsnip, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically narrow and have a distinct, almost stripe-like appearance. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in flat-topped clusters, and it produces small, dark brown fruits known as schizocarps. This variant is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks, where it thrives in temperate climates."
