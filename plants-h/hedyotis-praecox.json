It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Hedyotis praecox is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and early blooming habit."
