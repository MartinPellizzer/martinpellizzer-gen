It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, often resembling those of true hyacinths. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
