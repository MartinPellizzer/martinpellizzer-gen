It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring moist and well-drained conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often have a serrated edge, while the flowers are yellow with a central disc. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
