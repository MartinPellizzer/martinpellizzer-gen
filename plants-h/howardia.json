    "intro": "Howardia, commonly known as the \"Succulent Star,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. These plants are characterized by their thick, fleshy leaves and showy, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. Howardia species are typically succulents, adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements. They thrive in well-draining soil and full sun, making them popular choices for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The genus includes several species, such as Howardia bullata and Howardia herbacea, which are prized for their ornamental value and resilience."
