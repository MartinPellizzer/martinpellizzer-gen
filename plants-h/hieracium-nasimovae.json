    "intro": "Hieracium nasimovae, commonly known as the Nasimov's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
