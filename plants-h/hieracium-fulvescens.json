    "intro": "Hieracium fulvescens, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, and its leaves are usually hairy and lance-shaped. Hieracium fulvescens is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
