It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. Its leaves are broadly lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with ray florets. Hieracium teliforme is known for its aggressive growth habit and can become invasive in certain regions."
