    "intro": "Henriettea lundellii, commonly known as the Lundell's henriettea, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Henriettea lundellii thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
