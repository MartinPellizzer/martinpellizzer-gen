    "intro": "Hypserpa monilifera, commonly known as the coral tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, branched growth habit and clusters of small, coral-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round, fleshy fruits that are often consumed by birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Hypserpa monilifera is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal and disturbed soils."
