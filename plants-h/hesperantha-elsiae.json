It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in areas with moderate to high rainfall. Hesperantha elsiae has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients. It is often found in mountainous regions and is prized for its ornamental value in horticulture."
