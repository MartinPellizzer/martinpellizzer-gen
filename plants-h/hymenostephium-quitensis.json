    "intro": "Hymenostephium quitensis, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Hymenostephium quitensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and potential ecological significance in alpine ecosystems."
