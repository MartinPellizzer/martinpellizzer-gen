    "intro": "Hyoseris major, commonly known as the great yellow dandelion, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed soils. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The seeds are dispersed by wind, encased in a pappus that aids in their spread."
