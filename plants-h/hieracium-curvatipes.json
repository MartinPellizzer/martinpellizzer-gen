    "intro": "Hieracium curvatipes, commonly known as the bent-stem hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its erect, often branched stem and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are usually alternate, with a rough texture and a slightly hairy surface. Hieracium curvatipes is native to Europe and has been introduced to other parts of the world, where it can sometimes become invasive."
