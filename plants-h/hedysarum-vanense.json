    "intro": "Hedysarum vanense, commonly known as the Vanese sweetclover, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. Hedysarum vanense plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
