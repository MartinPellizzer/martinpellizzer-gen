    "intro": "Helianthus polyphyllus, commonly known as the stiffleaf sunflower, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and large, showy yellow ray flowers surrounding a central disk of smaller florets. The plant produces numerous leaves that are stiff and often covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a suitable candidate for xeriscaping. Helianthus polyphyllus is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
