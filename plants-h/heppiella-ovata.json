    "intro": "Heppiella ovata, commonly known as the ovate heppiella, is a small, perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Heppiella ovata is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. It is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences."
