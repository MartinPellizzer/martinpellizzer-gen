    "intro": "Heracleum apiifolium, commonly known as the clustered cowparsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist meadows and woodland edges. The plant features a tall, slender stem with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. Its flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer, are small and white, arranged in compound umbels. The plant is known for its strong, often unpleasant odor, which can be released when the leaves are crushed."
