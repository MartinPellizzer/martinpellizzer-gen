    "intro": "Hermannia cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf hermannia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its compact growth habit. The plant features opposite, ovate to heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Hermannia cordata is well-suited for rock gardens or containers due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
