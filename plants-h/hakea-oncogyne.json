    "intro": "Hakea oncogyne, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its stiff, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces distinctive red or orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and salt-tolerant nature make it well adapted to coastal environments. Hakea oncogyne is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and resilience to harsh conditions."
