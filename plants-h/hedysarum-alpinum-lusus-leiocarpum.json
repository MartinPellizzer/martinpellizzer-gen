    "intro": "Hedysarum alpinum lusus leiocarpum, commonly known as the alpine vetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, characterized by its low stature and dense foliage. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its compound leaves are pinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil in rocky habitats. Hedysarum alpinum lusus leiocarpum is valued for its ecological role in preventing soil erosion and providing nectar for pollinators."
