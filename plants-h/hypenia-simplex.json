It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, compound leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in umbellate inflorescences, a common trait among members of its family. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Hypenia simplex is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and flowering habit."
