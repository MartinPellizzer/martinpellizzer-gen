    "intro": "Haloragis heterophylla var. glaucifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf willowherb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, powdery hairs. The plant typically grows in wetland or riparian habitats, thriving in moist soils along watercourses. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often vary in shape depending on light exposure. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are pollinated by insects and contribute to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
