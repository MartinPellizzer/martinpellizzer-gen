    "intro": "Hieracium glomeratum subsp. ambiguum, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites, preferring well-drained soils. It has basal rosettes of lanceolate leaves and produces dense clusters of yellow flowers in the summer. Its subspecific name, *ambiguum*, reflects the variability in its morphological features compared to other members of the species."
