    "intro": "Hieracium pinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and deeply lobed, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. Hieracium pinnatifidum produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
