    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium var. macrocarpum, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, umbrella-like compound leaves that can reach up to 1.5 meters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in spherical umbels, which are typically visible in late summer. Its stems are thick, hollow, and covered with white, hair-like spots, and they exude a milky sap when broken. Due to its toxic sap and potential to cause severe skin irritation, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
