    "intro": "Hepatica falconeri, commonly known as the Falkland Island hepatica, is a perennial herb native to the Falkland Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, appearing in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal grasslands and rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
