    "intro": "Haworthia retusa var. densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, bluish-green leaves with prominent white tubercles and spines. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
