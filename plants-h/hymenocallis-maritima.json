    "intro": "Hymenocallis maritima, commonly known as the sea onion, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its strap-shaped, grass-like leaves and produces striking white or pale yellow flowers with a strong, sweet fragrance. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in maritime environments. It is a perennial herb that is drought-tolerant and can withstand salt spray, making it well-suited to coastal habitats. The bulbs of Hymenocallis maritima are edible when young and have been used by indigenous peoples for food and medicinal purposes."
