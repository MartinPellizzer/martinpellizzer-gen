    "intro": "Himantoglossum hircinum f. longelaciniatum, commonly known as the long-leaved hare's-foot clover, is a rare and distinctive plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that are often more than twice the length of the standard leaves, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
