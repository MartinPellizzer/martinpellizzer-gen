It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering head composed of yellow ray florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows. It has a deep taproot system that allows it to thrive in well-drained soils. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in certain regions."
