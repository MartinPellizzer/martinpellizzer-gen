    "intro": "Hibiscus helvolus, commonly known as the giant marsh hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter, typically in shades of pink, red, or white. The plant thrives in moist, swampy environments and has heart-shaped, broad leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil in wetland areas, making it an important species for ecological restoration. Hibiscus helvolus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with adequate water supply."
