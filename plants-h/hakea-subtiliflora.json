    "intro": "Hakea subtiliflora, commonly known as the slender hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers in late summer to early autumn, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Hakea subtiliflora is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and fire resilience. It plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and nectar for native wildlife."
