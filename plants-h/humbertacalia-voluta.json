    "intro": "Humbertacalia voluta, commonly known as the spiral bellflower, is a striking member of the Campanulaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its spiral arrangement of leaves and its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Humbertacalia voluta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
