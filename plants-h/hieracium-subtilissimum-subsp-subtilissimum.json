It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its slender stems and small, yellowish to reddish composite flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It has finely divided, grass-like leaves and produces numerous small achenes as its seeds. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a rare and endangered species in parts of its range."
