It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Hieracium stymnophytum is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a persistent weed and a valuable component of certain ecosystems."
