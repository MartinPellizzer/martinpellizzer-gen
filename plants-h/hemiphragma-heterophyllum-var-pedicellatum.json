    "intro": "Hemiphragma heterophyllum var. pedicellatum, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of pale pink to white, pendulous flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are pollinated by specific species of moths, which are attracted to its unique scent. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
