    "intro": "Hiraea bahiensis var. typica, commonly known as the Brazilian hiraea, is a flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its unique floral structure and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and biodiversity in tropical ecosystems."
