    "intro": "Hieracium coniflorum, commonly known as the coniferous hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in a single, terminal head. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Hieracium coniflorum is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through its rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
