    "intro": "Helicia caulifloroides, commonly known as the mountain helicia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically arranged in clusters. The plant exhibits cauliflorous growth, meaning its flowers and fruits develop directly on the trunk and branches rather than at the ends of stems. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and montane rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
