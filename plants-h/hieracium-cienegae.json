    "intro": "Hieracium cienegae, commonly known as the Everglades hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of southern Florida. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers with five petals. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in marshy areas and along the edges of water bodies. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes. Due to its habitat preferences, it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
