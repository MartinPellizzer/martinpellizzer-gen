It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are bright yellow with a central disk. Hieracium phalarograptoides is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes and is sometimes considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit."
