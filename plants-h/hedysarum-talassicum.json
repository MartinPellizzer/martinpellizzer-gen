    "intro": "Hedysarum talassicum, commonly known as sea hedysarum, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shorelines. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps stabilize coastal dunes. Hedysarum talassicum is adapted to salt spray and is often used in coastal landscaping for erosion control."
