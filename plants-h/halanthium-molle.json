    "intro": "Halanthium molle, commonly known as the soft bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in freshwater habitats. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are often covered in tiny, bladder-like structures called vesicles. These vesicles help the plant float and are used to trap small organisms, which the plant then digests. The plant is part of the Lentibulariaceae family, known for its carnivorous tendencies. Halanthium molle plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
