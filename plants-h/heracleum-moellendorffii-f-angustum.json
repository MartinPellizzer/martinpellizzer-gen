    "intro": "Heracleum moellendorffii f. angustum, commonly known as narrowleaf cow parsnip, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically less than 1 meter in height. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as stream banks and meadows. Due to its resemblance to poison hemlock, it requires careful identification to avoid confusion with toxic species."
