    "intro": "Herpestis, commonly known as the marsh woundwort, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Scrophulariaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are found in moist or wetland habitats across Europe, Asia, and North America. The plants typically have square stems, opposite leaves, and showy, often violet or purple flowers. Herpestis species are characterized by their ability to thrive in damp environments, making them common in marshes and along stream banks. They are often used in traditional medicine and are sometimes considered invasive in certain regions."
