    "intro": "Helianthemum oelandicum subsp. allionii, commonly known as the Allion's rock rose, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun exposure. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, where it contributes to the biodiversity of rocky habitats."
