It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges. Heisteria celastrinea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
