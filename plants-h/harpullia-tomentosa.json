    "intro": "Harpullia tomentosa, commonly known as the silky tamarind, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and dense, rounded canopy. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, pod-like fruits. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ornamental and ecological purposes in tropical landscapes."
