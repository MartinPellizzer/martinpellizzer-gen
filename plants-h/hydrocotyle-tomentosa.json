    "intro": "Hydrocotyle tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly water pennywort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow water, wetlands, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has rounded, waxy leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its small, white flowers bloom in clusters and are often submerged or floating. Hydrocotyle tomentosa plays a role in stabilizing aquatic habitats and providing shelter for small aquatic organisms."
