    "intro": "Hydrangea macrophylla var. alboglobosa, commonly known as the \"Snowball hydrangea,\" is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its large, round flower clusters that are typically white, though they can change color based on soil pH. The plant produces showy inflorescences composed of sterile flowers, which give it a fluffy, globular appearance. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the white blooms. This variety thrives in partial shade and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth and color development."
