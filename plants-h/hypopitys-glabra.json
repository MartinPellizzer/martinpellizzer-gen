    "intro": "Hypopitys glabra, commonly known as the smooth hypopitys, is a rare and specialized plant belonging to the conifer family. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring scale-like leaves and a short, unbranched stem. This plant is typically found in specific, often remote habitats, such as rocky outcrops or acidic soils. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, reflecting its ecological niche. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
