    "intro": "Helianthemum marifolium var. niveum, commonly known as the snow-hedgenut, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has silvery-white, woolly foliage that provides a striking contrast to its floral display. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cool, sunny environments."
