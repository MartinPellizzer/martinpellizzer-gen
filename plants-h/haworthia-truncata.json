    "intro": "Haworthia truncata, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features a compact rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves that are marked with distinct white or pale green stripes. The leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to store water in its native arid environment. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. This plant is well-suited for indoor growing and requires minimal water and bright, indirect sunlight."
