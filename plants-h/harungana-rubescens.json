    "intro": "Harungana rubescens, commonly known as the red flame tree, is a fast-growing deciduous tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking red flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The tree has a broad, umbrella-like canopy with pinnately compound leaves that turn yellow before falling in autumn. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, and it produces woody pods containing flat, brown seeds. Harungana rubescens is often used in agroforestry and for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
