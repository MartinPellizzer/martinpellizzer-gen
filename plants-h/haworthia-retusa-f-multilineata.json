    "intro": "Haworthia retusa f. multilineata, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves with distinctive white to light green markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The leaves are typically gray-green in color and have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers on tall, slender stems during the warmer months. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and ornamental appearance."
