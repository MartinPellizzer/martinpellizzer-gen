    "intro": "Helietta parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved helietta, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale green, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage remains evergreen throughout the year, providing ornamental value in both landscape and garden settings. Helietta parvifolia is well adapted to moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetland or swampy environments."
