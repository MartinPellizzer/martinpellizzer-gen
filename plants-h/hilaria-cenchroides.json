    "intro": "Hilaria cenchroides, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often rolled at the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale blue flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. Hilaria cenchroides is drought-tolerant and is used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
