    "intro": "Haloragis acutangula f. semiangulata, commonly known as the narrow-angled willowherb, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Haloragaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and stream banks, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a distinctively sharp angle at the base, giving it its specific epithet. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to tolerate saline conditions."
