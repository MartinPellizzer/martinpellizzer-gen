    "intro": "Halodule australis, commonly known as the Australian shoal grass, is a species of seagrass found primarily in shallow coastal waters of the Indo-Pacific region. It thrives in sandy or muddy substrates and is often found in association with other seagrass species. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by water. Halodule australis plays an important role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various marine organisms. Its presence is an indicator of healthy coastal ecosystems."
