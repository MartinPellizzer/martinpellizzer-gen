    "intro": "Hymenophyllum lineare var. dussii, commonly known as the Dussi's filmy fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the Hymenophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The fronds are linear and often recurved, with a finely toothed margin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. The spore-bearing structures, or sporangia, are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns."
