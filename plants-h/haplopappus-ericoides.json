    "intro": "Haplopappus ericoides, commonly known as the prickly goldenweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, shrub-like appearance with small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by small, bract-like structures that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats. Haplopappus ericoides is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh, drought-prone conditions."
