    "intro": "Hieracium auriculoides subsp. semiauriculoides, commonly known as the semi-auriculate hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The leaves are typically lanceolate and have a distinctive auriculate (ear-like) base, which gives the species its common name. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. The plant is known for its ability to spread through both vegetative growth and seeds, making it a common but sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
