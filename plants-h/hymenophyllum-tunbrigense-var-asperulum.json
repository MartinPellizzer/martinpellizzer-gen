It is characterized by its small, leathery, and densely packed fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its intricate leaf structure and unique growth habits make it a distinctive and interesting subject for botanical study."
