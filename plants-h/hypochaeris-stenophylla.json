    "intro": "Hypochaeris stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom from spring to early summer. Hypochaeris stenophylla is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common weed in disturbed habitats."
