    "intro": "Hieracium amplexifolium, commonly known as the clinging hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that clasp the stem, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow daisy-like flowers with ray florets and a central disk of tubular flowers. It is typically found in moist, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and wetlands. Hieracium amplexifolium is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive."
