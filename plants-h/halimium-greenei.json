    "intro": "Halimium greenei, commonly known as the Greene's catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Halimium greenei is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in dry, open habitats."
