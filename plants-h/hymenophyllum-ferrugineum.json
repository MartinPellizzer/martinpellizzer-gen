    "intro": "Hymenophyllum ferrugineum, commonly known as the rusty fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to New Zealand. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its fronds are lance-shaped and covered with a dense layer of fine, hairy scales. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori. Hymenophyllum ferrugineum is notable for its ability to tolerate low light and high humidity, making it a popular choice for tropical gardens."
