It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and the plant is often found in mountain meadows and slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in several European countries."
