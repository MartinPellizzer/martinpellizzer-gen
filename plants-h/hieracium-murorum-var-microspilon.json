    "intro": "Hieracium murorum var. microspilon, commonly known as the small-spored meadow hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flower heads composed of numerous tiny florets. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and along streambanks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in parts of its native range."
