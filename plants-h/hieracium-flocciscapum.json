    "intro": "Hieracium flocciscapum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and its showy, yellow-orange composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its spread across various regions. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
