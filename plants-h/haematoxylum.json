    "intro": "Haematoxylum, commonly known as red sanders, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Asia, particularly India, and is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown heartwood. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is known for its aromatic properties. Haematoxylum species are valued for their timber, which is used in furniture and musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting, many species are now endangered and protected under international conservation agreements."
