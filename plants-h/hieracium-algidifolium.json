    "intro": "Hieracium algidifolium, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are typically lanceolate and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in a single, terminal head, which are surrounded by leaf-like bracts. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes at high altitudes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
