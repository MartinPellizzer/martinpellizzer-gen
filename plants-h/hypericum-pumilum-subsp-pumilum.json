    "intro": "Hypericum pumilum subsp. pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in midsummer, typically from June to August. The plant has slender, ascending stems with opposite, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its medicinal properties are similar to those of other Hypericum species, though it is less commonly used in traditional herbal medicine. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, cold environments."
