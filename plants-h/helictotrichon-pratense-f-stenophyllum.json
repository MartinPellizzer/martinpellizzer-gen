    "intro": "Helictotrichon pratense f. stenophyllum, commonly known as narrow-leaved bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
