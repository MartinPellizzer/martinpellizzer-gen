    "intro": "Habenaria racemosa, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, hair-like leaves and a long, slender inflorescence that bears numerous small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and swamps. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form colonies. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native environment."
