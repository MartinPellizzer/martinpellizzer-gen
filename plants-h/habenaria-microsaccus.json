It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that produce a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, often with a distinctive sac-like structure on the lip. This orchid is noted for its delicate appearance and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
