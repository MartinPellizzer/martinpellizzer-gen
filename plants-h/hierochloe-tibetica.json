    "intro": "Hierochloe tibetica, commonly known as Tibetan hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, hair-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense mats that help stabilize the soil. It is adapted to cold, arid conditions and can thrive in poor nutrient soils. Hierochloe tibetica plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and forage for grazing animals."
