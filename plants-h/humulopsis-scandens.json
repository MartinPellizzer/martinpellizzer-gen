    "intro": "Humulopsis scandens, commonly known as the climbing hop plant, is a vigorous vine native to the southeastern United States. It features compound leaves with three to five oval leaflets, often with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by cone-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
