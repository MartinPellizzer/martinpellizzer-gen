    "intro": "Habenaria amalfitana, commonly known as the Amalfi orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Italy. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, spurred flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing fragrant, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive lip. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and limestone cliffs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
