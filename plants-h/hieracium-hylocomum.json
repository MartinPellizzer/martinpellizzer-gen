    "intro": "Hieracium hylocomum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It has a fibrous root system and can spread through both seeds and rhizomes. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in some regions."
