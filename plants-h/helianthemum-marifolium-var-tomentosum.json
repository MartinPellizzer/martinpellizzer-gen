It features dense, grayish-white pubescence covering its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to Mediterranean climates. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
