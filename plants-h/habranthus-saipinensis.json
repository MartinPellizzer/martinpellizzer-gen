It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its star-shaped, showy blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and has adapted to the tropical climate with high humidity and salt spray. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
