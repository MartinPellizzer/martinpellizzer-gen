    "intro": "Heliophila xylopoda, commonly known as the water heliopsis, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that help it thrive in moist conditions. It is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Heliophila xylopoda plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
