    "intro": "Hieracium conflectens, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, preferring moist to moderately dry conditions. Its leaves are basal, rough, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium conflectens is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some habitats."
