    "intro": "Hansalia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and striking, showy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Hansalia thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches, relying on specific host trees for support. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Hansalia is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for its protection."
