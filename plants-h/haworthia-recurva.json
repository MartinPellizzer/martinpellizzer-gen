    "intro": "Haworthia recurva, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green with white or yellow markings resembling a zebra's stripes. The plant is compact, usually growing to a height of about 10\u201315 centimeters, and thrives in well-draining soil. It prefers bright, indirect light and minimal water, making it ideal for indoor cultivation. Haworthia recurva is also noted for its ability to store water in its fleshy leaves, allowing it to survive in arid conditions."
