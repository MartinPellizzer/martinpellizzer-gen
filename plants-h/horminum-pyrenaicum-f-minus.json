    "intro": "Horminum pyrenaicum f. minus, commonly known as the dwarf Pyrenean bellflower, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb native to the Pyrenees region. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense mat, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats. It is characterized by its reduced size compared to the typical form of Horminum pyrenaicum, making it a striking addition to rock gardens or alpine collections. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
