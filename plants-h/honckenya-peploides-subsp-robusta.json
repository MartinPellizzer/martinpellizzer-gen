    "intro": "Honckenya peploides subsp. robusta, commonly known as the robust sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered with dense, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments."
