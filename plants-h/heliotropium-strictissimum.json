    "intro": "Heliotropium strictissimum, commonly known as the narrowleaf heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or pink. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in disturbed habitats. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions, though it can also become invasive in certain environments."
