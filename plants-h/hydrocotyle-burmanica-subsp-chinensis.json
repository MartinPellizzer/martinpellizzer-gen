    "intro": "Hydrocotyle burmanica subsp. chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese spurge or water shield, is a herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in the summer months. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
