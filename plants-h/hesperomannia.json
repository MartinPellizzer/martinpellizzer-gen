    "intro": "Hesperomannia, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the Malvaceae family. It consists of a single species, Hesperomannia calycina, which is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its hairy, succulent stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Hesperomannia is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to desert conditions."
