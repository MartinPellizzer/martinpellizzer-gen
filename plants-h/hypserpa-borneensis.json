    "intro": "Hypserpa borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean star orchid, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in the canopy. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
