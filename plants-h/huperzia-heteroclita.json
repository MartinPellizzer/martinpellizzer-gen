    "intro": "Huperzia heteroclita, commonly known as the variable huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its erect, branching fronds that are typically covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries like China, India, and Japan. Huperzia heteroclita has a distinctive reproductive structure called a synangium, which is a cluster of sporangia that develops at the base of the fronds. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas."
