    "intro": "Hieracium caesium var. maculiferum, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically hairy and have a distinctive spotted or mottled appearance, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. This plant is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
