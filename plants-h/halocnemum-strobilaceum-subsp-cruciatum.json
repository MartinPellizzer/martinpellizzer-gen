    "intro": "Halocnemum strobilaceum subsp. cruciatum, commonly known as the saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline environments. It thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often found in coastal areas and salt flats. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss and are covered in a waxy layer. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow and arranged in dense clusters. This subspecies plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in harsh, saline habitats."
