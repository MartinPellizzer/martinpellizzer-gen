    "intro": "Hildaea, commonly known as the \"butterfly plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Hildaea species are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers that resemble butterflies, hence their common name. The leaves are typically narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. They are often grown as ornamental plants due to their striking appearance and drought tolerance."
