    "intro": "Hamamelis persica, commonly known as Persian witch hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late autumn, typically from October to November. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. Hamamelis persica is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its astringent properties."
