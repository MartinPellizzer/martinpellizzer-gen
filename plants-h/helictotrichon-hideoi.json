    "intro": "Helictotrichon hideoi, commonly known as the Japanese hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Japan. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Helictotrichon hideoi is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas."
