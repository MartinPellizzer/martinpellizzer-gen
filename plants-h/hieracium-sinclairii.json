    "intro": "Hieracium sinclairii, commonly known as Sinclair's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in coastal and alpine regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and its leaves are usually basal, with a rough, hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native habitat."
