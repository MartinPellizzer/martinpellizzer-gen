    "intro": "Hoya calycina subsp. calycina, commonly known as the Wandering Jew or prayer plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asclepiadaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, waxy flowers. The plant is known for its ability to climb using aerial roots, often found growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hoya calycina subsp. calycina is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
