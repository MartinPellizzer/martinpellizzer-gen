    "intro": "Holboellia latifolia var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed holboellia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lanceolate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded woodland environments. The leaves and stems are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties."
