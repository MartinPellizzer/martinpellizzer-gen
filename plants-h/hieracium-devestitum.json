It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It produces yellow flowers that are often surrounded by a ring of leaf-like bracts. Hieracium devestitum is known for its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry conditions."
