    "intro": "Hieracium apuanorum, commonly known as the Apuanum Hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Apuan Alps in Tuscany, Italy. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is adapted to the mountainous environment with its low-growing, mat-forming habit. It produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native region."
