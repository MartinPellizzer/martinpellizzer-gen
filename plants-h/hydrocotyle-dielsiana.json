    "intro": "Hydrocotyle dielsiana, commonly known as the \"Mexican water shield,\" is a perennial aquatic plant native to Central and South America. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has floating leaves that are usually divided into lobes, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Its small, yellow flowers appear in clusters and are pollinated by insects. Hydrocotyle dielsiana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and stabilizing water surfaces."
