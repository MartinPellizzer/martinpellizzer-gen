It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. This variant is distinguished from other hieracium species by its smaller, more delicate flowers and shorter stems."
