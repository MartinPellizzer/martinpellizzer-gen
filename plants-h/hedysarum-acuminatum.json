    "intro": "Hedysarum acuminatum, commonly known as the sharp-horned vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Hedysarum acuminatum is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to temperate climates. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
