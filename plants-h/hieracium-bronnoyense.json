    "intro": "Hieracium bronnoyense, commonly known as the Bronnoy Islands groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the remote Bronnoy Islands in the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats, thriving in the harsh Arctic climate with its short growing season. Hieracium bronnoyense is adapted to cold environments, exhibiting a low, compact growth form to minimize exposure to wind and frost. Its flowers bloom in late summer, adding a splash of yellow to the otherwise barren landscape of the islands."
