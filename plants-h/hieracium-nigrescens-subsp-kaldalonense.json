    "intro": "Hieracium nigrescens subsp. kaldalonense, commonly known as the Kaldalon alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of the European Alps. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky and gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in open, sunny habitats. Its subspecific classification reflects its distinct morphology and geographic distribution compared to other members of the Hieracium species. It is adapted to cold climates and has a short growing season, typical of alpine flora."
