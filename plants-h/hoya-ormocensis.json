    "intro": "Hoya ormocensis, commonly known as the Orchid Trumpet, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a subtle fragrance. Hoya ormocensis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and ease of care make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
