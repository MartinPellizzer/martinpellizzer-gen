    "intro": "Hedysarum molle, commonly known as sweet clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a strong root system that helps prevent soil erosion and fixes nitrogen, enriching the soil. It is often used in forage and as a cover crop due to its rapid growth and adaptability. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
