It typically grows in wetland and swampy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are arranged in spikelets. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates. Holoschoenus australis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience."
