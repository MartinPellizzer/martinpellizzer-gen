    "intro": "Hexanthus, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its striking, silver-gray foliage that reflects light and gives it a unique appearance. The leaves are typically alternate and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Hexanthus species are native to various regions in Africa and are often found in dry, rocky habitats. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds."
