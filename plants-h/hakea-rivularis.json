    "intro": "Hakea rivularis, commonly known as the river hakea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody, spherical seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and riverine habitats. Hakea rivularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
