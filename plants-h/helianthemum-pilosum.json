    "intro": "Helianthemum pilosum, commonly known as the woolly rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and North Africa. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its branches. The plant has silvery-gray foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Helianthemum pilosum is drought-tolerant and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens and xeriscaping."
