    "intro": "Hirtella pendula, commonly known as the hanging hirtella, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its pendulous, clustered inflorescences that produce small, white to pale pink flowers. The leaves are opposite, elliptical, and covered with fine, soft hairs, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or limestone soils. Hirtella pendula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
