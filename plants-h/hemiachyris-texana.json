    "intro": "Hemiachyris texana, commonly known as Texas silverleaf, is a perennial shrub native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by fluffy, white seed heads. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Hemiachyris texana is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
