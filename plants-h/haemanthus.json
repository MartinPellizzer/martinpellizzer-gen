It is native to southern Africa and features striking, umbel-like clusters of bright red or orange flowers. The plants typically have strap-shaped leaves and are often cultivated for their ornamental value. Many species are bulbous, with underground storage organs that allow them to survive dry periods. Haemanthus species are popular in gardens due to their vibrant blooms and relatively low maintenance requirements."
