    "intro": "Hieracium samadense, commonly known as Samad's hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are usually basal, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a dense inflorescence. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Hieracium samadense is considered a rare and endemic species."
