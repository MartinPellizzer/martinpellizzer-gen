    "intro": "Hieracium panduriforme, commonly known as the broadleaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and can reach heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Hieracium panduriforme is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
