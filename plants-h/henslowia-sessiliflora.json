It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered umbels of white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with finely divided segments that give it a delicate appearance. Henslowia sessiliflora is often found in wetland habitats and is considered a rare species in its native range."
