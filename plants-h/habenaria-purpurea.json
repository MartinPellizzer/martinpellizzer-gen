It is characterized by its dense, spiraled inflorescence of violet or purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces a single, long, flowering stem. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
