    "intro": "Hieracium patens, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in early summer, followed by the development of bristly, oval-shaped seeds. Hieracium patens is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
