It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are rigid and often covered in fine hairs, and its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Hieracium rigidatum is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed habitats and can sometimes become invasive in certain regions."
