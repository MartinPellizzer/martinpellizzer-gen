    "intro": "Hanguana major, commonly known as the giant hanguana, is a striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to two meters in length, often with a glossy green surface and prominent veins. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of yellow and orange, which attract a variety of pollinators. Its robust root system allows it to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils, making it a dominant species in its habitat. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and tropical landscapes."
