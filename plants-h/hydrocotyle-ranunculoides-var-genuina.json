    "intro": "Hydrocotyle ranunculoides var. genuina, commonly known as the smoothleaf water shield, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are divided into five to nine lobes, with a waxy surface that helps it remain buoyant. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its roots are often submerged, allowing it to thrive in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The leaves are typically smooth and rounded, contributing to its distinctive appearance in aquatic environments."
