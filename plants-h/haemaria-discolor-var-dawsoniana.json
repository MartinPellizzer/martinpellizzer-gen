    "intro": "Haemaria discolor var. dawsoniana, commonly known as Dawson's ghost flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its pale blue to violet flowers that appear in late summer, often in clusters at the ends of its slender stems. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving it a ghostly appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
