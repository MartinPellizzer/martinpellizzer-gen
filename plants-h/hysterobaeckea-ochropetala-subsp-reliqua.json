    "intro": "Hysterobaeckea ochropetala subsp. reliqua, commonly known as the slender ghostflower, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its small, pale yellow flowers and slender, often prostrate growth habit. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
