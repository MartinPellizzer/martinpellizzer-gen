    "intro": "Helictotrichon compactum, commonly known as the bluegrass or meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fine, bluish-green leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in meadows, prairies, and along roadsides. Helictotrichon compactum plays an important ecological role by providing forage for grazing animals and supporting pollinators."
