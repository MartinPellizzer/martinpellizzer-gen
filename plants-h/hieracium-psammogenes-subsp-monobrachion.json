    "intro": "Hieracium psammogenes subsp. monobrachion, commonly known as the sand everlasting or sand dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to sandy and coastal environments. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves and a single, erect flowering stem that bears a cluster of small, yellow flowers. The plant produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal, aiding in its propagation across open, disturbed habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes, coastal grasslands, and sandy fields. Due to its ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes, it is an important plant in coastal ecosystems."
