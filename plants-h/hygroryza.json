    "intro": "Hygroryza, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of aquatic ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, feathery fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. Hygroryza species are often found in slow-moving streams, ponds, and marshy areas, where they play a role in aquatic ecosystems. Their rhizomes help stabilize the substrate, and their fronds provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. The genus is notable for its ability to tolerate varying water conditions and its use in traditional medicine in some regions."
