It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often adorned with striking red veins. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
