    "intro": "Hypolepis crassa, commonly known as the broad-leaf huperzia, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It is characterized by its robust, evergreen fronds that are typically broad and leathery in texture. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Hypolepis crassa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
