    "intro": "Hedyotis serpens, commonly known as the snake's head or creeping blushing root, is a low-growing perennial herb native to various parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that are typically borne in clusters, adding a striking visual element to its foliage. Its leaves are usually opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Hedyotis serpens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks."
