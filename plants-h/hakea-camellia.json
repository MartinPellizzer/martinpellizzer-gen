    "intro": "Hakea camellia, commonly known as the Christmas bush, is a shrub native to Australia. It features woody stems and dense, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder. The plant produces striking, red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant once established. The flowers attract nectar-feeding birds and insects, making it an important plant in native ecosystems."
