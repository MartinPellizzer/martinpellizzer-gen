    "intro": "Hydrocotyle verticillata, commonly known as the marsh mallow or water shield, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist environments. It features a rosette of heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its root system helps stabilize soil and improve water quality in aquatic habitats. Hydrocotyle verticillata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
