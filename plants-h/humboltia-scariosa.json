    "intro": "Humboltia scariosa, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Humboltia scariosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
