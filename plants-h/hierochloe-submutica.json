    "intro": "Hierochloe submutica, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow, with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Hierochloe submutica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
