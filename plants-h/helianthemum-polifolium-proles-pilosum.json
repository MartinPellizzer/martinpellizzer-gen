    "intro": "Helianthemum polifolium proles pilosum, commonly known as the woolly rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub with small, fleshy leaves covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. Its hardy nature makes it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping in dry climates."
