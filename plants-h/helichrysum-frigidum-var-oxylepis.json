It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its dense clusters of yellow to golden-orange flowers. The plant produces small, bract-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its flowers are long-lasting and retain their color when dried, making it a popular choice for floral arrangements."
