It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves with a distinctive zebra-like pattern of white and green markings. The leaves are typically short and upright, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the growing season. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
