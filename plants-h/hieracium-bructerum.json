    "intro": "Hieracium bructerum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its yellow flowers are showy and bloom from late spring to early summer. Hieracium bructerum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
