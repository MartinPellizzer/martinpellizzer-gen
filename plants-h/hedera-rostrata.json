    "intro": "Hedera rostrata, commonly known as the rostrate ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to southern Europe. It features dark green, lobed leaves that are often adorned with a distinctive reddish or purple margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on walls or trees. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some regions."
