It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in forested or shrubland habitats. Hedysarum austrokurilense plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native ecosystems."
