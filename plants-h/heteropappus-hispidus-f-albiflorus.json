    "intro": "Heteropappus hispidus f. albiflorus, commonly known as the whiteflowered horseweed, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, and its flowers are typically white or pale yellow. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a pappus, which aids in its propagation. This variant is distinguished by its lighter floral coloration compared to the typical form of Heteropappus hispidus."
