    "intro": "Hylomecon vernalis, commonly known as spring hylomecon, is a rare and delicate herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often near streams or in areas with rich, well-drained soil. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring. Its flowering period is short-lived, making it a challenging plant to observe in the wild. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Hylomecon vernalis is considered endangered in many regions."
