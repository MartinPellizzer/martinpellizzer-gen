    "intro": "Halmyra stellaris, commonly known as the starlight lily, is a striking perennial plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a waxy texture and a silvery-blue hue on the underside. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from moist, well-drained soils. Halmyra stellaris is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance in garden settings."
