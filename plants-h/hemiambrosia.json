    "intro": "Hemiambrosia, commonly known as the \"half-nectar\" plant, is a rare and enigmatic species found in specific tropical regions. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which features a combination of nectar-producing and non-nectar-producing parts. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers emit a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators, such as certain species of moths. Due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements, hemiambrosia is considered a vulnerable species."
