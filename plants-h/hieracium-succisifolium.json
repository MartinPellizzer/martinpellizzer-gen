    "intro": "Hieracium succisifolium, commonly known as the succulent hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are adapted to store water, a characteristic typical of succulent plants. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid gardens."
