    "intro": "Helianthocereus huascha var. macranthus, commonly known as the showy night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny stems and large, white to pale yellow flowers that open at night. The flowers are highly fragrant and attract nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water. It produces small, edible fruits that are typically consumed by wildlife and occasionally by humans."
