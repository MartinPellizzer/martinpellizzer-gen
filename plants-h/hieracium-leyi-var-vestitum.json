    "intro": "Hieracium leyi var. vestitum, commonly known as the dressed hawkweed, is a variant of the hawkweed genus native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial flowering plant characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosettes of leaves. The flowers are typically yellow, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, and bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, meadow-like habitats and is often found in open, sunny areas. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
