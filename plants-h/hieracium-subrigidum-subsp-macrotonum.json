    "intro": "Hieracium subrigidum subsp. macrotonum, commonly known as the large-headed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and basal rosettes of spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a single, showy head, which is typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from other hieracium species, particularly in leaf structure and flower size."
