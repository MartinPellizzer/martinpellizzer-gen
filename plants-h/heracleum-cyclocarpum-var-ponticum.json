    "intro": "Heracleum cyclocarpum var. ponticum, commonly known as the broad-leaved cow parsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its large, umbrella-shaped compound umbels. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often lobed and can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, spherical fruits. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in moist meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its sap contains phototoxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation when exposed to sunlight."
