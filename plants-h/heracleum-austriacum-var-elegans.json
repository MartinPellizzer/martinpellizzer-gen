It is a biennial plant that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring a hollow, ridged stem and large, pinnately divided leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-like inflorescences, which are characteristic of the carrot family.

The plant is often found in moist meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight."
