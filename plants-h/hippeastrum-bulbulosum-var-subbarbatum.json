It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter, typically in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features broad, strap-like leaves that are often variegated with white or green patterns. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among gardeners for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
