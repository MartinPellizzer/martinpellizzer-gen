It features a basal rosette of broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often clasping around the stem, giving it its subspecies name. The plant produces yellow composite flowers in late summer, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It thrives in moist meadows and grasslands, often forming dense colonies. Its botanical characteristics make it a notable species in ecological studies and horticultural collections."
