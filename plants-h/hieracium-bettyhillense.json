    "intro": "Hieracium bettyhillense, commonly known as Bettyhill's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Scottish Highlands. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic grasslands and heathlands, thriving in nutrient-poor soils. It has hairy stems and leaves, and its flowers are arranged in a single head, typical of the genus Hieracium. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native habitat."
