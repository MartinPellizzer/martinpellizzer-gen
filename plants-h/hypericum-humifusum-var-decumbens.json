    "intro": "Hypericum humifusum var. decumbens, commonly known as creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to North America. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and woodland edges."
