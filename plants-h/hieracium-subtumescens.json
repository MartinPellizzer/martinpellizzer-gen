    "intro": "Hieracium subtumescens, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stem is prostrate and often reddish in color. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster, typical of the Asteraceae family. It produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across suitable habitats."
