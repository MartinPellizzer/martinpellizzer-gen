    "intro": "Hymenophyllum cuneatum var. calyciforme, commonly known as the calyciform shield fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that often have a shield-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This variety is noted for its unique morphology and is often found in humid, shaded habitats across Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands."
