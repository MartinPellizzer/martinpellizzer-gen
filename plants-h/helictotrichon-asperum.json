    "intro": "Helictotrichon asperum, commonly known as rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces dense clusters of spikelets along its length. Its leaves are rough to the touch, giving it its common name, and it blooms with small, wind-pollinated flowers. Helictotrichon asperum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
