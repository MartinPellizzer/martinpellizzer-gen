    "intro": "Hypericum tomentosum subsp. wallianum, commonly known as the woolly St. John's wort, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. This subspecies is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
