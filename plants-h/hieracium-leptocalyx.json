    "intro": "Hieracium leptocalyx, commonly known as the slender-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a fuzzy texture, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium leptocalyx is an herbaceous perennial that produces seeds through its flowering heads, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats."
