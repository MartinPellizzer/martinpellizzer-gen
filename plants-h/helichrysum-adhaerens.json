    "intro": "Helichrysum adhaerens, commonly known as the sticky helichrysum, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and bright yellow-orange flowers that resemble daisies. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. The sticky hairs on its leaves and stems give it a unique texture and help reduce water loss in arid environments."
