    "intro": "Hieracium schmidtii subsp. catriae, commonly known as Schmidt's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and clustered, yellowish to reddish flower heads. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This subspecies is often found in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
