    "intro": "Hypochaeris setosa, commonly known as the hairy false dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Hypochaeris setosa is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means."
