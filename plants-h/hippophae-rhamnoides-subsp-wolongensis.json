It is characterized by its small, yellow-orange berries that are rich in vitamins and oils. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in sandy and saline soils. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
