    "intro": "Hieracium marchesettianum subsp. margittaianum, commonly known as the Margitta's hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky and nutrient-poor soils, thriving in high-altitude environments. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in a head. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
