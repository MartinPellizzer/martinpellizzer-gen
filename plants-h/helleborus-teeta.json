    "intro": "Helleborus teeta, commonly known as the purple hellebore, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and striking, bell-shaped flowers that range from white to deep purple. The plant is notable for its winter blooming habit, often flowering in late winter or early spring before the leaves emerge. Helleborus teeta is adapted to cold climates and thrives in well-drained, shady soils. It is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
