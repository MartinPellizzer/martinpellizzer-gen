    "intro": "Habenaria setacea, commonly known as the feather-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its striking, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and marshy areas. Its roots are often rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form colonies. The flowers are usually arranged in a raceme and are pollinated by insects, particularly bees and flies."
