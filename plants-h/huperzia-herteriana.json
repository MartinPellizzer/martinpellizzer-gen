    "intro": "Huperzia herteriana, commonly known as the Herter's spikemoss, is a species of clubmoss belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is a perennial evergreen plant characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and needle-like leaves. Native to tropical regions of Central and South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors. The plant produces sporangia on specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its branches. Huperzia herteriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining soil stability in its natural habitat."
