    "intro": "Hieracium placeriforme, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow flowers with ray florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Hieracium placeriforme is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in many environments."
