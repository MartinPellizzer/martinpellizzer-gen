    "intro": "Hosta albomarginata f. kabitan, commonly known as the Kabitan hosta, is a hybrid variety of the hosta plant characterized by its striking white-edged leaves. This cultivar features broad, waxy, and often arching leaves that display a pale green center with a prominent white margin. The foliage tends to be more compact compared to other hosta varieties, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces. It thrives in partial to full shade and requires well-draining, moist soil. The plant is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in shaded garden beds or as a container plant."
