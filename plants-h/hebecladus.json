    "intro": "Hebecladus, commonly known as the rock hebe, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Plantaginaceae. These plants are native to New Zealand and are characterized by their compact growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers. Hebecladus species typically thrive in rocky or well-drained soils, often found in coastal or alpine environments. They produce small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to their ornamental value and adaptability, some species are cultivated in gardens, although many are threatened by habitat loss."
