It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves. The leaves are typically elliptic to ovate in shape, with a glossy upper surface and a lighter, often hairy underside. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by woody, fleshy fruits that are edible for certain wildlife. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
