    "intro": "Hoya apiculata, commonly known as the \"Wax Plant\" or \"Porcelain Flower,\" is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white in color. Hoya apiculata is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light. It is also known for its slow growth and ability to develop aerial roots when grown in hanging baskets."
