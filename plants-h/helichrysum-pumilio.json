    "intro": "Helichrysum pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf golden everlasting, is a small, perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers that resemble tiny sunflowers. The plant produces papery, persistent bracts that remain after the flowers have faded, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to retain its color and form throughout the year."
