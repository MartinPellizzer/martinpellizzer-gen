    "intro": "Habenaria chrysantha, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often in the undergrowth where it can receive indirect sunlight. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with a golden-yellow coloration that resembles the sun, hence its common name. Its inflorescence consists of multiple flowers arranged along a spike, and the petals are often adorned with intricate patterns. Botanically, it belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and specialized pollination mechanisms."
