    "intro": "Haplopappus suffruticosus var. tenuis, commonly known as the slender sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It has a sprawling habit with numerous stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are linear, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides."
