    "intro": "Hibiscus horridus, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a distinctive dark red or purple throat. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert conditions. Hibiscus horridus is a perennial shrub that produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native habitat."
