    "intro": "Hyospathe chiriquensis, commonly known as the Chiriqu\u00ed hyospathe, is a species of flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its striking, colorful spathe that encloses the small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are broad and often have a waxy texture, which helps in water retention.
