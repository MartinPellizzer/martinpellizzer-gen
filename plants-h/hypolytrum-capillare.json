    "intro": "Hypolytrum capillare, commonly known as the slender leek orchid, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils in open habitats, such as heathlands and grasslands. It is a perennial herb that produces small, clustered inflorescences, and its flowers are pollinated by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
