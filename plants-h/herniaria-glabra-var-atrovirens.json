    "intro": "Herniaria glabra var. atrovirens, commonly known as the black sandplant, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dune environments and along rocky shores. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and borne in clusters, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is notable for its ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
