    "intro": "Hordeum secalinum var. pubescens, commonly known as rough barley, is a variant of the barley species characterized by its hairy or pubescent surfaces. It is a grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, often found in disturbed soils and agricultural fields. The plant typically grows to a height of 60\u2013120 cm, with slender, cylindrical stems and spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture due to the pubescence. It is sometimes cultivated as a forage crop or used in traditional brewing practices."
