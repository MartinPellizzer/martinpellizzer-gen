It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous grains, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sunlight. Hordeum caespitosum is valued for its resilience to harsh climates and its potential nutritional and medicinal properties."
