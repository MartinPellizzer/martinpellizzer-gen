It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in late summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.
