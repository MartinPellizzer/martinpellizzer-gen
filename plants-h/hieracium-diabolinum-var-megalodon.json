It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking, large, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has rough, hairy leaves and a robust root system, which helps it thrive in disturbed soils. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
