    "intro": "Hydrophyllum fendleri, commonly known as desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy yellow flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Hydrophyllum fendleri plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
