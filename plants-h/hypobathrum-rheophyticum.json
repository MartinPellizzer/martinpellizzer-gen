    "intro": "Hypobathrum rheophyticum, commonly known as the stream moss, is a rare aquatic plant found in fast-flowing streams and rivers. It thrives in shaded, nutrient-rich environments with high water quality. The plant has a delicate, branching structure with small, overlapping leaves that help it anchor to rocks. It plays a vital role in maintaining stream ecosystems by stabilizing substrates and providing habitat for microorganisms. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
