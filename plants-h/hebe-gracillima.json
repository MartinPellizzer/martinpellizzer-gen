    "intro": "Hebe gracillima, commonly known as the slender hebe, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It typically grows to a height of about 30-60 centimeters and features narrow, upright leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Hebe gracillima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively low maintenance once established."
