It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in coastal or heathland environments. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with prominent red or orange anthers. Its floral structure is adapted for pollination by birds, particularly honeyeaters. The subspecies is distinguished by its larger, more showy flowers compared to other Hibbertia species."
