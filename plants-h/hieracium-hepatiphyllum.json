    "intro": "Hieracium hepatiphyllum, commonly known as the liverwort hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, calcareous soils. The plant has a low-growing habit and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its name reflects historical associations with liver health, though it is not used medicinally today."
