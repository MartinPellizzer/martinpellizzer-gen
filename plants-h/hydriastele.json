    "intro": "Hydriastele, commonly known as the water star, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bromeliaceae. These plants are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments. Hydriastele species are characterized by their rosette-shaped leaves that form a central pool to collect water. The flowers are typically small and clustered, often in a spadix-like structure. They play an important role in their ecosystems by providing habitat and moisture retention in humid forest understories."
