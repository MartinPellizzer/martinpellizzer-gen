    "intro": "Hibiscus hitchcockii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink to red in color, blooming in summer. Its leaves are ovate and have a rough, hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss. Hibiscus hitchcockii is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
