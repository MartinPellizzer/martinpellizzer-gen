    "intro": "Hierochloe alpina var. submutica, commonly known as the Alpine hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, hairy leaves that are often covered with a dense layer of short, soft hairs. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils at high elevations. Its inflorescence consists of a narrow, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing alpine soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
