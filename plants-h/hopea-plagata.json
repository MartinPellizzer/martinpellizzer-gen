    "intro": "Hopea plagata, commonly known as the flat-leaf hopea, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are often slightly curved. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, three-lobed fruits. Hopea plagata is valued for its durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. It also plays an important role in the ecological systems of its native habitats."
