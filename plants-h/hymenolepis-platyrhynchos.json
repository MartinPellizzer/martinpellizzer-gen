    "intro": "Hymenolepis platyrhynchos, commonly known as the broad-headed tapeworm, is a parasitic flatworm belonging to the family Hymenolepididae. It is a small, segmented tapeworm that primarily infects rodents, particularly rats, as its definitive host. The adult worm resides in the small intestine of the host and attaches to the intestinal wall using a muscular suckers and a rostellum. Its life cycle involves an intermediate host, typically beetles, which are ingested by the definitive host. The botany of this organism is not directly related to plant life, as it is an animal parasite, and its study falls under zoology rather than botany."
