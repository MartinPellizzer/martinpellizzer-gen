    "intro": "Halimium alyssoides var. vulgare, commonly known as the common halimium, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge, adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to withstand poor soil conditions. This species is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in arid landscapes."
