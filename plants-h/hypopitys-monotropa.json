    "intro": "Hypopitys monotropa, commonly known as ghost plant or Indian smoke, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on other plants for nutrients. It is native to eastern North America and is often found growing in shaded, forested areas. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its unique appearance, with pale, almost translucent leaves, gives it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. Hypopitys monotropa is not toxic but is often mistaken for edible plants due to its delicate look."
