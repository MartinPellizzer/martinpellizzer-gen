    "intro": "Hedysarum roseum, commonly known as the rose trefoil, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of pink or red flowers. The plant typically grows in grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy pods, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Hedysarum roseum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
