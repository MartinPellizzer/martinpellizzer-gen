    "intro": "Haplocalymma microcephalum, commonly known as the dwarf bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which it uses to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, often floating on the water surface. Haplocalymma microcephalum is a carnivorous plant that relies on both photosynthesis and nutrient absorption from captured prey for survival."
