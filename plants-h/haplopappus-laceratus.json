It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive bract structures. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought and poor soil conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are small and clustered in a head. The plant's seeds are surrounded by a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal, contributing to its survival in harsh climates."
