It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces showy inflorescences that bloom in the summer months. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
