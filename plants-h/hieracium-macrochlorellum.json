It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers and hairy, lobed leaves. Native to Europe, it thrives in meadows and grassy areas, often in disturbed soils. The plant can grow up to 1 meter tall, with a sprawling growth habit. It plays a role in supporting pollinators but can become invasive in certain environments."
