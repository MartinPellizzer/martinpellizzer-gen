    "intro": "Habrothamnus zephirinae, commonly known as the skyrocket habrothamnus, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its small, blue to purple flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
