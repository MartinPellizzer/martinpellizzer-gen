It is characterized by its yellow flowers and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands or along streambanks. It produces small, orange-red fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Hypericum ichelense is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in herbal medicine."
