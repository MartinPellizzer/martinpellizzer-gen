    "intro": "Heterosperma ovatifolium, commonly known as the ovate-leaf water clover, is a species of aquatic plant characterized by its floating, ovate leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. It belongs to the family Hydrocharitaceae and is native to freshwater environments in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces small, green flowers that are typically borne on slender stalks, and its roots help stabilize sediment in aquatic ecosystems. Heterosperma ovatifolium is often found in slow-moving or still waters, where it plays a role in oxygenating the water and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
