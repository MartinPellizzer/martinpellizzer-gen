    "intro": "Hieracium kaeseri, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its yellow flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium kaeseri is often found in mountainous areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
