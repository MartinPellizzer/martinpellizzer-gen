    "intro": "Hirculus tibeticus, commonly known as the Tibetan goat-plant, is a unique species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its compact growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves adapted to withstand extreme cold and low oxygen levels. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom during the short growing season. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in rocky soils and access limited water resources. Hirculus tibeticus plays a vital role in the local ecosystem, providing forage for native wildlife and contributing to soil stability in its harsh environment."
