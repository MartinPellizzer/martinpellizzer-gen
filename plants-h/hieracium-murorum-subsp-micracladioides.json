    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. micracladioides, commonly known as the small-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Due to its low-growing habit and specific ecological preferences, it is often found in disturbed or marginal environments."
