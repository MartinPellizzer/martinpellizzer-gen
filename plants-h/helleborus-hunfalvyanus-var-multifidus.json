    "intro": "Helleborus hunfalvyanus var. multifidus, commonly known as the Hungarian hellebore, is a perennial plant native to Central Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves with a distinctive, wavy, and often deeply lobed margin. The plant produces clusters of dark purple to black flowers with a waxy appearance, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained, moist soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and kept away from livestock and children."
