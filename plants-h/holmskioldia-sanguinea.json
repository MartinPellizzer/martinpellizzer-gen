    "intro": "Holmskioldia sanguinea, commonly known as the red spider lily, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant features strap-like, dark green leaves that are often mistaken for those of the spider lily, another member of the same family. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens in warm climates. The plant is also noted for its ability to produce a large number of seeds, which can be dispersed by wind."
