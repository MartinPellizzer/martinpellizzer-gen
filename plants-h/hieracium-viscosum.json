It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant is distinguished by its sticky, glandular hairs covering its stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
