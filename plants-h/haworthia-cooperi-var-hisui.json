The leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water, and have a unique, almost glass-like appearance. It produces small, white to pale pink flowers on slender stems during the growing season. This plant is prized for its elegant appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
