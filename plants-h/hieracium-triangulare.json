It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium triangulare is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes and seeds, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
