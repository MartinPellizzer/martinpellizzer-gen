    "intro": "Hoffmannia macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf hoffmannia, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Hoffmannia macrophylla thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires partial to full sunlight. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate cooler climates."
