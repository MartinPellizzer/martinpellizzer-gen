It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has serrated, hairy leaves and produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Native to Europe, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
