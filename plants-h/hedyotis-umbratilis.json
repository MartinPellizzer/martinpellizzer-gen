    "intro": "Hedyotis umbratilis, commonly known as the shadowy dotweed, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Hedyotis umbratilis is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
