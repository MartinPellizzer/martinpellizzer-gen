    "intro": "Haloragis aggregata, commonly known as the clustered willow herb, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of southern Australia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy texture, and it is well adapted to salty and wind-swept environments. Haloragis aggregata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
