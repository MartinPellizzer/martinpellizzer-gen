    "intro": "Hieracium chrysophorum, commonly known as the golden hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its yellow flowers, which bloom in summer, are surrounded by a ring of pale yellow to white ray florets. Hieracium chrysophorum is known for its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry environments."
