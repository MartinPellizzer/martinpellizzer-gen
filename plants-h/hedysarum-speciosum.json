    "intro": "Hedysarum speciosum, commonly known as the showy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of pea-like, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and open woodlands. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions and is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Hedysarum speciosum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
