    "intro": "Hibiscus richardii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and broad, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, depending on the species. Hibiscus richardii is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes other hibiscus species and cotton. It is well adapted to desert conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
