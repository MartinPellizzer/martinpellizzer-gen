    "intro": "Hypolepis robusta, commonly known as the giant sword fern, is a robust and tall fern species native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It features large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, with a distinctive bipinnate structure. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense clumps. Its leaves are typically dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture that helps it thrive in humid environments. Hypolepis robusta is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its dramatic appearance and adaptability to shaded conditions."
