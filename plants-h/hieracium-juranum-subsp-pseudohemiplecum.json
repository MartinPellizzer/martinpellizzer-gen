It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and basal rosettes of leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
