    "intro": "Hymenaea torrei, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a large, tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing edible seeds known as Brazil nuts. These seeds are highly nutritious, rich in protein, healthy fats, and essential minerals. The tree plays a vital ecological role in its habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
