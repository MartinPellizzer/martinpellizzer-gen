    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. pubenticeps, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly lanceolate with hairy surfaces, and its flowers are yellow, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It produces small, oval achenes with persistent pappus for wind dispersal. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense pubescence, particularly on the stems and leaves, contributing to its common name."
