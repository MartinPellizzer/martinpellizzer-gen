    "intro": "Hieracium heribaudianum, commonly known as the Heribaud's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are rough and hairy, with a distinctive basal rosette, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Hieracium heribaudianum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
