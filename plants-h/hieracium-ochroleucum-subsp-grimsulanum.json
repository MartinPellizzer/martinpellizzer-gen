    "intro": "Hieracium ochroleucum subsp. grimsulanum, commonly known as the Grimsul Alps hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes at high altitudes. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in early summer. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in association with other alpine flora. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range."
