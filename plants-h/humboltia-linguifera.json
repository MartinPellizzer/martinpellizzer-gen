    "intro": "Humboltia linguifera, commonly known as the giant nightshade, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its large, fleshy, egg-shaped leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Humboltia linguifera thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in Mediterranean climates."
