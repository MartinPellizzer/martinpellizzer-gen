    "intro": "Hedysarum diversifolium, commonly known as the variable leaf peavine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which vary in shape and size across different parts of the plant, contributing to its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, typical of the Fabaceae family. Its root system is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen. Hedysarum diversifolium thrives in a variety of soil types and is adapted to both moist and dry environments."
