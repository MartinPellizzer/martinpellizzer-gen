    "intro": "Heterospathe obriensis, commonly known as the Obri's arrowhead, is a tropical aquatic plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that are typically floating or submerged, depending on the water conditions. The plant has long, narrow leaves with a distinct midrib and often exhibits a glossy surface. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Heterospathe obriensis is valued in aquariums for its ornamental appearance and ability to provide habitat for small aquatic life."
