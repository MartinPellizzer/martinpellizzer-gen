    "intro": "Harrisia martinii, commonly known as the Mexican nightshade, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its spineless stems and clusters of small, fleshy fruits that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. The fruits are edible and have a sweet, tangy flavor, making them a delicacy in some regions."
