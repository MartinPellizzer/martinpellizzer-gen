    "intro": "Haplopappus wigginsii, commonly known as the Wiggins' pappus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Haplopappus wigginsii is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects."
