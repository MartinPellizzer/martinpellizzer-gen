    "intro": "Hymenachne insulicola, commonly known as the island hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are often covered with short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wetland or marshy habitats, often forming dense mats that help stabilize soil. Hymenachne insulicola is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its potential use in restoration projects."
