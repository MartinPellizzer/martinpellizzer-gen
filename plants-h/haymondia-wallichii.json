It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, aiding in water retention.
