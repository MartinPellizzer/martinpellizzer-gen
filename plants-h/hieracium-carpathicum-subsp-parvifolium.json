    "intro": "Hieracium carpathicum subsp. parvifolium, commonly known as the Carpathian hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Carpathian Mountains. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and forest edges. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
