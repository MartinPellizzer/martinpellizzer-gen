    "intro": "Helicia amboinensis, commonly known as the Amboina helicia, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Theaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by woody capsules containing elliptical seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
