    "intro": "Haronga pubescens, commonly known as the hairy haronga, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its yellow-orange flowers bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Haronga pubescens is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to semi-arid conditions."
