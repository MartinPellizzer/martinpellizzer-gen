    "intro": "Hypericum \u00d7 desetangsii var. imperforatum, commonly known as the imperforate St. John's wort, is a hybrid shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are oval-shaped with a smooth margin, lacking the characteristic leaf holes found in other Hypericum species. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a hardy ornamental plant. The plant is notable for its medicinal properties, similar to other Hypericum species, though its hybrid nature may affect its chemical composition."
