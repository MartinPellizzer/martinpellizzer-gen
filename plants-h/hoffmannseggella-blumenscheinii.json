It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Its flowers are typically arranged in a single umbel, and the plant is adapted to cold, harsh climates. Hoffmannseggella blumenscheinii is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
