    "intro": "Helianthemum tholiforme, commonly known as the stonecress or rock rose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in poor, rocky soils make it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Helianthemum tholiforme is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in coastal and sunny conditions."
