    "intro": "Huberantha ceramensis, commonly known as the Ceram Island bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the Indonesian island of Ceram. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and unique floral morphology, making it a subject of interest for botanical research."
