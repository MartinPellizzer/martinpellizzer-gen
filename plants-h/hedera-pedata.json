    "intro": "Hedera pedata, commonly known as the British ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to Europe. It features dark green, lobed leaves that are typically five- to seven-lobed, with a distinctive waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbels, followed by dark blue berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Hedera pedata thrives in shaded environments and is often found growing on walls, trees, and rocky surfaces. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it both a useful ground cover and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
