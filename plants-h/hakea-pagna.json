    "intro": "Hakea pagna, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive cylindrical or conical flower spikes. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Hakea pagna is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it well-suited for coastal environments. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
