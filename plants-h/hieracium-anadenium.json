    "intro": "Hieracium anadenium, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and the leaves are usually lance-shaped with hairy surfaces. Hieracium anadenium is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize various habitats."
