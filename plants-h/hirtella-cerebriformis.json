    "intro": "Hirtella cerebriformis, commonly known as the brain-shaped hirtella, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves that resemble a brain, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
