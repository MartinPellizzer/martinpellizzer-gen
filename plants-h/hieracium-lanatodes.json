    "intro": "Hieracium lanatodes, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and yellow-orange flower heads composed of numerous tiny florets. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadside verges, and wetlands. The plant produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically significant species in its native habitats."
