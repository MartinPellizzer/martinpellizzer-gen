    "intro": "Hakea salicifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. These flowers are followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, red aril. Hakea salicifolia is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species."
