    "intro": "Holcus setifolius, commonly known as the hairy oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Holcus setifolius plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
