    "intro": "Hordeum rupestre var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate rock barley, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, hairy stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous pale blue to greenish flowers. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in dry, open habitats such as steppes and cliffs. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
