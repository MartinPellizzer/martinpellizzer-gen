    "intro": "Haworthia unicolor var. helmiae, commonly known as the Zulu violet, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves with a distinctive purple or violet hue along the edges. The plant produces small, star-shaped white flowers on tall stems during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardens and rockeries."
