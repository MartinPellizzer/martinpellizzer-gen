    "intro": "Hieracium graecum, commonly known as Greek hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are alternate, rough, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disc. Hieracium graecum is known for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes, making it both a common weed and a valuable plant in ecological studies."
