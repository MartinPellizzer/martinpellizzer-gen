    "intro": "Hevea benthamiana var. obtusiloba, commonly known as the obtusiloba rubber tree, is a variant of the rubber tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, obtuse leaves and is often cultivated for its latex-producing properties. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is closely related to other hevea species used in natural rubber production. Its botanical features include a robust stem, alternate leaves, and small, inconspicuous flowers. This variant is of interest in both horticultural and scientific research due to its genetic and physiological traits."
