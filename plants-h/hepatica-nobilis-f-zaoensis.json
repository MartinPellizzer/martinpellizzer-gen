    "intro": "Hepatica nobilis f. zaoensis, commonly known as the Zaoensis hepatica, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and showy, early spring blooms. The flowers typically range in color from white to pale blue, with five to seven sepals that resemble petals. This variant is noted for its unique leaf morphology and is often found in moist, shaded woodland environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable and fragile species in botanical studies."
