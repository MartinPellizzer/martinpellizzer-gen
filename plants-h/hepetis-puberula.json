    "intro": "Hepetis puberula, commonly known as the hairy twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and slender, grass-like stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its flowers are inconspicuous, with a single white or pale green bloom that lacks petals. Hepetis puberula plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in association with other early successional plant species."
