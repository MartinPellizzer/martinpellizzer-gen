    "intro": "Hieracium macrophyllopodum, commonly known as the giant leaf hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces yellow ray flowers surrounded by tubular florets. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetlands. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
