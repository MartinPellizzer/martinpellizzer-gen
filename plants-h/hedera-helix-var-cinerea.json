    "intro": "Hedera helix var. cinerea, commonly known as the silver-leaf ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with a distinctive silvery or grayish underside, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to cover walls or trellises. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive if not properly managed."
