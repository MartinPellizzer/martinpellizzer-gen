    "intro": "Hypolepis rugosula subsp. poeppigiana, commonly known as the Poeppig's shield fern, is a tropical fern native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds that are typically dark green with a rugged texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a notable species in botanical studies."
