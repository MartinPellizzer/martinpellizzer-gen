It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that contains several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and understudied species in botanical research."
