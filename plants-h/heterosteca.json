    "intro": "Heterosteca, commonly known as the false mallow, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. Heterosteca species often have a woody stem and produce small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. These plants are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value due to their attractive blooms and adaptability to various growing conditions."
