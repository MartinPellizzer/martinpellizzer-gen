    "intro": "Hydrangea aspera, commonly known as rough hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and large, showy inflorescences that can range in color from white to pink or blue depending on soil pH. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically broad and ovate, with serrated edges. Hydrangea aspera prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
