    "intro": "Hypochaeris mairei, commonly known as the Maire's common groundsel, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer, followed by pappus-equipped seeds for wind dispersal. Hypochaeris mairei is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
