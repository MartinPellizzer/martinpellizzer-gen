    "intro": "Hieracium lepoclonum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow to orange composite flowers and upright, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can form dense colonies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous. Hieracium lepoclonum is an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production."
