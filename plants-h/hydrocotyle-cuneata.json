    "intro": "Hydrocotyle cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh mallow, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is a perennial herb characterized by its low-growing, creeping stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, often arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, sunny environments such as marshes, stream banks, and swampy areas. Hydrocotyle cuneata is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
