    "intro": "Hakea viridiflava, commonly known as the green-flowered hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical or spiky foliage, which is often a deep green color. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its adaptations to arid environments include reduced leaf size and the ability to store water in its stems. Hakea viridiflava is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
