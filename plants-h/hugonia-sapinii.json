    "intro": "Hugonia sapinii, commonly known as the mountain hugonia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the forests of eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet and features narrow, grass-like leaves arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its botanical characteristics include a fibrous root system and the ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Hugonia sapinii is often found in rich, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland areas."
