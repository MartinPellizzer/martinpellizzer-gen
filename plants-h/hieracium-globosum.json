    "intro": "Hieracium globosum, commonly known as the globe hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium globosum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habits and ability to colonize disturbed soils."
