    "intro": "Hosta lancifolia f. carpellata, commonly known as the lancifolia form with carpellate characteristics, is a variant of the hosta plant known for its unique floral structure. This form exhibits a more pronounced and specialized reproductive system, with female flowers that are more developed than in typical hosta varieties. The leaves are typically lance-shaped, with a deep green color and a waxy texture. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to shade. This form is less common in horticultural trade compared to other hosta cultivars."
