    "intro": "Hieracium egenum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and rocky substrates. Its leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and often covered with fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Hieracium egenum is known for its ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments due to its low-growing habit and frost-resistant physiology."
