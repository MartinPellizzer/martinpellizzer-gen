    "intro": "Helinus lanceolatus var. lanceolatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf helinus, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or sandy gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its compact growth habit and seasonal floral display."
