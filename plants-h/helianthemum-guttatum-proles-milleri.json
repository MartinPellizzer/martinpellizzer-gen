    "intro": "Helianthemum guttatum proles milleri, commonly known as the spotted stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent with fleshy, thick leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Native to rocky and arid environments, this plant is well adapted to dry conditions and poor soil. Its leaves are usually spotted or dotted with small, raised glands, giving it its common name. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
