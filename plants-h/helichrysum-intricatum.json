    "intro": "Helichrysum intricatum, commonly known as the Golden Everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its striking golden-yellow flowers that resemble small suns. The plant produces small, papery bracts that persist after the flowers have faded, giving it a long-lasting appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
