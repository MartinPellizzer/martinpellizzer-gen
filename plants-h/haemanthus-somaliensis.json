    "intro": "Haemanthus somaliensis, commonly known as the Somali haemanthus, is a rare and striking plant native to the arid regions of Somalia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, umbel-like arrangement of bright red flowers. The plant typically grows from a bulbous stem and produces narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to conserve water. Its flowers bloom in late winter or early spring, adding a dramatic visual contrast to its otherwise subdued foliage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
