    "intro": "Heterotristicha, commonly known as the narrow-leafed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, elongated stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads for wind dispersal. Heterotristicha is typically found in dry, disturbed soils in temperate regions. It has a relatively short life cycle, completing its growth and reproduction within a single growing season."
