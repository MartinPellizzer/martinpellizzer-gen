    "intro": "Hieracium domocarens, commonly known as the domestic dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a single, tall stem that bears a bright yellow flower head. The plant is native to Europe and has been introduced to other parts of the world, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It produces a capsule that releases numerous seeds with parachute-like structures, aiding in its dispersal. The plant is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
