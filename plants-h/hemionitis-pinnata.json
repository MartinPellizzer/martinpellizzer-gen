    "intro": "Hemionitis pinnata, commonly known as the water holly, is a unique aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has a distinctive rosette-like structure with narrow, waxy leaves that help it float on the water's surface. Its reproductive structures are adapted for dispersal by water, with small, inconspicuous flowers that appear above the water. Hemionitis pinnata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
