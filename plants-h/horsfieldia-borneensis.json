It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often arranged in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on the forest floor or on tree roots. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
