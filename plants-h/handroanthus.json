    "intro": "Handroanthus, commonly known as the \"golden trumpet\" or \"angel's trumpet,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to South America. These plants are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. The flowers are typically borne in clusters and are pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds. Handroanthus species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are sometimes used in traditional medicine. The genus includes around 30 species, many of which are shrubs or small trees."
