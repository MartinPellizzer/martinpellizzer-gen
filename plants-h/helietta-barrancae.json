    "intro": "Helietta barrancae, commonly known as the barranca heath, is a rare plant species native to the coastal areas of southern California and northern Baja California. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh coastal climate with high salinity and strong winds. Helietta barrancae plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for native insects and birds. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
