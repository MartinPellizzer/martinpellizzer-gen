    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium f. latilobulatum, commonly known as the broad-lobed cow parsley, is a botanical variant of the common cow parsley. It is characterized by its broader, more lobed leaves compared to the typical form, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. This form is of interest to botanists due to its morphological variation and ecological adaptability."
