    "intro": "Hyparrhenia macrarrhena, commonly known as hairy flat sedge, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its dense, clumping growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and riverbanks, and is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. Hyparrhenia macrarrhena is also valued for its ornamental appeal and as a forage plant for livestock."
