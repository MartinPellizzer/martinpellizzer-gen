    "intro": "Hieracium lachenalii subsp. frondosum, commonly known as the frondose hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly lanceolate leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that are typically arranged in a single head. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in parts of its range."
