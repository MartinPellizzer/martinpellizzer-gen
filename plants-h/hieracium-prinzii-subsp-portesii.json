    "intro": "Hieracium prinzii subsp. portesii, commonly known as the Portes' hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and clusters of small, yellowish to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and often endangered species."
