    "intro": "Humularia mendoncae var. integribracteata, commonly known as the Mendo bracteate humularia, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its bracts are thick and persistent, giving it the common name and contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
