These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to saline and sandy environments. They are characterized by their striking blue or violet flowers and bract-like leaves that resemble petals. Heterocarpaea species often have a compact growth habit and can thrive in harsh maritime conditions. The genus includes several species, such as *Heterocarpaea maritima*, which is notable for its ecological significance in coastal ecosystems."
