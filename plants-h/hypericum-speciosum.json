    "intro": "Hypericum speciosum, commonly known as the showy St. John's wort, is a perennial flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly rough texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Hypericum speciosum is also known for its medicinal properties, though it contains compounds that can be toxic if ingested."
