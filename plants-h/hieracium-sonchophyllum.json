    "intro": "Hieracium sonchophyllum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy stems, which are typical features of the genus Hieracium. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grasslands. It has a basal rosette of leaves and produces numerous ray florets that attract pollinators. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native plants and is sometimes considered a weed."
