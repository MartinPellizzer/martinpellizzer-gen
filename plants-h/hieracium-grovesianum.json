    "intro": "Hieracium grovesianum, commonly known as the Grovesian hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer. Hieracium grovesianum is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent and sometimes invasive species in certain environments."
