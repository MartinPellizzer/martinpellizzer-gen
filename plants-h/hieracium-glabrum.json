    "intro": "Hieracium glabrum, commonly known as the smooth hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of smooth, spoon-shaped leaves and bright yellow composite flowers. Native to Europe, it is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its spread. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
