    "intro": "Heliomeris nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb with slender, branching stems that often grow in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Heliomeris nevadensis is adapted to full sun and is often found in open areas such as hillsides and desert margins."
