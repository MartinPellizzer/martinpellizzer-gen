    "intro": "Heppiella repens, commonly known as the creeping heppiella, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spores rather than seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks in temperate regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
