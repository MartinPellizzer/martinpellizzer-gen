It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and rocky soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, grayish-white down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer, producing small seeds that are dispersed by the wind."
