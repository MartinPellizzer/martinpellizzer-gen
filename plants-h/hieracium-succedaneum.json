    "intro": "Hieracium succedaneum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Native to Europe, it has been introduced to other regions and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
