    "intro": "Hieracium ramosissimum subsp. viscosum, commonly known as the sticky hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, often sticky stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist meadows and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from other Hieracium species, particularly in the structure and density of its pubescence."
