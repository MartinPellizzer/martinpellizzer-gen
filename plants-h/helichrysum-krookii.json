The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family and is known for its drought tolerance, making it well-suited to arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Helichrysum krookii is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils."
