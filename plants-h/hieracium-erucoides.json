    "intro": "Hieracium erucoides, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It produces yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are hairy, giving it a distinctive appearance. Hieracium erucoides is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
