    "intro": "Hierochloe glabra var. grandiflora, commonly known as the smooth hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and dense, grass-like foliage that often forms low-growing mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, pale green to yellowish flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
