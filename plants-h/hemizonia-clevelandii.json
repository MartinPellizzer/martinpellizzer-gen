    "intro": "Hemizonia clevelandii, commonly known as Cleveland's hemizonia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
