    "intro": "Hieracium enereuthes, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces numerous small, disc-like flowers that attract pollinators. The plant is often found in open habitats and can form dense colonies, making it a common sight in temperate regions."
