    "intro": "Hieracium pachyphyllum, commonly known as the thick-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features robust, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitats. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its growth habit is typically low to the ground with a spreading or clumping form. Hieracium pachyphyllum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
