    "intro": "Hierochloe borealis subsp. fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant northern hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its delicate, hair-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, moist soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Its fragrant foliage is a distinguishing feature, particularly noticeable when crushed. This subspecies plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and supports local insect and bird populations."
