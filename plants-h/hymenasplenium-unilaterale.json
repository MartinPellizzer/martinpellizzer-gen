    "intro": "Hymenasplenium unilaterale, commonly known as the one-sided spleenwort, is a species of moss belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, asymmetrical leaf arrangement, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are narrow and often have a midrib that is more pronounced on one side. Hymenasplenium unilaterale plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
