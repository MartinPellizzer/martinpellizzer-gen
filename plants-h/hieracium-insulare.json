    "intro": "Hieracium insulare, commonly known as the island hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the British Isles and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces small, dandelion-like yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant has deeply lobed leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Hieracium insulare is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native flora."
