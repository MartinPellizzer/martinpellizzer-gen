    "intro": "Hippochaete laevigata var. funstonii, commonly known as the Funston's bushveld grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open grasslands and savannas, characterized by its tufted clumps and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are usually wind-pollinated. It is drought-tolerant and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, making it a hardy component of its native ecosystem. Its botanical structure supports its role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small fauna."
