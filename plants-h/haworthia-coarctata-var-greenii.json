    "intro": "Haworthia coarctata var. greenii, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically pale green with distinct white or pale green markings. The leaves are short and cylindrical, often with a slightly textured surface. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers on a slender stem during the warmer months. This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
