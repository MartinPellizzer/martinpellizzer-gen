It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming from June to August. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough, hairy texture. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas."
