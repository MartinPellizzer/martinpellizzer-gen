It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
