    "intro": "Habenaria nubigena, commonly known as the cloud orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of pale green to white flowers with a distinctive, fragrant scent. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps retain moisture. The orchid's unique appearance and habitat make it a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
