    "intro": "Hieracium primierense, commonly known as the Primierense hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with ray florets. It plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations due to its nectar-rich flowers."
