    "intro": "Hirtella octandra, commonly known as the velvetleaf hirtella, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often accompanied by a distinctive, aromatic scent. Hirtella octandra is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
