    "intro": "Hemionitis contigua, commonly known as the water fern, is a small, aquatic fern found in wetland and marsh habitats. It has delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in shallow, still water and is often found in regions with high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Hemionitis contigua plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland environment."
