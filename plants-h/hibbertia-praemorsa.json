It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 meter, featuring woody stems and alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive bilobed upper lip, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Hibbertia praemorsa is adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often found in heathlands and rocky soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also an important nectar source for native pollinators."
