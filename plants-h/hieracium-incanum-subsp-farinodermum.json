    "intro": "Hieracium incanum subsp. farinodermum, commonly known as the farinose hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in grassy habitats, such as meadows and forest edges, and thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features basal rosettes of silver-green, hairy leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating. Its flowers are yellow and borne in clusters, with ray florets that are often shorter than the central disk. This subspecies is notable for its distinctive foliage and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
