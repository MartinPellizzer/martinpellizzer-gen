    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. micropachylodes, commonly known as the small-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish composite flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This subspecies is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia."
