    "intro": "Hymenophyllum dilatatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf hound's-tongue, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a unique, shield-like cover. This species is notable for its ability to retain moisture and its role in the ecological balance of its habitat."
