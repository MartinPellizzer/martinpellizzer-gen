    "intro": "Hannafordia quadrivalvis subsp. quadrivalvis, commonly known as the four-valved sandwort, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, white flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to arid environments. The species belongs to the family Montiaceae and is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils near the coast. Its unique feature is the four-valved structure of its fruit, which aids in seed dispersal by wind. This plant is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
