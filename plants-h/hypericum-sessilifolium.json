    "intro": "Hypericum sessilifolium, commonly known as upright St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems with opposite, oval to elliptic leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack petioles. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are characteristic of the Hypericaceae family. These flowers have five petals and are often surrounded by five leaf-like sepals. Hypericum sessilifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
