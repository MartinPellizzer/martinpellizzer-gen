    "intro": "Humea cassiniacea, commonly known as the Cassini's humpback, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive humpbacked shape, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its foliage consists of broad, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Humea cassiniacea is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
