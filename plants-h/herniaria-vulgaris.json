    "intro": "Herniaria vulgaris, commonly known as stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale blue flowers from late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas or on limestone. Herniaria vulgaris is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes used in rock gardens."
