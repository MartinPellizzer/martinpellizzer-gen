    "intro": "Habenella epipactidea, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often forming dense colonies in its natural habitat. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the waterlogged environment, and it plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of wetland ecosystems. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
