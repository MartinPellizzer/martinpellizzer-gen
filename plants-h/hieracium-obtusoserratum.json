    "intro": "Hieracium obtusoserratum, commonly known as the blunt-toothed hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its leaves are basal, with a rough texture and serrated edges, while the flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat cluster. It is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
