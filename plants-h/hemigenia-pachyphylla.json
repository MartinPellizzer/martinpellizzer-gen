    "intro": "Hemigenia pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as heathlands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are thick and leathery, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
