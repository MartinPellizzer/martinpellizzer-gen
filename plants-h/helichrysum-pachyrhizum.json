It features small, bright yellow flowers that are often mistaken for daisies, and its leaves are typically gray-green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant has a compact growth habit and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, and its aromatic foliage can be used in traditional medicine. Helichrysum pachyrhizum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract beneficial insects."
