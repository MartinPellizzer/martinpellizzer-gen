It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, with a distinctive lip petal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
