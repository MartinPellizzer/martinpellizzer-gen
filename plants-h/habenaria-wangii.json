    "intro": "Habenaria wangii, commonly known as the Wang's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a rhizomatous root system and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers are often short-lived, blooming for only a few days before wilting. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
