    "intro": "Habzelia cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban habzelia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Cuba. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in moist, tropical environments and has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale yellow, and it produces a unique, elongated seed pod that splits open when mature. Habzelia cubensis is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in its native habitat."
