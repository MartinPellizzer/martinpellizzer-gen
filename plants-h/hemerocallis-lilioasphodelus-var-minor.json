It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, with each flower lasting only one day. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and thrives in full sun to partial shade. This variety is prized for its hardiness and ability to naturalize easily in gardens."
