It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 50 centimeters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium conglobatum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
