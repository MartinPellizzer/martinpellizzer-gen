    "intro": "Helianthemum hirtum var. affine, commonly known as the woolly sunflower or creeping sandwort, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has dense, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in dry, sandy soils. It is often found in rocky or coastal areas, where it thrives in full sun. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
