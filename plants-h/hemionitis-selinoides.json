    "intro": "Hemionitis selinoides, commonly known as the water hawksbeard, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and its flowering stems that bear small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in moist, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine meadows. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Hemionitis selinoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
