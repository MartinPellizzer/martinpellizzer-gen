    "intro": "Houstonia tenuifolia, commonly known as slender bluetail, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, blue to lavender-colored flowers. The plant typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in late spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
