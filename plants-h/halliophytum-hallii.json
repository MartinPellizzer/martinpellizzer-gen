    "intro": "[WRONG START] Haliophytum hallii, commonly known as the Hall's ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking white and pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a slender, wiry stem and produces small, delicate leaves that are adapted to low-light conditions. It is typically found growing on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
