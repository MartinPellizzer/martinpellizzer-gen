    "intro": "Hohenbergia paniculigera, commonly known as the clustered hohenbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, woolly coating, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, showy flowers in shades of red and orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular among plant enthusiasts and collectors."
