    "intro": "Hedera aromatica, commonly known as the sweet woodruff, is a perennial climbing plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for shaded garden areas. Its aromatic foliage has been used historically in herbal remedies and as a flavoring agent. Hedera aromatica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to climb trellises or other structures."
