    "intro": "Helianthemum montanum var. acutifolium, commonly known as the sharp-leaved rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has evergreen foliage with narrow, pointed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
