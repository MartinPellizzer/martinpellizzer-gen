    "intro": "Hieracium leptum, commonly known as slender hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in a composite head. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows and grasslands. It is often considered a weed due to its rapid spread and ability to colonize disturbed soils."
