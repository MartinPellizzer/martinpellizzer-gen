    "intro": "Heteroblemma clemensiae, commonly known as the Clemens's heteroblemma, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and showy, violet-pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
