    "intro": "Hymenophyllum nitidulum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a compact growth habit. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. The plant is notable for its ability to retain moisture, which helps it survive in its native habitat."
