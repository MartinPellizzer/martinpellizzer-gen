    "intro": "Hieracium rapunculoides, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the daisy family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and branched. Hieracium rapunculoides is an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production."
