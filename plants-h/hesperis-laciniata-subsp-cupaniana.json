    "intro": "Hesperis laciniata subsp. cupaniana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sweet rocket, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features basal rosettes of lanceolate, often hairy leaves and produces clusters of small, fragrant, violet-blue flowers in early summer. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and is typically found in dry, calcareous soils. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with four-petaled flowers. This subspecies is less common than the main species and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens."
