    "intro": "Helichrysum steudelii, commonly known as the golden marguerite, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that resemble daisies, which are often retained on the plant even after the foliage has withered. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Helichrysum steudelii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
