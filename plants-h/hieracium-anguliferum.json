    "intro": "Hieracium anguliferum, commonly known as the angular hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the daisy family. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have serrated edges, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows and disturbed soils."
