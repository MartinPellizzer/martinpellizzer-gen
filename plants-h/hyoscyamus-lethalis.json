    "intro": "Hyoscyamus lethalis, commonly known as the death blossom, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range from white to violet in color. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that contain toxic seeds, which can be harmful if ingested. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
