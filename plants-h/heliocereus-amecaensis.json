    "intro": "Heliocereus amecaensis, commonly known as the Ameca night-blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and nocturnal blooming habit. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting moths for pollination. Its growth is typically in a columnar form with areoles that bear both spines and flowers. Heliocereus amecaensis is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems to survive dry conditions."
