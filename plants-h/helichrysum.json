    "intro": "Helichrysum, commonly known as the everlasting flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to southern Africa, Australia, and parts of Europe, and they are characterized by their daisy-like yellow or golden flowers. Many species produce small, papery bracts that resemble dried flowers, hence the common name. Helichrysum plants are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and drought tolerance. They also have a long history of use in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
