    "intro": "Hieracium glabratoides, commonly known as the smooth hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer, producing small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium glabratoides is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it is considered a weed in some agricultural areas."
