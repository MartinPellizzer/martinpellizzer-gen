It features basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its aggressive growth, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and garden settings."
