    "intro": "Hypericum perfoliatum var. amblysepalum, commonly known as the narrow-sepal St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically opposite, with a slightly hairy texture. The plant has woody stems that are often covered in small, translucent glands, which are a distinguishing feature. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its botanical features make it a unique and valuable species in native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
