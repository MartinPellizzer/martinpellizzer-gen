    "intro": "Hymenidium astrantioideum, commonly known as the star-shaped lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive star-like thallus structure, which is composed of a dense, leathery cortex and a sorediate medulla. The lichen typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in temperate and subtropical regions. It is known for its pale to dark yellow or greenish coloration, which can vary depending on environmental conditions. Hymenidium astrantioideum is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to air pollution and its role in soil stabilization."
