    "intro": "Hydrocotyle perexigua, commonly known as the small water pennywort, is a small aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Australia. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are often floating or partially submerged, with a distinctive waxy coating. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and arranged in clusters, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Hydrocotyle perexigua is often used in water gardens and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ability to help control algae growth."
