    "intro": "Hieracium nigrescens subsp. stroemfeltii, commonly known as the Stroemfelt's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Scandinavia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. It has hairy stems and linear, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
