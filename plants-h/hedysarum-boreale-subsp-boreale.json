    "intro": "Hedysarum boreale subsp. boreale, commonly known as the alpine vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and slender, erect stems that often produce clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, contributing to soil fertility. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing slopes and providing forage for wildlife."
