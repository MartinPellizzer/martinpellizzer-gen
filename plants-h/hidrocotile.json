    "intro": "Hidrocotile, commonly known as water shield, is a floating aquatic plant native to temperate regions. It has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom above the water, typically in late spring to early summer. Hidrocotile thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some cultures."
