    "intro": "Hessea filifolia, commonly known as the threadleaf holly or coastal holly, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Hessea filifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. It plays a significant role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along the shoreline."
