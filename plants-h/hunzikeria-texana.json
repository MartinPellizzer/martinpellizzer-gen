It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Hunzikeria texana is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is known for its latex sap, which is milky and somewhat toxic. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
