    "intro": "Herpestis repens, commonly known as creeping nightshade, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant features small, hairy leaves and produces clusters of yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer. Its berries, which are toxic, are often mistaken for edible fruits due to their appearance. Despite its poisonous nature, it is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
