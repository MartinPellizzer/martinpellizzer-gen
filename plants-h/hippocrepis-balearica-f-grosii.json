    "intro": "Hippocrepis balearica f. grosii, commonly known as the Balearic scabious, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the Balearic Islands. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open habitats such as slopes and coastal areas. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
