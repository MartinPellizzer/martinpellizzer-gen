    "intro": "Hunteria pycnantha, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its dense, glabrous foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant attaches itself to host trees, primarily species of the genus *Acacia*, through its haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host. Its berries, which are orange-red in color, are an important food source for various birds and small mammals. The plant is often found in savanna and woodland habitats, where it thrives in partial shade."
