    "intro": "Heteropterys verbascifolia, commonly known as the woolly leaf tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it requires well-drained soil and partial shade."
