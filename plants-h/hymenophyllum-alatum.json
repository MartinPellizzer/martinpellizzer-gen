    "intro": "Hymenophyllum alatum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Its rhizomes are typically short and branched, allowing it to anchor to tree trunks or rocks. Hymenophyllum alatum is often found in humid rainforests and requires high levels of moisture and indirect light to flourish."
