It typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. The plant features basal and cauline leaves that are lanceolate to linear, with a hairy surface. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and it produces small, oval achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology and is often found in moist, nutrient-rich habitats."
