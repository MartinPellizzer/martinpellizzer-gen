    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracesium gneissicola, commonly known as the gneissicola hawkweed, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, preferring areas with high mineral content. Its leaves are basal, rough, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hieracium gneissicola is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
