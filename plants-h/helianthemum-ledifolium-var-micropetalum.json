    "intro": "Helianthemum ledifolium var. micropetalum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock rose, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
