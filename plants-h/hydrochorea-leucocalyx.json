    "intro": "Hydrochorea leucocalyx, commonly known as the white-flowered water bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features showy, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has slender, branching stems that often grow from water or moist soil. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Hydrochorea leucocalyx plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
