    "intro": "Hieracium subchristianiense, commonly known as the subchristianiense hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowering heads composed of numerous small florets. Native to Europe, this species is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides. It has a creeping growth habit with stolons that allow it to spread and form dense mats. The plant is generally not considered invasive and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
