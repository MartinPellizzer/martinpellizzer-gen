It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with ray florets. Hieracium cincinnulatum is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and natural settings."
