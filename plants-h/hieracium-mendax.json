    "intro": "Hieracium mendax, commonly known as the false hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the daisy family, Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a hairy texture. Hieracium mendax is often mistaken for other hawkweed species due to its similar appearance. It is considered invasive in some regions, where it can outcompete native flora."
