It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that can be pink, blue, or white, depending on soil pH. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often serrated and turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. It thrives in partial to full shade and is well-suited for trellises or as a climbing plant in gardens. Its flowers bloom in late summer and can persist through the winter in mild climates."
