It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive foliage. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces yellow flowers in late summer. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
