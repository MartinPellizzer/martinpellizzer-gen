    "intro": "Hedyotis fruticosa, commonly known as the creeping jenny, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly in moist environments. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate, with a glossy green surface. Hedyotis fruticosa thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
