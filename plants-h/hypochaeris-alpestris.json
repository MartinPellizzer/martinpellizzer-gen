    "intro": "Hypochaeris alpestris, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in early summer, and it produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hypochaeris alpestris is often found in meadows and open areas at high altitudes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
