    "intro": "Hypoporum capitatum, commonly known as the clustered goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a low, spreading growth habit with many small, clustered stems. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, achene fruits that are dispersed by wind. Hypoporum capitatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
