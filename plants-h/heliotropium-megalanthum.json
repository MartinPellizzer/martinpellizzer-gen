    "intro": "Heliotropium megalanthum, commonly known as the large-leaved heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling those of the common heliotrope. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually hairy and can grow up to 10 centimeters in length. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Heliotropium megalanthum is also noted for its ability to tolerate salt spray, making it a common species in coastal areas."
