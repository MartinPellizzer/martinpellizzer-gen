It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which are typically clustered in a flat-topped inflorescence. The plant has hairy, rough stems and leaves that are often lobed or serrated. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
