It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray leaves and clusters of small, pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in coastal areas or sandy habitats. Its flowers emit a sweet scent, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature."
