It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically a vibrant green, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, which bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established. This subspecies is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardy nature."
