    "intro": "Hypericum arboreum, commonly known as the flowering shrub or summer flowering St. John's wort, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features simple, opposite leaves that are oval and slightly hairy, and it produces small, red, bead-like fruits in the fall. Hypericum arboreum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
