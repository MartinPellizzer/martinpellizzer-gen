    "intro": "Hieracium anapsilon, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. It has a taproot system and produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
