    "intro": "Hieraciodes caulescens, commonly known as the slender rockweed, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, narrow leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
