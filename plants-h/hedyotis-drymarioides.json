    "intro": "Hedyotis drymarioides, commonly known as the coastal hedyotis, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing herb with small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers throughout the growing season. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt-laden coastal environments. Hedyotis drymarioides plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
