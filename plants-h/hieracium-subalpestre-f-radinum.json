It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers with ray florets. This plant is typically found in alpine and subalpine regions, growing in rocky or grassy habitats at high elevations. It has a low-growing habit and is often adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The f. radinum form is distinguished by its more compact growth and shorter stems compared to other forms of Hieracium subalpestre."
