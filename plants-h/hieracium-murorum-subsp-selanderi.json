    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. selanderi, commonly known as the Selander's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has small, linear to lanceolate leaves and is distinguished by its subspecific features compared to other hawkweed species. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered plant in certain regions."
