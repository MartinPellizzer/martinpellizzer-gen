    "intro": "Hypoxis limicola, commonly known as swamp star, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in South Africa. It typically grows in marshy or waterlogged soils, thriving in areas with poor drainage. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to low oxygen conditions, which is reflected in its scientific name. Hypoxis limicola plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
