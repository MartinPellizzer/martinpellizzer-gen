    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 ferdinandi, commonly known as the hybrid hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges. It produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer months, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped with serrated edges. Due to its hybrid nature, it often exhibits a range of morphological variations."
