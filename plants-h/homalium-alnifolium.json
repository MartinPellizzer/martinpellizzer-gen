    "intro": "Homalium alnifolium, commonly known as the alder-leaf euphorbia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that resemble those of alder trees, hence its common name. It produces small, clustered flowers that are often surrounded by bracts, a typical feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
