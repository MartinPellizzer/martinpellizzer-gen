It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in rocky and grassy habitats at high altitudes, where it tolerates cold and harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are lanceolate and hairy, while its yellow flowers are clustered in a flat-topped inflorescence. Hieracium ossaeum plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas and provides nectar for pollinators."
