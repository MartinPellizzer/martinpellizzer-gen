    "intro": "Himantoglossum hircinum var. pendulum, commonly known as the hanging orchid, is a rare and distinctive member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its pendulous inflorescence, which gives it its common name, and its striking, violet-blue flowers with a contrasting yellow lip. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe, this plant thrives in calcareous soils and open, sunny habitats. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
