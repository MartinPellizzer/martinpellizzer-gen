It is characterized by its upright growth habit and basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in composite heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is native to Europe and is often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf shape and flower structure."
