    "intro": "Heterotis angolensis var. bambutorum, commonly known as the African waterwheel, is a perennial aquatic plant native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves that resemble the spokes of a wheel, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. The plant is often used in water gardens and for erosion control due to its dense growth habit."
