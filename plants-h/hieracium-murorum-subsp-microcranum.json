It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, producing small, wind-dispersed seeds. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller flower heads and more compact growth form compared to other hawkweed species."
