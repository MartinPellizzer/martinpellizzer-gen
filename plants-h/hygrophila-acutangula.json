    "intro": "Hygrophila acutangula, commonly known as the spike hygrophila, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are arranged in spike-like clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Hygrophila acutangula is often used in water gardens and as a decorative plant in aquariums due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
