    "intro": "Habroneuron, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated, white or pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, which are adapted to cling to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it requires a very specific microhabitat to thrive. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Habroneuron is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
