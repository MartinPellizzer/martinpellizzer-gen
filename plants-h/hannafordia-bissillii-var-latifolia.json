    "intro": "Hannafordia bissillii var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf Hannafordia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy powder, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
