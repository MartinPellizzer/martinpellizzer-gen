    "intro": "Hieracium listrotum, commonly known as the lesser spearthistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a single head. Hieracium listrotum is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
