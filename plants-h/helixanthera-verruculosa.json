    "intro": "Helixanthera verruculosa, commonly known as the rough-horned helixanthera, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
