    "intro": "Hydrocotyle ranunculoides var. adoensis, commonly known as the Adoensian water shield, is a member of the Araliaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its floating leaves, which are typically heart-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it is often found in shallow aquatic or wetland habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in slow-moving water bodies. The species is valued for its ornamental appearance and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
