    "intro": "Hydrocotyle cymbalaria, commonly known as the water pennywort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soils, often forming dense mats on the surface of ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant features rounded, floating leaves that are usually less than 1 inch in diameter, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white and appear in clusters, and it produces small, round fruits that float on the water. Hydrocotyle cymbalaria is often considered a weed in aquatic environments due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
