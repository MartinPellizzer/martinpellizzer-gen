It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants characterized by their spadix and spathe flowers. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a smooth, waxy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
