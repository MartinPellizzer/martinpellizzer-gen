    "intro": "Hypochaeris variegata var. acutibracteata, commonly known as the acutely bracted false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features basal rosettes of spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers with a characteristic ray floret appearance. Its flowers are followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds, which aid in its spread. The species is characterized by its acute bracts and variable leaf morphology, making it distinguishable from other Hypochaeris species."
