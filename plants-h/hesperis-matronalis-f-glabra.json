    "intro": "Hesperis matronalis f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth lady's mantle, is a cultivar of the lady's mantle plant. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves that lack the typical hairy texture found in the species. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
