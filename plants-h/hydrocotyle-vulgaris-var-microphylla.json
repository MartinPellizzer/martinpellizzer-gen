    "intro": "Hydrocotyle vulgaris var. microphylla, commonly known as marsh pennywort, is a low-growing aquatic plant with heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface or lie just beneath it. It has small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. It plays a role in stabilizing water ecosystems by reducing erosion and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
