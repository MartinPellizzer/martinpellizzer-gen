    "intro": "Humboltia cassidis, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions with deep roots and waxy leaves to reduce water loss. Humboltia cassidis is often found in rocky soils and is a symbol of resilience in harsh environments."
