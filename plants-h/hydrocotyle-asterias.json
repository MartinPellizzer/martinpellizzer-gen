    "intro": "Hydrocotyle asterias, commonly known as the star-shaped water pennywort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features floating leaves that are round and often have a star-like pattern of veins, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Its small white flowers appear in clusters and bloom from late spring to early autumn. Hydrocotyle asterias plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through oxygenation."
