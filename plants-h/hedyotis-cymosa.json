    "intro": "Hedyotis cymosa, commonly known as the clustered dotweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, bright green, oval-shaped leaves arranged in a compact, bushy form. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in cymes, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Hedyotis cymosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
