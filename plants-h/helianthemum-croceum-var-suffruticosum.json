    "intro": "Helianthemum croceum var. suffruticosum, commonly known as the creeping sunrose, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a vibrant touch to rocky or sandy soils. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in full sun and is often found in coastal areas or dry grasslands. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover in xeriscaped landscapes."
