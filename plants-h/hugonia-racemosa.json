    "intro": "Hugonia racemosa, commonly known as the creeping marshplant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats in moist soils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters along the stems, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often have a slight sheen, adapting to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions. Hugonia racemosa plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic insects."
