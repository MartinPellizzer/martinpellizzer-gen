    "intro": "Henonia deserti, commonly known as the desert helenium, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant typically grows from 10 to 30 centimeters in height, with narrow, gray-green leaves adapted to conserve water. Its bright yellow to orange flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Henonia deserti is well-suited to harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats."
