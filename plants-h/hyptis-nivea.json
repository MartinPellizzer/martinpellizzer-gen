It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and thrives in well-drained soils. Its aromatic leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Hyptis nivea is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
