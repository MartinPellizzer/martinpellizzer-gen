    "intro": "Hirtella tenuifolia, commonly known as the silky hirtella, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Hirtella tenuifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
