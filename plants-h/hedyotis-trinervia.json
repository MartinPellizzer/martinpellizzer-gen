    "intro": "Hedyotis trinervia, commonly known as the three-veined bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia and Africa. It typically features small, opposite leaves with three prominent veins, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring or early summer. Hedyotis trinervia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its delicate structure and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for garden cultivation in suitable climates."
