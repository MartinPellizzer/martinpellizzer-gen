    "intro": "Hyptis sericea, commonly known as silverleaf hyptis, is a herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from the dense covering of fine hairs on its leaves. It produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or violet, arranged in spikes at the ends of the stems. Hyptis sericea is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal."
