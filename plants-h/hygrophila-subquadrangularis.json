    "intro": "Hygrophila subquadrangularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water hyssop, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its square stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, arranged in whorled clusters. It thrives in moist or aquatic environments, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its ornamental value and ability to purify water, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and wetland restoration projects."
