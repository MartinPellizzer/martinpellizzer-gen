    "intro": "Herya anomala, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers during the summer months. Its bark exudes a milky sap, which is toxic and has been used traditionally for various purposes. Herya anomala is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
