    "intro": "Helichrysum foetidum, commonly known as the stinking everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, yellow or orange-yellow flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically clustered in a rounded shape. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Despite its common name, it is prized for its ornamental value and ability to retain its color when dried."
