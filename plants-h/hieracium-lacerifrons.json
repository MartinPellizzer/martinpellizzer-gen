    "intro": "Hieracium lacerifrons, commonly known as the roughleaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in grassy areas and open woodlands. The plant has basal and stem leaves that are rough and hairy, with a serrated or lobed edge. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and it produces small, oval seeds in its fruiting stage. Hieracium lacerifrons is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils."
