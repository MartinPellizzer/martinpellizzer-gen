    "intro": "Humularia descampsii var. abercornensis, commonly known as the Abercorn hawthorn, is a rare shrub native to the coastal regions of southern England. It is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red berries in the autumn. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or coastal scrub habitats. It has small, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated edge. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
