    "intro": "Hedyotis salina, commonly known as saltbush or coastal hedyotis, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous shrub that typically grows in saline and sandy soils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are often borne on slender stems. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Hedyotis salina is adapted to withstand high salinity and is often found in dune environments along the coast."
