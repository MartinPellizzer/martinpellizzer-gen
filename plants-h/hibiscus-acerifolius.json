    "intro": "Hibiscus acerifolius, commonly known as the maple-leaf hibiscus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its palmate leaves that resemble maple leaves, which are usually green with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink or red, often with a prominent yellow or orange center. These flowers bloom in summer and are followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Hibiscus acerifolius is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soil and full sun."
