    "intro": "Heliotropium pseudostrigosum, commonly known as the woolly heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open fields. Heliotropium pseudostrigosum is adapted to full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
