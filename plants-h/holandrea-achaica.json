    "intro": "Holandrea achaica, commonly known as the Achaic holandrea, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage, which forms a central cup to collect moisture from the humid environment. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale yellow. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
