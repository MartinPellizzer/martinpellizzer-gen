    "intro": "Hypoporum diffusum, commonly known as the spreading hypoporum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and arranged in loose clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer. Hypoporum diffusum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
