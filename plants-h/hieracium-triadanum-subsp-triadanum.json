    "intro": "Hieracium triadanum subsp. triadanum, commonly known as the Triadan hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosettes of leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in composite flower heads, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and often endangered species in many regions."
