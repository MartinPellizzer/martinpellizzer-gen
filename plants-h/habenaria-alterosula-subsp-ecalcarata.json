It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. This subspecies is characterized by its distinctive, narrowly elliptical leaves and is valued for its ecological and ornamental significance."
