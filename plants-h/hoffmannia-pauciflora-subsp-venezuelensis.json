    "intro": "Hoffmannia pauciflora subsp. venezuelensis, commonly known as the Venezuelan Hoffmannia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Venezuela. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the dry season. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
