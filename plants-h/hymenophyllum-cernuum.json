    "intro": "Hymenophyllum cernuum, commonly known as the hanging fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that often hang downward, giving it its common name. The plant has a very thin, translucent appearance with a dense covering of rhizomes and tiny, scale-like leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Hymenophyllum cernuum is known for its intricate structure and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
