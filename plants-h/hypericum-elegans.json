    "intro": "Hypericum elegans, commonly known as the elegant St. John's wort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, evergreen leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, red-orange fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Hypericum elegans thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
