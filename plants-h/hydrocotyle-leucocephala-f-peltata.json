    "intro": "Hydrocotyle leucocephala f. peltata, commonly known as the broadleaf marsh mallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soil. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle ornamental value to its habitat. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems. The leaves are often coated with a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss in its wetland environment."
