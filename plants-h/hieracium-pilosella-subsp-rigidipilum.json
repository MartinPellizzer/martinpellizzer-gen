    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. rigidipilum, commonly known as the rigid-hair hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves with stiff, hairy surfaces. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Compositae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
