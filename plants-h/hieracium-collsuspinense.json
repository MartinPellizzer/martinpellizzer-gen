    "intro": "Hieracium collsuspinense, commonly known as the spiked hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its flowers are yellow and bloom from late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is known for its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its often sunny habitats."
