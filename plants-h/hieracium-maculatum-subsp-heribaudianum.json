    "intro": "Hieracium maculatum subsp. heribaudianum, commonly known as the Heribaud's Hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, heart-shaped leaves and produces numerous yellow flowers in clustered heads. The plant is native to Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has finely hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly larger flower heads and more pronounced leaf markings compared to other members of the species."
