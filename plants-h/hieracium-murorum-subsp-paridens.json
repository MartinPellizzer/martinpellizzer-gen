    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. paridens, commonly known as the mouse-ear hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread vegetatively. Due to its aggressive growth, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
