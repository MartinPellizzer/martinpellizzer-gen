    "intro": "Heliophila leptophylla, commonly known as the slender-leaved heliophyte, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Heliophila leptophylla thrives in shallow water or damp soil, often forming dense colonies in wet meadows and riverbanks. Its delicate structure and aquatic habitat make it an important species for wetland ecosystems."
