    "intro": "Hieracium leptadeniiforme, commonly known as the slender-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often in temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and its flowers are yellow with ray florets. It is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
