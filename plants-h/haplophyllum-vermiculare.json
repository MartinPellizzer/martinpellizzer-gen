    "intro": "Haplophyllum vermiculare, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water. The plant typically has small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Haplophyllum vermiculare is often found in disturbed areas and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
