It features basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers with ray florets. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, alkaline environments. It is often found in open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
