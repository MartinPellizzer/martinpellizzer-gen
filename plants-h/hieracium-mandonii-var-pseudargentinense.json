    "intro": "Hieracium mandonii var. pseudargentinense, commonly known as the Argentine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in grasslands and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 50 cm. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a cluster. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
