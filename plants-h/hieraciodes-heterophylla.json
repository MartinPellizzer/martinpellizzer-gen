    "intro": "Hieraciodes heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf hieraciodes, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant exhibits a range of morphological variations, particularly in leaf shape, which is reflected in its scientific name \"heterophylla,\" meaning \"different leaves.\" It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
