    "intro": "Hieracium purpureum, commonly known as the purple hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically purple or pink, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and they bloom from late spring to early autumn. Hieracium purpureum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
