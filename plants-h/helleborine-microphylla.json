It is characterized by its dark green, narrow leaves that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant produces pale green to yellowish flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip, which are usually borne on slender stalks. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Helleborine microphylla is notable for its ability to hybridize with other helleborine species, contributing to its genetic diversity."
