    "intro": "Heleochloa brachystachys, commonly known as the dwarf hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to wetland and marshy areas in Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in height, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wet meadows and along the edges of ponds. Due to its compact size and ability to stabilize soil, it plays a role in ecological restoration projects."
