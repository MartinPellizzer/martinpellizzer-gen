It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants such as mint and basil. The plant is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, and its small, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters.

Hyptis diaphora is also used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
