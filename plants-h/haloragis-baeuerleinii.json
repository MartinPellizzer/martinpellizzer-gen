    "intro": "Haloragis baeuerleinii, commonly known as the coastal wallaby's tail, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Haloragis baeuerleinii is adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden environments, making it a hardy species found in coastal dunes and rocky shores."
