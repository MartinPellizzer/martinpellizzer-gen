    "intro": "Huilaea penduliflora, commonly known as the hanging flower or pendulous flower, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that hang from slender stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests or high-altitude meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reflect excess light. Huilaea penduliflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
