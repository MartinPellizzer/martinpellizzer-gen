    "intro": "Hieracium froederstroemii, commonly known as Froederstr\u00f8m's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Scandinavia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. It has finely divided, grass-like leaves and produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
