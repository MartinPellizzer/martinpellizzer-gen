    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracussion subprealtum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cooler, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
