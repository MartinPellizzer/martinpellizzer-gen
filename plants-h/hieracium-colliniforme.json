    "intro": "Hieracium colliniforme, commonly known as the hill dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a hairy stem that supports a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, elongated stem that becomes covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky soils, and is often found in disturbed areas. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
