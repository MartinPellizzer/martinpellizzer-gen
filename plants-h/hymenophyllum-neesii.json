    "intro": "Hymenophyllum neesii, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its soft, velvety fronds that are covered in dense, appressed hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a delicate, almost translucent texture. Hymenophyllum neesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
