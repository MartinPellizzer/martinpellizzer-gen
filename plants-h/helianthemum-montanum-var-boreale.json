It is a low-growing shrub with fleshy, gray-green leaves that are adapted to cold and arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
