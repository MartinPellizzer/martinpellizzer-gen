    "intro": "Hieracium nylanderianum, commonly known as the Nylander's hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, and it produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it has a fibrous root system. Nylander's hawkweed is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
