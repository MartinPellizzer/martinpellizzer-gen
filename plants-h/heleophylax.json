    "intro": "Heleophylax, commonly known as the sun orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their bright, showy flowers that often feature vivid colors such as yellow, orange, and red. Heleophylax species are typically found in sunny, open habitats, including grasslands and rocky areas. They have specialized root systems that allow them to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, particularly bees and butterflies, which are attracted by their nectar-rich structures."
