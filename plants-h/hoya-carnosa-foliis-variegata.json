    "intro": "Hoya carnosa foliis-variegata, commonly known as the variegated wax plant, is a tropical species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, ovate leaves that display a striking variegation of cream, white, and green. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom at the ends of its stems. It is a popular houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its air-purifying properties. The leaves are also known for their ability to store water, making the plant drought-tolerant."
