    "intro": "Hymenophyllum abruptum, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often folded or curled, giving it a unique appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its spores are released from tiny, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the leaves. Hymenophyllum abruptum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, indoor settings."
