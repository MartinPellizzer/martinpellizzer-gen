    "intro": "Hoya undulata, commonly known as the wavy hoya, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a wavy or undulating edge. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late winter or early spring. Hoya undulata is a popular houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low light conditions and its relatively easy care requirements. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and air-purifying qualities."
