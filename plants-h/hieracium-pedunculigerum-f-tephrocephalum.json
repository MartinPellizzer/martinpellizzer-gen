    "intro": "Hieracium pedunculigerum f. tephrocephalum, commonly known as the tephrocephalous hawkweed, is a botanical variant of the hawkweed genus. It is characterized by its distinctive, woolly, and often pale-colored flower heads, which are typically clustered in a dense inflorescence. The plant is a perennial herb with a rosette of basal leaves and stems that bear the flowering heads. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats. Its morphology reflects adaptations to its environment, with features that aid in wind pollination and seed dispersal."
