    "intro": "Hieracium kaldalonense, commonly known as the Kaldalon hairy hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Kaldalon Mountains. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky and grassy habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are rough and hairy, with a distinct basal rosette structure, and it produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
