It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in the dense undergrowth of tropical forests. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered vulnerable and requires protection to ensure its survival."
