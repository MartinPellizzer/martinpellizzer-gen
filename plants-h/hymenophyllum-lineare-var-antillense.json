    "intro": "Hymenophyllum lineare var. antillense, commonly known as the Antillean fern, is a small, delicate moss-like fern native to the Caribbean region. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, hair-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are covered with a dense layer of rhizoids, which help anchor it to substrates and absorb moisture. This variety is distinguished by its slightly elongated leaf shape compared to the typical Hymenophyllum lineare."
