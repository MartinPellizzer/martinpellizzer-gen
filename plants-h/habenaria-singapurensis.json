    "intro": "Habenaria singapurensis, commonly known as the Singapore orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including Singapore. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming during the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
