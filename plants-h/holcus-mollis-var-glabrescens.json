It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, soft foliage that gives it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its ecological value includes providing habitat and food for various insect species."
