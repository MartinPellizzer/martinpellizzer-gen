    "intro": "Hieracium argyraeum, commonly known as silver hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its silver-white, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural landscapes."
