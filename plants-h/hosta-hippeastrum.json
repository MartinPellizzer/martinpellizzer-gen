    "intro": "Hosta hippeastrum, commonly known as the dragon blood plant, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its striking, dark red to purple sap, which is highly toxic and has historically been used in traditional medicine. The plant features broad, waxy leaves that are typically dark green in color, and it produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Hosta hippeastrum thrives in warm, sunny conditions and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets."
