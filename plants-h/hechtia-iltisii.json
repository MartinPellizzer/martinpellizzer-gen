    "intro": "Hechtia iltisii, commonly known as the Iltis hechtia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to Mexico, specifically the state of Oaxaca, where it grows in rocky and sunny habitats. The plant is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. It produces striking orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, Hechtia iltisii is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecosystem."
