    "intro": "Hieris, commonly known as the common sandthorn, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight waxy coating. Hieris is typically found in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to coastal and inland environments."
