    "intro": "Hedyosmos stachyoides, commonly known as the Indian madder, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with opposite, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by capsule fruits containing elliptical seeds. It is known for its historical use in dyeing textiles due to the presence of anthraquinone pigments in its roots. Hedyosmos stachyoides thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth."
