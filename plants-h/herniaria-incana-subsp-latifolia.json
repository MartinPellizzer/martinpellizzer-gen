    "intro": "Herniaria incana subsp. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and coastal regions of Europe. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or rocky habitats. Its compact growth habit and ability to stabilize sand make it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
