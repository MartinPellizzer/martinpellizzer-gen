    "intro": "Holcus aciculatus, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which contains small, pale green flowers. Holcus aciculatus is generally low-growing and plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
