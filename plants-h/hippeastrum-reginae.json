    "intro": "Hippeastrum reginae, commonly known as the Queen's night lily, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant produces a bulbous underground stem that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive periods of dormancy. Its foliage consists of strap-like leaves that emerge after flowering, and it thrives in well-drained soil with moderate sunlight. Hippeastrum reginae is popular as a houseplant due to its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
