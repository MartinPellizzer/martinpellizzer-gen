    "intro": "Helodium inundatum, commonly known as the water helodium, is a perennial aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, aiding in photosynthesis. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often greenish-white in color, and appear in clusters. Helodium inundatum plays a role in stabilizing water ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
