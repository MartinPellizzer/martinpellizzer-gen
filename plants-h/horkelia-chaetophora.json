    "intro": "Horkelia chaetophora, commonly known as the hairy horkelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Horkelia chaetophora is often found in mountainous regions and is adapted to thrive in full sun conditions."
