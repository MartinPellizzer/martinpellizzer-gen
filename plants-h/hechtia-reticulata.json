    "intro": "Hechtia reticulata, commonly known as the netted hechtia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, waxy leaves that form a water-holding cup. The leaves are typically blue-green in color with a distinctive net-like pattern of veins, giving it its common name. It produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, emerging from the center of the rosette. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to humid, shady environments."
