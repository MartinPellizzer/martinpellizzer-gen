It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in response to sunlight. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
