    "intro": "Heracleum pubescens, commonly known as rough cowparsley, is a member of the carrot family (Apiaceae). It is a biennial herb that typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant features a tall, hollow stem covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are deeply divided with a rough texture. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-like clusters, which are followed by small, dry fruits. This species is often found in Europe and parts of Asia, and it can be mistaken for other toxic look-alikes, so caution is advised when handling it."
