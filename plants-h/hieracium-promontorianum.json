    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracussion promontorianum, commonly known as the promontory hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and parts of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along coastal cliffs and dunes, where it thrives in salty and windy conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
