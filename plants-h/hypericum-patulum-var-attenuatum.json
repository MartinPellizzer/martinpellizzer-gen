    "intro": "Hypericum patulum var. attenuatum, commonly known as the slender St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features wiry, ascending stems that often lie prostrate, with small, oval-shaped leaves that are slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. Its medicinal properties are similar to other Hypericum species, though it is less commonly used in traditional herbal medicine. The varietal form, attenuatum, is distinguished by its more elongated and attenuated growth habit compared to the typical form."
