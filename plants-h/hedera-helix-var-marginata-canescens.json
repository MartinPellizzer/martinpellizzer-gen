    "intro": "Hedera helix var. marginata-canescens, commonly known as the silver-leaf ivy, is a variant of the common ivy characterized by its distinctive silvery-white margins on the leaves. This plant is a climbing evergreen vine native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found growing on walls, trees, and rocky surfaces. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a textured, slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments and is often used in ornamental landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to cover vertical spaces."
