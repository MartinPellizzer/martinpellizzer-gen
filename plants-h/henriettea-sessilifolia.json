    "intro": "Henriettea sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf henriettea, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Violaceae, which includes violets and related species. The plant is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or violet. Its leaves are sessile, meaning they lack stalks and are directly attached to the stem. Henriettea sessilifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
