It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands. The plant features a slender rhizome and produces erect, branched inflorescences with small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are broad and ovate, often with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
