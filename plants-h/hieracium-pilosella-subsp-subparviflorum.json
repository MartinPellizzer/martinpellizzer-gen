It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowering stems bear small, yellow, daisy-like flowers. It produces numerous seeds enclosed in a hollow, cylindrical achene, which is characteristic of the Asteraceae family. Due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in various conditions, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
