It is characterized by its hairy, often glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces large, showy flowers with five petals, typically in shades of pink, red, or white. Hibiscus squarrulosus thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its flowers are not only visually striking but also attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
