    "intro": "Halimium lasianthum subsp. alyssoides, commonly known as the alpine catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is a low-growing perennial herb with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers with four petals, which are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
