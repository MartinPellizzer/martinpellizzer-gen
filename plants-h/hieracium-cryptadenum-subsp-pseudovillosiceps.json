    "intro": "Hieracium cryptadenum subsp. pseudovillosiceps, commonly known as the woolly-haired hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lanceolate leaves and produces yellow flowers in the summer months. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense, woolly pubescence on the stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant species."
