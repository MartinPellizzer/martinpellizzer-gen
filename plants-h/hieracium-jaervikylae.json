    "intro": "Hieracium jaervikylae, commonly known as the Jaerviky Lake Hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the wetland areas of Estonia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found near water bodies. Its yellow flowers bloom in late summer, and it has hairy, linear leaves that help it retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
