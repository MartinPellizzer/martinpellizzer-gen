    "intro": "Hieracium brachycomum subsp. laevifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are generally smooth and leathery in texture. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its growth habit and foliage make it a distinctive member of the hawkweed complex."
