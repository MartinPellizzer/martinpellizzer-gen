    "intro": "Hieracium caligans, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
