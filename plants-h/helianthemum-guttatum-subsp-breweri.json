    "intro": "Helianthemum guttatum subsp. breweri, commonly known as the Brewer's sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it well adapted to its native habitat. The subspecies is distinguished by its glandular leaves and specific floral morphology compared to other members of the genus."
