    "intro": "Hieracium praecellans, commonly known as the noble hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its bright yellow flowers appear in late spring to early summer, and the plant can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Hieracium praecellans is known for its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry conditions."
