It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring moist to moderately dry conditions. It features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy, with a flowering period from late spring to early autumn. The showy yellow flowers are followed by seed heads that are easily dispersed by wind."
