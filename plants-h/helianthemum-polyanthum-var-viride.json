It features small, upright stems covered in dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to full sun. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in Mediterranean climates."
