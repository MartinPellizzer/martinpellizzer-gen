    "intro": "Hirculus propinquus, commonly known as the close relative of the goat, is a plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and hairy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by spherical, red berries that are edible for both humans and wildlife. Hirculus propinquus is adapted to cold climates and has a slow growth rate, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various animals."
