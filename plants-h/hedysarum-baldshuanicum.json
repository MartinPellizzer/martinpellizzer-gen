It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically borne on the upper part of the stems. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Hedysarum baldshuanicum is often found in steppe and desert regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
