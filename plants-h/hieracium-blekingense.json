    "intro": "Hieracium blekingense, commonly known as Blekinge hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to northern Europe. It belongs to the dandelion family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and along riverbanks. It has hairy stems and leaves with a serrated edge, and it produces numerous small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
