    "intro": "Hevea guianensis var. occidentalis, commonly known as the Western Guianese rubber tree, is a species native to South America, particularly found in regions of Guyana and Suriname. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and large, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant is notable for its latex-producing properties, which can be tapped for natural rubber, though it is less commercially significant than other hevea species. Its ecological role includes providing habitat for various wildlife species and contributing to the biodiversity of tropical rainforests."
