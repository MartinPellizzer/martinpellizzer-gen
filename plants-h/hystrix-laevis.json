It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems that are covered in small, smooth spines. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its water-storing stems. Its flowers, which are often yellow or orange, bloom during the warmer months. Hystrix laevis is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry climates."
