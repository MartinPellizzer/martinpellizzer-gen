    "intro": "Hydrocotyle bonplandii var. hirtipes, commonly known as the hairy water penny, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the wetlands of South America. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hairy textures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Its adaptability to wet conditions makes it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
