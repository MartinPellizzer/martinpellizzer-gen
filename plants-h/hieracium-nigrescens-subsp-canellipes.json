    "intro": "Hieracium nigrescens subsp. canellipes, commonly known as the black-veined hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 50 cm. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, while the upper leaves are more narrow. Its flowers are yellow, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and are surrounded by bracts. The subspecies is distinguished by its dark, almost black veins on the leaves, which give it its common name."
