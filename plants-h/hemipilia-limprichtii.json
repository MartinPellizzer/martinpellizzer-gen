    "intro": "Hemipilia limprichtii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hemipilia, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
