    "intro": "Hordeum pratense, commonly known as meadow barley, is a grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and loose, spike-like inflorescence composed of small, two-rowed spikelets. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, while its seeds are small and enclosed in protective glumes. Hordeum pratense is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and as a forage crop for livestock."
