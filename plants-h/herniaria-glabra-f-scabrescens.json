    "intro": "Herniaria glabra f. scabrescens, commonly known as the rough bladderwort, is a low-growing succulent plant characterized by its fleshy, pale green leaves that are covered in a fine, scaly texture. It belongs to the family Cariophyllaceae and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it well adapted to dry environments. The subspecies scabrescens is distinguished by its rough, scaly leaves compared to the smooth-leaved typical form of Herniaria glabra."
