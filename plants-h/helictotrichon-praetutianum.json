    "intro": "Helictotrichon praetutianum, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine zones. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
