It is a perennial shrub characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. Humboltia rostriflora is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral ecosystems, where it contributes to the local biodiversity. Its unique floral structure and fragrance make it an important species for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
