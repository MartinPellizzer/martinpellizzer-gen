    "intro": "Hieracium sabaudum var. villosum, commonly known as the soft hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosettes of broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a weed in agricultural areas and natural habitats."
