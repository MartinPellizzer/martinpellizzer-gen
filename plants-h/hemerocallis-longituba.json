    "intro": "Hemerocallis longituba, commonly known as the Chinese daylily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features sword-shaped, lanceolate leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late summer. It is known for its strong, sometimes unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Hemerocallis longituba is relatively hardy and adaptable, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
