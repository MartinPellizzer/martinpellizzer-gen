    "intro": "Herminium angustilabre, commonly known as the narrow-lipped orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
