    "intro": "Habenaria rodriguesii, commonly known as Rodrigues's orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure and specialized growth habits. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its flowers are usually small and delicate, with a distinct coloration that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a conservation concern."
