    "intro": "Heteranthera limosa subsp. rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf water hyssop, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate to round leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant has two types of stamens, a characteristic feature of the genus Heteranthera, with some stamens being longer than others. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil and is often found in marshes and pond edges. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for wetland gardens and water feature plantings."
