    "intro": "Hordeum lechleri, commonly known as *Dragon's Blood Tree*, is a rare and unique plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-shaped crown and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid environment. The plant produces a dark red, resinous sap that has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and as a natural dye. Its botanical significance lies in its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in the ecological balance of the rainforest. However, it is critically endangered due to habitat loss and overharvesting of its valuable sap."
