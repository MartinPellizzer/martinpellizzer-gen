    "intro": "Hakea megadenia, commonly known as the broad-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems and thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikes of bright yellow flowers, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Hakea megadenia is adapted to arid environments, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
