    "intro": "Hypoestes floribunda var. paniculata, commonly known as the flame violet, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often with contrasting purple or white markings. The plant produces clusters of small, showy blooms on slender stems, which are particularly noticeable during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
