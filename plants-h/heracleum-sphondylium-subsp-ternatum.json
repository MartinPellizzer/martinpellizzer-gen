    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium subsp. ternatum, commonly known as the common cow parsnip, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, umbrella-like compound leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. Its roots are tuberous and can be edible when properly prepared, though the plant contains phototoxic compounds that can cause skin irritation. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in meadows."
