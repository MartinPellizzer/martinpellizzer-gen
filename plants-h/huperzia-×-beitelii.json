    "intro": "Huperzia \u00d7 beitelii, commonly known as the hybrid spikemoss, is a fern ally belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Huperzia selago and Huperzia squamata. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its sporophytic structures are characterized by a rosette of spore-bearing leaves. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with elongated, spiky leaves that distinguish it from other spikemoss species."
