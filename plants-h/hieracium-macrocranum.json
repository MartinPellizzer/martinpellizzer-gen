    "intro": "Hieracium macrocranum, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typical daisy-like appearance. The plant features upright stems covered in rough, hairy foliage, and its large, showy yellow flowers bloom in late summer. Hieracium macrocranum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
