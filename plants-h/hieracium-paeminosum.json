    "intro": "Hieracium paeminosum, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe, it thrives in meadows and grassy areas, often forming dense colonies. The plant has a taproot system and produces seeds in a composite flower head. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
