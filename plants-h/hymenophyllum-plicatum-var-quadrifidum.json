    "intro": "Hymenophyllum plicatum var. quadrifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hymenophyllum, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. Its small, clustered growth habit and intricate leaf structure make it a distinctive and ornamental plant. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are typically covered in a membranous layer known as the hymenium."
