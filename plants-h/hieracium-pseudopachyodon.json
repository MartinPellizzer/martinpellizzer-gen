    "intro": "Hieracium pseudopachyodon, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. It is an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native plants due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production."
