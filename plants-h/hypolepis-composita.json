    "intro": "Hypolepis composita, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into shield-like segments, giving it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and colonize new areas. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal. Hypolepis composita thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
