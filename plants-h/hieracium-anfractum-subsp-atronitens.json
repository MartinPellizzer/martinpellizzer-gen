It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal leaves that are typically lance-shaped and have a rough texture. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, with petals that are narrow and pointed. Its leaves and stems are covered in fine, glandular hairs, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. This subspecies is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in alpine and subalpine habitats."
