It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or white in color. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often used in ornamental landscaping for its trailing habit."
