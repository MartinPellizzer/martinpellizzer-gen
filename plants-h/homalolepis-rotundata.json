    "intro": "Homalolepis rotundata, commonly known as the round-leafed fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, clump-forming growth habit and its dark green, leathery fronds. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sorus on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Homalolepis rotundata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
