    "intro": "Henckelia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf henckelia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the humid forests of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 30 centimeters, with glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. Its flowers are small, white, and fragrant, often appearing in clusters, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Henckelia pumila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
