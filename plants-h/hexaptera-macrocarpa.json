    "intro": "Hexaptera macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited hexaptera, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant produces large, woody capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically palmately lobed, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats. Hexaptera macrocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential ecological roles in its native ecosystems."
