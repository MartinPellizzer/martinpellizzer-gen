    "intro": "Hydrangea frutescens, commonly known as the smooth hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that can range in color from white to pink, red, or blue depending on soil pH. The plant produces small, white flowers that develop into cylindrical, dry fruits called follicles. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a smooth margin and a glossy upper surface. Hydrangea frutescens thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
