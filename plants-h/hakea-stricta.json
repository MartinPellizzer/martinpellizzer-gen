    "intro": "Hakea stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. Hakea stricta is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to thrive in dry conditions. It is often used in native gardens for its hardiness and ornamental value."
