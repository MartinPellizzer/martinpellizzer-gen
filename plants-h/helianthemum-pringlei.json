    "intro": "Helianthemum pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of southern California and Baja California. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has silver-gray, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It is well adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun. Helianthemum pringlei is often found in coastal sage scrub and chaparral ecosystems."
