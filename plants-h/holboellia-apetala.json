    "intro": "Holboellia apetala, commonly known as the leafy liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its simple, lobed leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and flowers, and instead relies on rhizoids for anchoring and nutrient absorption. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Holboellia apetala plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms."
