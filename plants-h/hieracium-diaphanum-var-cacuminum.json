    "intro": "Hieracium diaphanum var. cacuminum, commonly known as the translucent hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Native to Europe, this variant is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. The plant's translucent, waxy coating on its leaves is a distinguishing feature that aids in reducing water loss. It is typically perennial and grows to a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters."
