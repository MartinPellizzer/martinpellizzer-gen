    "intro": "Hydrocotyle gracilis, commonly known as slender water pennywort, is a semi-aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in ponds, streams, and marshes. The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves that are usually floating or just partially submerged. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and it produces tiny, dark seeds. Hydrocotyle gracilis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
