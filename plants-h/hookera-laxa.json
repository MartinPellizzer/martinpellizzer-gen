It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to the cold, harsh conditions of its habitat. Hookera laxa has hairy leaves and stems, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It is a perennial herb that blooms in the summer months."
