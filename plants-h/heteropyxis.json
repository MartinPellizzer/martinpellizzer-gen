    "intro": "Heteropyxis, commonly known as the African snowball, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhamnaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in sub-Saharan Africa, characterized by their shrub-like growth habit. The plants typically have small, opposite leaves and produce clusters of white or pale pink flowers that resemble snowballs, hence their common name. Heteropyxis species are often found in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid climates. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their unique floral display."
