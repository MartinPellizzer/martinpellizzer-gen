It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with pale or brownish flowers. It thrives in maritime climates and is often found along shorelines and dunes. Its hairy leaves and salt tolerance make it a resilient species in harsh coastal conditions."
