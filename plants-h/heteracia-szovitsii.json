    "intro": "Heteracia szovitsii, commonly known as the Szovits' lily, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Hungary. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. Its botanical features include strap-like leaves and a short, erect stem that supports its showy inflorescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
