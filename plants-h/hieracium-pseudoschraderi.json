    "intro": "Hieracium pseudoschraderi, commonly known as the Schrader's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are hairy and lance-shaped, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
