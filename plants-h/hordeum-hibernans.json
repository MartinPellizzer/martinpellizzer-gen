    "intro": "Hordeum hibernans, commonly known as winter barley, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its robust, tufted growth habit and its ability to survive harsh winter conditions. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and tough, with a bluish-green hue, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in poor soils. Hordeum hibernans is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and as a food source for wildlife."
