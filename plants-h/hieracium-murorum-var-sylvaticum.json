    "intro": "Hieracium murorum var. sylvaticum, commonly known as the woodland hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and bright yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It has a taproot system and produces seeds in small, brown, oval-shaped capsules. This variant is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more open growth habit compared to other Hieracium species."
