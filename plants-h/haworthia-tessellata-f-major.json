    "intro": "Haworthia tessellata f. major, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to South Africa. It features striking, zebra-like markings on its fleshy, blue-green leaves, which are covered in fine, white tubercles. The plant thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. It produces small, white flowers on tall stems during the warmer months. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor and rock garden settings."
