    "intro": "Hierochloe gunckelii, commonly known as the alpine hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or alpine soils. This plant thrives in cold, moist environments and is typically found in mountainous areas with limited soil cover. Its low-growing structure helps it withstand harsh weather conditions, including strong winds and freezing temperatures. Hierochloe gunckelii plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
