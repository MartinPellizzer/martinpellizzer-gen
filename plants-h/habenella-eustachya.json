    "intro": "Habenella eustachya, commonly known as the tall grass or false panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
