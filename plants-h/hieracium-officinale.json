    "intro": "Hieracium officinale, commonly known as common hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can form dense colonies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are arranged in a composite head. Hieracium officinale is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
