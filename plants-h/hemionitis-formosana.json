    "intro": "Hemionitis formosana, commonly known as the Taiwan spleenwort, is a rare and endangered fern native to Taiwan. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in montane forests. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of its leaves. Due to habitat destruction, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
