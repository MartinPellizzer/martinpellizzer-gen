    "intro": "Helichrysum allioides, commonly known as the garlic chrysanthemum, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellow-orange flowers that resemble tiny chrysanthemums, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. The plant produces a strong, garlic-like scent, which is particularly noticeable when the leaves are crushed. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Helichrysum allioides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in floral arrangements."
