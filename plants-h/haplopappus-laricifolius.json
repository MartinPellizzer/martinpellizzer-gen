    "intro": "Haplopappus laricifolius, commonly known as the mountain pappus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats at high elevations. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a silvery or grayish underside, which helps reduce water loss. The small, yellow flowers appear in clusters and are followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds."
