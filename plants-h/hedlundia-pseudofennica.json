It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in boreal and subarctic habitats. It has small, lanceolate leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
