    "intro": "Hieracium djimilense subsp. obscuricaule, commonly known as the dark-stemmed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Africa. It typically grows in open grasslands and rocky soils, thriving in temperate to subtropical climates. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in a single, terminal head. Its flowering period occurs during the warmer months, usually from spring to early autumn. The subspecies is characterized by its shorter, more compact stature and darker, more robust stems compared to other members of the Hieracium genus."
