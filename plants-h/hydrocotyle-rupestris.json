    "intro": "Hydrocotyle rupestris, commonly known as the rock nettle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers throughout the growing season. Its fibrous roots are adapted to anchor it in loose, rocky soils. Hydrocotyle rupestris is often found in coastal areas and dry slopes, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions."
