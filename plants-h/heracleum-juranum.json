It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils across Central and Eastern Europe. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbrella-like clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Heracleum juranum is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges."
