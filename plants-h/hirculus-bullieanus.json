    "intro": "Hirculus bullieanus, commonly known as the moonlit orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It features delicate, pale violet petals with a subtle iridescence that shimmers under moonlight, giving it its common name. The plant has a compact, upright growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery\u7ed2\u6bdb. Its flowers bloom only during the lunar cycle, typically at night, and are pollinated by nocturnal moths. Due to its unique appearance and ecological niche, Hirculus bullieanus is considered a conservation priority."
