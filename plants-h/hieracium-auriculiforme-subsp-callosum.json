    "intro": "Hieracium auriculiforme subsp. callosum, commonly known as the broadleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges. This subspecies is notable for its aggressive growth and ability to form dense mats, making it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings."
