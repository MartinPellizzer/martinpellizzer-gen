    "intro": "Hieracium lawsonii subsp. flocciramum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a basal rosette of soft, woolly, and often silver-gray leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow with a central disk, and it produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This subspecies is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows."
