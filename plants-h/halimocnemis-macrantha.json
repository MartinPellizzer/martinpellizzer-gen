    "intro": "Halimocnemis macrantha, commonly known as the large-fruited sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with small, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Halimocnemis macrantha is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops."
