    "intro": "Hieracium bjeluschae, commonly known as the Bjeluszczak's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are usually basal, with a rough texture, and its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
