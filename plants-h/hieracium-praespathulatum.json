    "intro": "Hieracium praespathulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring temperate climates. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are narrow and often hairy. Hieracium praespathulatum is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
