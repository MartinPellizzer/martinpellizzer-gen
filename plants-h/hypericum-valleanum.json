    "intro": "Hypericum valleanum, commonly known as the Valleanum St. John's Wort, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its medicinal properties are attributed to the presence of hypericin and pseudohypericin, compounds with potential antidepressant effects. However, it is important to note that the plant contains phototoxic compounds, so it should be used with caution."
