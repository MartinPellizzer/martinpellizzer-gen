    "intro": "Hieracium foliosissimum, commonly known as the leafy hawkweed, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its often wet environment. It is considered a minor weed in agricultural settings but plays a role in supporting pollinators."
