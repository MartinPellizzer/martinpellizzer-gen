    "intro": "Helichrysum laxum, commonly known as the woolly helichrysum, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its fluffy, yellow to orange flower heads that resemble small spheres. The plant has narrow, silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The flowers are not only ornamental but also attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
