    "intro": "Hieracium calodon subsp. multiceps, commonly known as the many-headed hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering stem that bears multiple, small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, and the flowers are pollinated primarily by insects. It is considered a weedy species due to its ability to spread rapidly and establish in various habitats."
