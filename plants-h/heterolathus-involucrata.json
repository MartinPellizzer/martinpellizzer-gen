    "intro": "Heterolathus involucrata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many areas."
