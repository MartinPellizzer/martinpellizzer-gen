It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf arrangements and often edible species. The plant features small, delicate leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, with thin, hair-like structures along the leaf margins. It produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and wetland restoration projects."
