    "intro": "Hydrangea macrophylla f. yesoensis, commonly known as the Yesso hydrangea, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to Japan. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that can range from blue to pink, depending on soil pH. The plant produces sterile flowers, which are often the primary ornamental feature. It thrives in partial shade and requires moist, well-drained soil. This variety is prized for its hardiness and ability to bloom reliably in cooler climates."
