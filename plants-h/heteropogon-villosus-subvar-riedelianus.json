    "intro": "Heteropogon villosus subvar. riedelianus, commonly known as the Riedel's hairy grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, cylindrical stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-gray hue due to the dense pubescence. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. This plant is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands."
