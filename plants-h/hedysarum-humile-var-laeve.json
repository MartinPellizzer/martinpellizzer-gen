    "intro": "Hedysarum humile var. laeve, commonly known as the smooth meadow vetcher, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces yellow to reddish flowers in late spring. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in meadows and along stream banks. It is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration projects. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a desirable plant for garden settings."
