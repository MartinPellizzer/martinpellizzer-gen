    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. rarovelutum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and forest edges. The plant features a low-growing stem with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its slender stature and distinctive leaf morphology, which distinguish it from other hawkweed species."
