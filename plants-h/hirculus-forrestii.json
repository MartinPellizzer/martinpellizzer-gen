It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, feathery inflorescence and palmate leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,500 meters. Its flowers, which bloom in spring, are usually white or pale yellow, and it is known for its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
