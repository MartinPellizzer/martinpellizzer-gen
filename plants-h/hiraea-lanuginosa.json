    "intro": "Hiraea lanuginosa, commonly known as the wooly hiraea, is a flowering plant native to the southern regions of Africa. It is characterized by its soft, lanuginous (woolly) leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or arid environments. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Hiraea lanuginosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging climates."
