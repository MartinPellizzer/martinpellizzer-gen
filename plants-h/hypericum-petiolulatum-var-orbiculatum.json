    "intro": "Hypericum petiolulatum var. orbiculatum, commonly known as the round-leaf St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, yellow, four-petaled flowers that bloom in summer, typically from June to September. The leaves are oval-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant flowers and compact growth habit. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes."
