    "intro": "Hedysarum algidum var. algidum, commonly known as the alpine sweetvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Hedysarum algidum var. algidum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
