    "intro": "Hordeum himalayense, commonly known as Himalayan barley, is a wild grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central and South Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to three rows of\u9896\u679c (glumes) that enclose the seeds. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Hordeum himalayense is valued for its potential in ecological restoration and as a source of traditional food in some regions."
