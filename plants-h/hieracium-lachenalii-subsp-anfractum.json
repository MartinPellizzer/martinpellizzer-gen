    "intro": "Hieracium lachenalii subsp. anfractum, commonly known as the wrinkled hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. It thrives in dry meadows and rocky slopes, preferring well-drained soils. This subspecies is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and habitat preferences, making it a notable species in its native region."
