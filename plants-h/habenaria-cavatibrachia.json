    "intro": "Habenaria cavatibrachia, commonly known as the hollow-stemmed marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features a slender, often hollow stem and produces clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. Its leaves are usually linear and arranged along the stem, contributing to its overall grass-like appearance. Botanically, it is characterized by its specialized orchid structure and its adaptation to wetland habitats."
