    "intro": "Hydroglossum flexuosum, commonly known as the flexible water-plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features linear, grass-like leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Hydroglossum flexuosum plays an important role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
