    "intro": "Hoarea reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers with intricate, net-like vein patterns on the petals and sepals. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Hoarea reticulata has a sympodial growth habit, with each stem producing a cluster of leaves and flowers. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
