    "intro": "Hutchinsia alpina var. affinis, commonly known as the alpine hutchinsia, is a rare and specialized plant species native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, hairy leaves adapted to cold and dry conditions. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous environments. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
