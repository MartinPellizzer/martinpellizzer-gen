    "intro": "Hieracium juranum subsp. conocerinthe, commonly known as the Jura Hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and yellow flowers with ray florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. It is often found in meadows, slopes, and forest edges at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in several European countries."
