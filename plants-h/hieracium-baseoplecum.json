It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, consist of both ray and disk florets. The leaves are basal, forming a rosette, and are often hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
