    "intro": "Hovea leiocarpa, commonly known as the silky hovea, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, feathery foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody pod, which is typical of many leguminous species. Hovea leiocarpa is often found in sandy or rocky soils in arid and semi-arid regions."
