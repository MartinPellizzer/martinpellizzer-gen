    "intro": "Hylogyne oreades, commonly known as the mountain hylogyne, is a rare and delicate plant species native to high-altitude regions. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, with five petals and a distinct central stigma. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Hylogyne oreades is considered a vulnerable species."
