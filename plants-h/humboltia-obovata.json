    "intro": "Humboltia obovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed humboldtia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, obovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its woody stem and succulent leaves make it adapted to arid and coastal environments. Humboltia obovata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
