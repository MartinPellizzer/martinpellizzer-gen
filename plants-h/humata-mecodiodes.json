    "intro": "Humata mecodiodes, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth surface. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its natural habitat."
