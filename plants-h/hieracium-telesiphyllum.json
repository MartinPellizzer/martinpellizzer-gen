    "intro": "Hieracium telesiphyllum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its foliage is generally covered in fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The showy yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
