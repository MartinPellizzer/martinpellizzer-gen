    "intro": "Hieracium vaidae, commonly known as Vaid's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically hairy and lance-shaped. Hieracium vaidae is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
