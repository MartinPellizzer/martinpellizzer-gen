    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracesium kihlmanii, commonly known as Kihlman's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a dense cluster. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
