    "intro": "Hordeum maritimum var. pavisii, commonly known as the sea barley, is a coastal grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both lemma and palea structures typical of the Poaceae family. The plant thrives in saline and sandy environments, showcasing adaptations such as reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a waxy coating, which helps protect against desiccation. Hordeum maritimum var. pavisii plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and is often found in maritime habitats."
