    "intro": "Hieracium alpinum subsp. xanthochrooides, commonly known as the yellow-haired hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features basal rosettes of dark green, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, yellowish hairs. The plant produces yellow to orange composite flowers arranged in a single, terminal head, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
