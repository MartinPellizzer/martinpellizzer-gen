    "intro": "Helichrysum orientale, commonly known as the oriental everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellow to golden-orange flowers that remain intact even after the plant has dried, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is known for its aromatic, slightly resinous scent. Helichrysum orientale is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
