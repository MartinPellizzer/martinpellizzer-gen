It is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are hairy and adapted to arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to dry environments, with a compact growth habit and deep root system."
