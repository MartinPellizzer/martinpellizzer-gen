    "intro": "Hedysarum bijugum, commonly known as the twinleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its compound leaves with two pairs of leaflets, giving it the \"twinleaf\" designation. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and woodland habitats. Hedysarum bijugum plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native ecosystems."
