    "intro": "Helosis mexicana var. andicola, commonly known as the Andean helosis, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, pale pink to purple flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests and grasslands. Its growth is typically low to the ground, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
