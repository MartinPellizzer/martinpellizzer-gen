    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. torticaule, commonly known as the bent-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that curve inward, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats such as meadows and roadsides. The subspecies is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and is often found in moist environments."
