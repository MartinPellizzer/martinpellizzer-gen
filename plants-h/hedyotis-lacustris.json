It typically grows in marshy areas, along the edges of ponds, and in other moist habitats. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Hedyotis lacustris is known for its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
