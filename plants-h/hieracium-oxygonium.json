    "intro": "Hieracium oxygonium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its stems are upright and sometimes hairy. Hieracium oxygonium is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
