It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in dense spikes. It thrives in wet or marshy environments, making it a common sight in freshwater habitats. Its rapid growth and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for aquatic gardening and water feature landscaping."
