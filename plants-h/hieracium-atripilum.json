    "intro": "Hieracium atripilum, commonly known as the black hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a rough texture. Hieracium atripilum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
