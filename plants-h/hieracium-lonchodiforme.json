    "intro": "Hieracium lonchodiforme, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces yellow flowers with ray florets, typically blooming from June to August. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, which helps in reducing water loss. Hieracium lonchodiforme is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
