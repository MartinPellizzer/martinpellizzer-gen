    "intro": "Hysteria, commonly known as the \"hysterical plant,\" is a term that refers to a group of flowering plants in the genus *Pteridium*, which includes the bracken fern. These plants are characterized by their large, feather-like fronds and are often found in moist, shaded environments. Hysteria species are perennial and reproduce through spores, with a complex life cycle involving both sporophyte and gametophyte stages. They are also known for their ability to thrive in disturbed soils, making them common in forested areas and along roadsides. However, some species of hysteria can be toxic to livestock and humans if ingested."
