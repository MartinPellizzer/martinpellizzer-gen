    "intro": "Hordeum giganteum, commonly known as giant barley, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and large, loose panicles of pale green to golden spikelets. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, temperate climates with well-drained soils. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a rough texture, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. While not widely cultivated for food, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop for livestock."
