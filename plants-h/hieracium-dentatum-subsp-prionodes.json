    "intro": "Hieracium dentatum subsp. prionodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate leaves with serrated edges, and its flowers are yellow, consisting of a single central disc surrounded by ray florets. It produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal, and its root system is fibrous, contributing to soil stabilization. This subspecies is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and medicinal properties in some species."
