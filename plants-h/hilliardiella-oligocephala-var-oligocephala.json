    "intro": "Hilliardiella oligocephala var. oligocephala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hilliardiella, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, often in dense clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
