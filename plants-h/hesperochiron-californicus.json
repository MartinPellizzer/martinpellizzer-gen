    "intro": "Hesperochiron californicus, commonly known as the California milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its showy, pink to orange flowers. The plant has hairy stems and oval, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a fuzzy texture. It produces a milky sap that contains latex, which is toxic to some animals. Hesperochiron californicus plays an important role in supporting local pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies."
