    "intro": "Hohenbergia isepponae, commonly known as the Isepponae Hohenbergia, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped growth habit and its striking, often brightly colored foliage. The leaves are typically long and strap-like, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually yellow or orange, adding a subtle contrast to its vibrant leaves. This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low light requirements and ability to thrive in humid environments."
