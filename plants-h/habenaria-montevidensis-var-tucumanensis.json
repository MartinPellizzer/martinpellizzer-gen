    "intro": "Habenaria montevidensis var. tucumanensis, commonly known as the Tucuman orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Uruguay. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in two rows. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinct lip, which is a common feature in the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
