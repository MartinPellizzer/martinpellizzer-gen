    "intro": "Huperzia selago subsp. arctica, commonly known as the Arctic huperzia, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, evergreen foliage. It is a small, cryptogamic plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in Arctic and alpine regions. The plant has a distinctive, creeping growth habit with densely packed, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. It produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are clustered in small, clustered structures called strobili. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is an important component of the vegetation in its native habitats."
