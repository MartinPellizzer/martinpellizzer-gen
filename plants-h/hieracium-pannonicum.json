    "intro": "Hieracium pannonicum, commonly known as the Pannonian hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, and it can form dense mats due to its spreading growth habit. Its yellow flowers are surrounded by leaf-like bracts, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium pannonicum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
