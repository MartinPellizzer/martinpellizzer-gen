    "intro": "Helichrysum bidwillii, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, yellow-orange flower heads that resemble small suns. The plant produces small, bract-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. The flowers are long-lasting when dried, which is why it is often used in floral arrangements."
