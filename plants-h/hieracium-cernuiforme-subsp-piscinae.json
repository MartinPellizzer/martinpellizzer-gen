    "intro": "Hieracium cernuiforme subsp. piscinae, commonly known as the Piscina hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically woolly and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
