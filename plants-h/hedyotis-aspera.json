    "intro": "Hedyotis aspera, commonly known as the rough-stemmed bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Asia and Australia. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes many shrubs and herbs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its small, white or yellowish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and the leaves are often covered in fine hairs. Hedyotis aspera is characterized by its hairy stems and elliptical leaves, which contribute to its rough texture."
