    "intro": "Hibiscus erodiifolius, commonly known as the sand hibiscus, is a shrub native to coastal regions of the United States and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that resemble those of the erodium plant, hence its scientific name. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. Hibiscus erodiifolius is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
