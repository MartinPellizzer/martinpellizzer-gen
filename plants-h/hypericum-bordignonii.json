    "intro": "Hypericum bordignonii, commonly known as the alpine St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forest edges. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
