    "intro": "Hydnora abyssinica var. quinquefida, commonly known as the Abyssinian hydnora, is a parasitic plant native to the arid regions of Ethiopia. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of Euphorbia species. The plant produces a distinctive, fleshy, reddish structure that resembles a flower, though it does not perform photosynthesis. Its unique morphology and parasitic lifestyle make it an intriguing subject in botanical studies. It is also notable for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is believed to attract pollinators."
