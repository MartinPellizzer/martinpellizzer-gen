    "intro": "Hamosa calycosa, commonly known as the scarlet globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its bright red to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its stems are often hairy. Hamosa calycosa thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
