    "intro": "Harveya purpurea, commonly known as the purple harveya, is a striking member of the Campanulaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. The plant is characterized by its vibrant purple to violet flowers, which bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Harveya purpurea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil with full sun exposure."
