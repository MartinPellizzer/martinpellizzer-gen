It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, and it can reach heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery-white down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The flowers bloom in the summer, producing yellow to orange disc florets surrounded by white to pale yellow ray florets."
