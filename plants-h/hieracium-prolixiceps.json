    "intro": "Hieracium prolixiceps, commonly known as the long-stemmed hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Hieracium prolixiceps is native to Europe and has been introduced to other parts of the world, where it can sometimes become invasive."
