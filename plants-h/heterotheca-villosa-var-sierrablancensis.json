    "intro": "Heterotheca villosa var. sierrablancensis, commonly known as the Sierra Blancensis goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations to reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
