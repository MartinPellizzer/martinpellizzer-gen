    "intro": "Hechtia pitcairniifolia, commonly known as the Pitcairn hechtia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, powdery bloom. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright red flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its island habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
