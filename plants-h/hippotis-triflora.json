    "intro": "Hippotis triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its flowers are small and usually white or pale purple, arranged in clusters of three. Hippotis triflora is a carnivorous plant that relies on both photosynthesis and the digestion of trapped prey for survival."
