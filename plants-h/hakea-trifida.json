    "intro": "Hakea trifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes. Hakea trifida is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
