    "intro": "Hoya wightii, commonly known as the Wight's wax plant, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, often variegated leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Hoya wightii is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tropical rainforests. It is popular among plant enthusiasts for its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
