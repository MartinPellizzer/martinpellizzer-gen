    "intro": "Heterosperma depressum, commonly known as the flat-leaf water clover, is a species of aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its floating leaves, which are oval-shaped and have a distinct waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the sediment in the water, contributing to the ecosystem's health. Heterosperma depressum is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments."
