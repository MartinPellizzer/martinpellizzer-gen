    "intro": "Heliocereus speciosus var. serratus, commonly known as the serrated night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its spineless stems and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that open at night. The plant thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few hours, and are pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and unique blooming behavior."
