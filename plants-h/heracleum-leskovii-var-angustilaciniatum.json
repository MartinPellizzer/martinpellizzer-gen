    "intro": "Heracleum leskovii var. angustilaciniatum, commonly known as narrow-leaf cow parsnip, is a variant of the cow parsnip species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a biennial plant characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, deeply lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots are thick and fleshy, and while not as commonly used as other parsnips, they can be edible when properly prepared. The plant is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks."
