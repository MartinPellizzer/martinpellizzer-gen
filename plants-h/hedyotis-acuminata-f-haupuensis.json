It is a small herbaceous plant characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and small white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. It has a compact growth habit and produces tiny, clustered fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
