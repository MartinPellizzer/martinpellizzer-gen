    "intro": "Heteroneurum argutum, commonly known as the rough-stemmed clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Huperjaniaceae. It is characterized by its small, clustered, needle-like leaves and a creeping or upright growth habit. The plant produces sporangia in specialized structures called strobili, which are typically found at the tips of the stems. Heteroneurum argutum is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, which is a common method among primitive vascular plants."
