The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for humans and animals. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
