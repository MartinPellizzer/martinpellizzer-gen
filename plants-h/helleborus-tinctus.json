It is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves and its showy, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodland habitats. Its flowers have a distinctive appearance, with a central rosette of petals and a unique, almost translucent quality.
