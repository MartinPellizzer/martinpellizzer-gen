It features a sympodial growth habit with a pseudobulb and produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinct lip. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating in water, adapting to its aquatic environment. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the water, and it is often found in marshy or swampy areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
