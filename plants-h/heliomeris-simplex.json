    "intro": "Heliomeris simplex, commonly known as the silverleaf heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring silvery-gray foliage that reflects sunlight. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, which bloom in the early morning and close by midday. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Heliomeris simplex is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
