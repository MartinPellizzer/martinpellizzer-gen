    "intro": "Hypericum ilicianum, commonly known as the creeping St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with woody stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically in clusters of three to five. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers have five petals and numerous stamens. Hypericum ilicianum is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses."
