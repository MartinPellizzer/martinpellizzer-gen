    "intro": "Hesperaster strictus, commonly known as the narrowleaf hesperaster, is a species of flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and specialized structures called phyllaries. The plant typically grows as a low, mat-forming shrub with narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. Its small, daisy-like flowers are usually yellow or orange, and they bloom in the spring and early summer. Hesperaster strictus is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh, dry environments."
