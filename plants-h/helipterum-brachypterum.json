    "intro": "Helipterum brachypterum, commonly known as the narrow-winged everlasting pea, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Leguminosae, also known as the Fabaceae family, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, and it is known for its ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Helipterum brachypterum is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
