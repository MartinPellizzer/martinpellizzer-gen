    "intro": "Helictotrichon pratense var. alpinum, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions with low temperatures and strong winds. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
