It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. This variant is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and morphological traits that set it apart from other hawkweed species."
