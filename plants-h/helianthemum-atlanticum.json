    "intro": "Helianthemum atlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a dense, evergreen foliage with leathery leaves that help it withstand coastal conditions. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky coastal areas. Helianthemum atlanticum is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient plant in harsh maritime environments."
