    "intro": "Haplophyllum virgatum var. scopulatum, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and coastal areas of the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with slender, branched stems that often grow in dense clusters. The plant features small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often harsh habitat. The plant is adapted to poor, well-drained soils and is often found in maritime environments."
