    "intro": "Hordeum caudatum, commonly known as the tufted barley or wild barley, is a species of grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and loose clusters of spikelets at the ends of its branches. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and wastelands. Its leaves are narrow and bluish-green, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Hordeum caudatum is considered a wild relative of cultivated barley and has ecological and potential agricultural significance."
