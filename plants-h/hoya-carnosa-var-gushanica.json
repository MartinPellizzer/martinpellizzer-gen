It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of pink or white. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hoya carnosa var. gushanica is prized for its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
