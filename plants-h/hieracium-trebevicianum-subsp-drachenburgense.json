    "intro": "Hieracium trebevicianum subsp. drachenburgense, commonly known as the Drachenburg hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lanceolate leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in the summer months. The plant is native to Central Europe and is often found in dry, calcareous grasslands and rocky habitats. It has a fibrous root system and is typically low-growing, with stems that are somewhat woody at the base. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
