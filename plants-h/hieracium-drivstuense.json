    "intro": "Hieracium drivstuense, commonly known as the Drivstun hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of northern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and often hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. It has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowering stems bear yellow ray florets. The species is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution."
