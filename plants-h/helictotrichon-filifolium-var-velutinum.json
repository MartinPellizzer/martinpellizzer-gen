    "intro": "Helictotrichon filifolium var. velutinum, commonly known as the silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, silky hairs that cover the leaves and stems, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle with small, spikelet-like flowers, which are usually blue to purple in color. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
