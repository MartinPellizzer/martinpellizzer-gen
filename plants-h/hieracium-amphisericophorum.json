It belongs to the daisy family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually basal, with a rough, hairy texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in the summer months. Hieracium amphisericophorum is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems."
