    "intro": "Hemionitis pulchella, commonly known as the pretty water fern, is a small aquatic fern native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. The plant has delicate, feathery fronds that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. Its rhizomes form dense mats, which help stabilize sediments and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Hemionitis pulchella is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological benefits in wetland environments."
