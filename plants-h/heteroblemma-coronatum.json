    "intro": "Heteroblemma coronatum, commonly known as the crown fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive crown-like arrangement of fronds, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its leaves are usually broad and have a delicate, feathery appearance. Heteroblemma coronatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
