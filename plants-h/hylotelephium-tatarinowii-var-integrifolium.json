It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, arranged in a dense rosette formation. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers during the summer months, which are borne on tall, upright stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value contribute to its appeal in both horticultural and ecological contexts."
