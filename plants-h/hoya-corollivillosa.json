    "intro": "Hoya corollivillosa, commonly known as the \"Flower of the Forest,\" is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its waxy, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Hoya corollivillosa thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
