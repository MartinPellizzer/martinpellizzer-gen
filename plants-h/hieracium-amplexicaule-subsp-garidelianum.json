It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy habitats and is distinguished by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow flowers. It has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
