    "intro": "Hoya chloroleuca, commonly known as the white-veined wax plant, is a species of epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, and often variegated leaves that display a unique combination of green and white veins. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming during the summer months. Hoya chloroleuca is a slow-growing plant that thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. Its foliage and flowering make it a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
