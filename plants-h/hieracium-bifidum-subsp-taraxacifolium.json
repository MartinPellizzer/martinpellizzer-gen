    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. taraxacifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist meadows and grasslands, often forming dense colonies. Due to its rapid growth and spread, it is considered a potential weed in some regions."
