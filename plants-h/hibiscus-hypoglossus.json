    "intro": "Hibiscus hypoglossus, commonly known as the swamp hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically appearing in late summer to early fall. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, swampy environments. Hibiscus hypoglossus is a herbaceous perennial that can grow up to 6 feet tall, with a robust root system that helps it survive in waterlogged soils. Its flowers are not only ornamental but also attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
