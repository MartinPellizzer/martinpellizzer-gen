    "intro": "Hapalochilus chrysochilus, commonly known as the golden-leafed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-green leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its botanical features include long, narrow leaves and a unique inflorescence with pendant-like flowers. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many regions."
