    "intro": "Helichrysum burchellii, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its striking yellow to orange flowers that resemble small suns. The plant produces small, papery bracts that persist after the flowers have faded, giving it a long-lasting appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Helichrysum burchellii is also valued for its aromatic foliage and is often used in traditional medicine."
