It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that can range in color from white to pink, depending on soil pH. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, often found in moist, woodland habitats. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
