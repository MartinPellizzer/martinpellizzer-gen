    "intro": "Hesperochloa kingii, commonly known as King's grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought conditions. Hesperochloa kingii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
