    "intro": "Hippophae angustifolia, commonly known as sandthrift, is a shrub native to the cold climates of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, orange berries that are rich in vitamin C and other nutrients. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal and arctic regions. Due to its hardiness, it is used for erosion control and as a source of edible fruits."
