    "intro": "Helictochloa pratensis, commonly known as the meadow hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spikelet cluster, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Helictochloa pratensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
