    "intro": "Heterosperma brandegeei, commonly known as the Brandegee's heterosperma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae, native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized palm characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and clustered, small, white to yellowish flowers. The plant produces drupes, which are fleshy fruits containing a single seed, typical of the Arecaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
