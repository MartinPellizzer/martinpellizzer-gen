    "intro": "Heliophila succulenta, commonly known as the sun-leaf plant, is a succulent species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the warm season. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, forming dense mats. Heliophila succulenta is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and aesthetic appeal."
