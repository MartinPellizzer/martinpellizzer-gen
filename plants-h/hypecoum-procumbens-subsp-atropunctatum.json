    "intro": "Hypecoum procumbens subsp. atropunctatum, commonly known as the purple-spotted bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing herb with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by insects. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, a common reproductive strategy in the Brassicaceae family. This subspecies is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils."
