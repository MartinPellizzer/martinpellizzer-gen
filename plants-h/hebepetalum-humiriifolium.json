    "intro": "Hebepetalum humiriifolium, commonly known as the swamp petal orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific wetland habitats in Australia. It is characterized by its small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically from July to September. The plant has strap-like, narrow leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water, adapted to its aquatic or semi-aquatic environment. It thrives in poorly drained soils and is often found in swampy areas or near freshwater bodies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
