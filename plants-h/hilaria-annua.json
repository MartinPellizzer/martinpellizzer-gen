    "intro": "Hilaria annua, commonly known as annual bluegrass, is a low-growing grass species native to the eastern United States. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and disturbed areas. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with blue-gray flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fine, grass-like leaves are typically less than 1 inch in length, and it spreads primarily through seeds. Hilaria annua is a hardy plant that can tolerate drought and is sometimes used in low-maintenance landscaping."
