    "intro": "Hieracium waldsteinii subsp. delpinoi, commonly known as the Delpino hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its flowering heads composed of yellow disc flowers surrounded by white to pale yellow ray florets. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. It has basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and can reach heights of up to 30 cm. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
