    "intro": "Hydroglossum elegans, commonly known as the water bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, erect stems that bear showy blue to violet flowers with white markings, which bloom from June to August. The plant has heart-shaped, broad leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic environments. It thrives in shallow water, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Hydroglossum elegans plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining wetland biodiversity."
