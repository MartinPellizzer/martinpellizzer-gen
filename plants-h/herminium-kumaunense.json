    "intro": "Herminium kumaunense, commonly known as the Kumaun marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, showy inflorescence with several pale yellow to greenish-white flowers, which are often adorned with dark markings. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in mountain meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
