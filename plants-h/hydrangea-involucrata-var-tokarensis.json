It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that typically range from white to pink, depending on soil pH. The plant features broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
