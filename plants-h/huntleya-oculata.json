    "intro": "Huntleya oculata, commonly known as the eye-leaf plant, is a striking member of the Aizoaceae family, native to South Africa. It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often brightly colored leaves that resemble eyes, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its flowers are small, star-shaped, and usually appear in shades of yellow or orange, adding visual interest. Huntleya oculata is a succulent, meaning it stores water in its leaves, allowing it to survive in arid conditions."
