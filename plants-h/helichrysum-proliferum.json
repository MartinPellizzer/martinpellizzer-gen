    "intro": "Helichrysum proliferum, commonly known as the many-flowered everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers. The plant produces numerous tiny, papery bracts that give it a fluffy appearance, which is why it is also called the \"everlasting\" plant. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms that retain their color even when dried."
