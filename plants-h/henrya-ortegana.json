    "intro": "Henrya ortegana, commonly known as the Otter's garden, is a rare and striking plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and fleshy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in spring. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the arid and rocky environments of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is highly valued in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
