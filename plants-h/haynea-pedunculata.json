    "intro": "Haynea pedunculata, commonly known as the coastal hay or sea hay, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered in a fine layer of salt-resistant hairs. Haynea pedunculata plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing coastal erosion."
