    "intro": "Hymenolepis hymenolepioides, commonly known as the dwarf tapeworm, is a parasitic flatworm belonging to the family Hymenolepididae. It primarily infects rodents, particularly mice, and is characterized by its small size and complex life cycle involving both definitive and intermediate hosts. The adult worm resides in the small intestine of the host and attaches to the intestinal wall using its scolex, which features a spherical structure with hooks and grooves. Its morphology includes a segmented body with a head, neck, and a series of proglottids that mature and detach to release eggs. The plant aspect is not applicable, as Hymenolepis hymenolepioides is an animal parasite, not a botanical species."
