    "intro": "Hymenophyllum telfairianum, commonly known as the Telfair's filmy fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and are protected by a specialized indusium. This fern is notable for its ability to retain moisture in its thin, papery leaves, which are adapted to its moist, shaded habitat."
