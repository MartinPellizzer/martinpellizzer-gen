    "intro": "Hymenophyllum ciliatum var. imbricatum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its soft, moss-like fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in forest understories or on rocky outcrops. Its small, sporangia are clustered in intricate patterns on the underside of the fronds. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
