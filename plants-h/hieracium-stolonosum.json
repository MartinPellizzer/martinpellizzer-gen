    "intro": "Hieracium stolonosum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in a single head, which are surrounded by bracts and have a distinctive appearance. It spreads via stolons, allowing it to form dense mats in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its aggressive growth, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
