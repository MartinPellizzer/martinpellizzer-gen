    "intro": "Heliconia mooreana, commonly known as the Moore's heliconia, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered within the bracts, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense clumps in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are large, broad, and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental value in tropical gardens."
