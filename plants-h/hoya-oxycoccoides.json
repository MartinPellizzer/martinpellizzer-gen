    "intro": "Hoya oxycoccoides, commonly known as the starry waxy plant, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often variegated with shades of white and green. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white in color. It is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal. Hoya oxycoccoides thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
