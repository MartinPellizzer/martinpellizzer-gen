It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in coastal and dry forest habitats, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
