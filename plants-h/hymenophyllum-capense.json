    "intro": "Hymenophyllum capense, commonly known as the Cape spleenwort, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in dense forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are located on the underside of the leaves. Hymenophyllum capense is known for its ability to tolerate high humidity and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
