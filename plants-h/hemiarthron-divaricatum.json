    "intro": "Hemiarthron divaricatum, commonly known as the variable liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant exhibits a dichotomous branching pattern, which contributes to its common name. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia. Hemiarthron divaricatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
