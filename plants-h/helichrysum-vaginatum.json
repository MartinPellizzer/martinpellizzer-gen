    "intro": "Helichrysum vaginatum, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, yellow-orange inflorescences that resemble small sunflowers, which are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rocky or sandy environments. It is often found in open woodlands and along coastal areas, where it benefits from full sun exposure. Helichrysum vaginatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
