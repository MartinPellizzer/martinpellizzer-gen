    "intro": "Heliophila gracilis, commonly known as slender heliophyte, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Hydrophyllaceae. It is typically found in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond edges, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features slender, erect stems that bear small, white or pale blue flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its aquatic habitat. Heliophila gracilis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
