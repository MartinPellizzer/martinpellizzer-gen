    "intro": "Hemionitis lonchophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the water. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its small, spore-bearing structures are located on the underside of the leaves, aiding in its reproductive cycle. Hemionitis lonchophylla plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
