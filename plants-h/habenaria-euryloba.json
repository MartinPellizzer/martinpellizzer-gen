    "intro": "Habenaria euryloba, commonly known as the broad-lobed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with a short rhizome and a rosette of linear, grass-like leaves. The plant produces tall, erect flowering stems that bear multiple showy, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with distinctive, spurred petals. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. This orchid thrives in moist, shaded forest habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
