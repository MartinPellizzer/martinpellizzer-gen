    "intro": "Hieracium cerobaphum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are surrounded by ray florets that resemble petals. Hieracium cerobaphum is often found in temperate regions and can sometimes become invasive in non-native environments."
