    "intro": "Hymenaea splendida, commonly known as the Brazilwood tree, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, aromatic bark and its ability to produce a valuable red heartwood used historically in the production of dyes and musical instruments. The tree has compound leaves with long, slender leaflets and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by woody pods containing flat, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered vulnerable and is protected in several conservation programs."
