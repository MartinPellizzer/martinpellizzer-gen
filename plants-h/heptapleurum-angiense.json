    "intro": "Heptapleurum angiense, commonly known as the African nettle, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Urticaceae. It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are often overlooked due to the plant's more prominent foliage. Heptapleurum angiense is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its leaves are also used as a vegetable in some parts of Africa."
