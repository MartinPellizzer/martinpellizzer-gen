    "intro": "Hicriopteris pinnata, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern characterized by its large, feathery fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are bi-directionally pinnate, with a distinctive, delicate appearance. Hicriopteris pinnata plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
