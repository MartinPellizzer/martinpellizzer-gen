    "intro": "Hemionitis depauperata, commonly known as the poor man's fern, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to arid regions of North America. It has delicate, finely divided leaves that form a dense mat, often growing close to the ground. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. Hemionitis depauperata is often used in xeriscaping due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and with minimal irrigation."
