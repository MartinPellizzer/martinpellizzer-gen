    "intro": "Hedysarum imbricatum, commonly known as the mountain peavine, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical seed pods that contain small, round seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and alpine meadows. Hedysarum imbricatum plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria."
