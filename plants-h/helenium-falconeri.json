    "intro": "Helenium falconeri, commonly known as the Falconeri's sneezeweed, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to the high Andes of Peru. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces large, showy yellow-orange flower heads with prominent central disk flowers, typical of the genus Helenium. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Helenium falconeri thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat."
