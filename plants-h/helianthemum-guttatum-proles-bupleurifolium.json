It is a low-growing shrub with fleshy, often hairy leaves that are typically green with red or purple markings. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to arid environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
