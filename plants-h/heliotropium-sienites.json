    "intro": "Heliotropium sienites, commonly known as the African heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant features hairy, alternate leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from purple to pink. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in semi-arid environments. The plant's name is derived from its tendency to follow the sun, similar to the behavior of true heliotropes."
