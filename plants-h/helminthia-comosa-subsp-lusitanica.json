    "intro": "Helminthia comosa subsp. lusitanica, commonly known as the Lusitanian hairy bellflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and blue to violet bell-shaped flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical Helminthia comosa, particularly in leaf and flower structure. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological and evolutionary significance."
