    "intro": "Hypolepis resinifera, commonly known as the resin fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its pinnately compound fronds that are often covered in a fine, resinous coating, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in various soil types. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing year-round foliage in its natural habitat."
