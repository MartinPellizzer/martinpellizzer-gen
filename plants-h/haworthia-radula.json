    "intro": "Haworthia radula, commonly known as the narrow-leafed haworthia, is a small, compact succulent native to South Africa. It features rosettes of narrow, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the tips. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, emerging from the center of the rosette. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or indoor cultivation. Haworthia radula is prized for its low maintenance and unique, elegant appearance."
