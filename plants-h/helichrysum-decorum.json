It features small, daisy-like yellow flowers that are densely packed in clusters, giving it a fluffy appearance. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting flowers, which retain their color even when dried."
