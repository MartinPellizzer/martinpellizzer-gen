It is characterized by its vibrant pink to red bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are often overlooked due to the showy bracts. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Hilsenbergia apetala is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes other flowering plants such as hibiscus and cotton."
