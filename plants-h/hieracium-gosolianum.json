    "intro": "Hieracium gosolianum, commonly known as the Gosloian hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a tall flowering stem that bears yellow composite flowers. Native to southern Europe, it thrives in meadows and grasslands. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its aggressive growth habit."
