    "intro": "Hedera helix var. marginata-argentea, commonly known as the silver-leaf ivy, is a variant of the common ivy characterized by its striking variegated foliage. Its leaves are typically a mix of bright white and light green, with a silvery edge that gives it a distinctive appearance. This plant is a climbing vine with tendrils that allow it to attach to surfaces and grow vertically. It thrives in indirect light and prefers moderate humidity, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. The variegation is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production, resulting in its unique leaf pattern."
