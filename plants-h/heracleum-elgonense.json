    "intro": "Heracleum elgonense, commonly known as Elgon cowparsley, is a perennial herb native to East Africa, particularly found in the highlands of Kenya and Uganda. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, fern-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, a feature typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest margins and grasslands. Heracleum elgonense is valued for its ornamental appearance and has traditional uses in some local communities."
