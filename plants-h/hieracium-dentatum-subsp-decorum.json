    "intro": "Hieracium dentatum subsp. decorum, commonly known as the showy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear clusters of yellow or orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges, and the flowers are surrounded by pale yellow ray florets. The subspecies decorum is distinguished by its more showy and larger flowers compared to other members of the species."
