It is a perennial herb that typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features small, yellowish to white flowers arranged in a composite head, which is characteristic of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are usually hairy and lance-shaped, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The subspecies is distinguished by its white to pale yellow flower heads, which set it apart from other members of the Hieracium genus."
