It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 meter, featuring woody stems and alternate, ovate leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are borne in clusters at the ends of the branches. Hibbertia malleolacea is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal regions. It is an important plant for local pollinators and has cultural significance in Indigenous Australian communities."
