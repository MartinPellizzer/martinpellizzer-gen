    "intro": "Humboltia ceratothallis, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a distinctive red throat. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, featuring thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces capsules as its fruit, containing numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind. Humboltia ceratothallis is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
