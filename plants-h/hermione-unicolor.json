    "intro": "Hermione unicolor, commonly known as the single-color herb, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its striking, single-colored petals that range from deep crimson to pale blue, depending on the variety. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down. It blooms during the late spring and early summer, producing clusters of fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, Hermione unicolor is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
