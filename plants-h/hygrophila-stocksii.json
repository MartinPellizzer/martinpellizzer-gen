    "intro": "Hygrophila stocksii, commonly known as the water hyssop, is a semi-aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to water environments. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in spikes, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hygrophila stocksii is often cultivated in ponds and water gardens for its ornamental value and ability to help control algae. It thrives in shallow, still or slowly moving water with moderate to high light exposure."
