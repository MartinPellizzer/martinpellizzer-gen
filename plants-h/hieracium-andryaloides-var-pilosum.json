    "intro": "Hieracium andryaloides var. pilosum, commonly known as the silky hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of basal, woolly, and often reddish leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Due to its hairy foliage and showy flowers, it is both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native habitats."
