    "intro": "Helicteres macropetala, commonly known as the large-flowered helicteres, is a tropical shrub native to Central America and parts of South America. It is characterized by its showy, palmate leaves and clusters of yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces small, spiny fruits that contain seeds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
