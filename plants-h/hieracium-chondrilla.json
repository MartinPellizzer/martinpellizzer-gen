    "intro": "Hieracium chondrilla, commonly known as mouse-ear hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It has small, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed."
