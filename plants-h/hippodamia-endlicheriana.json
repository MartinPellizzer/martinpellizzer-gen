It is characterized by its bright red elytra with black spots, typically numbering ten on the pronotum and six on each wing cover. This beetle plays an important role in biological control by preying on aphids and other small insect pests. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including gardens, woodlands, and agricultural fields. The plant it is associated with is the common nettle, where it lays its eggs and feeds on the aphids that infest the plant."
