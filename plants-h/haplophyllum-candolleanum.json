It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss.
