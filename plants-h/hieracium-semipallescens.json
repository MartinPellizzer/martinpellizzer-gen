    "intro": "Hieracium semipallescens, commonly known as the pale hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with ray florets. Hieracium semipallescens is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some habitats."
