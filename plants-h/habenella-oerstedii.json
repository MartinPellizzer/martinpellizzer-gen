    "intro": "Habenella oerstedii, commonly known as the Oersted's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor soils, often in bogs or marshes. Its leaves are slender and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Habenella oerstedii is known for its unique method of capturing prey, which it uses to supplement its nutrient intake in its challenging habitat."
