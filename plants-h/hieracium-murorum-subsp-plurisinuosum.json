It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and open habitats such as roadsides and grasslands. The plant has distinctive, hairy leaves with prominent veins and produces yellow flowers in early summer. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from other Hieracium species, particularly in leaf structure and flowering patterns."
