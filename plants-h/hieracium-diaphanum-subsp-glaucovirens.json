    "intro": "Hieracium diaphanum subsp. glaucovirens, commonly known as the glaucous hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to central and southern Europe. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of basal leaves and produces yellow composite flowers. The plant is characterized by its glaucous (waxy) coating on the leaves and stems, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The subspecies is distinguished by its specific leaf and flower morphology compared to other members of the Hieracium genus."
