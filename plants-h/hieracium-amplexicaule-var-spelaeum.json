    "intro": "Hieracium amplexicaule var. spelaeum, commonly known as the cave groundsel, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to subterranean environments. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and yellowish flowers. This variety thrives in dark, humid cave systems, where it relies on limited light and specific moisture conditions. Its morphology includes a short, often sprawling stem and reduced leaves that help minimize water loss. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species with limited geographic distribution."
