    "intro": "Hypericum hypericoides subsp. prostratum, commonly known as creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are opposite, oval, and covered in fine hairs. The plant is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, often spreading along the ground. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its medicinal properties have been historically associated with its hypericin content, though it is less commonly used today than other Hypericum species."
