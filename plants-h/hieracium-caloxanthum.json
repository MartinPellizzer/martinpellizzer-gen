    "intro": "Hieracium caloxanthum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its yellow flowers, which bloom from late spring to early summer, are composed of numerous small florets arranged in a flat, disc-like structure. Hieracium caloxanthum is known for its spreading growth habit and ability to form dense colonies, making it both a common wildflower and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
