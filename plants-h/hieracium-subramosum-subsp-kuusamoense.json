    "intro": "Hieracium subramosum subsp. kuusamoense, commonly known as the Kuusamo hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern Finland and parts of Scandinavia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow disk flowers surrounded by ray florets. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils in forested or wetland habitats. It has a compact growth form with hairy stems and leaves, and its flowers bloom from late summer to early autumn. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
