    "intro": "Hanguana stenopoda, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hanguana, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils, making it a resilient species in its natural habitat. Hanguana stenopoda is often found in moist, open areas such as riverbanks and forest edges."
