It features large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter, typically in shades of red, white, or pink. The plant produces strap-like, linear leaves that are broad at the base and taper towards the tip. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a period of cool dormancy to initiate flowering. This species is popular among gardeners for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
