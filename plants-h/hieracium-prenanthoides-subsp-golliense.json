    "intro": "Hieracium prenanthoides subsp. golliense, commonly known as the alpine groundsel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features a basal rosette of narrowly lanceolate leaves and produces small, yellowish composite flowers in the summer. It is characterized by its compact growth form and is often found in open, sunny environments at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in certain regions."
