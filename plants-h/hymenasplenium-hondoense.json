    "intro": "Hymenasplenium hondoense, commonly known as the Hondo spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spores in clusters on the underside of its leaves, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
