    "intro": "Habenaria tenii, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are pollinated by various insects, including bees and flies, which are attracted by its scent. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
