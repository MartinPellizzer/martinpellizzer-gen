    "intro": "Haworthia laetevirens, commonly known as the Zulu Lily, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa. It features dense, fleshy leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, often with a bluish-green hue and white or translucent markings. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light. Due to its slow growth and striking appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
