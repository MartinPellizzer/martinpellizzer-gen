    "intro": "Hypericum amanum, commonly known as the yellow wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a distinctive sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. Hypericum amanum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
