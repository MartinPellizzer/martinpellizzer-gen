    "intro": "Hieracium radiatellum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow to orange flowers with a central disk. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Hieracium radiatellum is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
