    "intro": "Helianthemum hirtum var. lagascae, commonly known as the Lagasca rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a splash of color to rocky and coastal environments. The plant has silver-gray foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to Mediterranean-style landscapes."
