    "intro": "Hydrangea macrophylla f. prolifera, commonly known as the panicle hydrangea, is a compact, shrub-like form of the bigleaf hydrangea. It is characterized by its cone-shaped flower clusters, which range in color from white to pink depending on soil pH. The plant produces large, broad leaves that are dark green and often have a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden borders and containers. This variety is known for its hardiness and ability to bloom repeatedly throughout the growing season."
