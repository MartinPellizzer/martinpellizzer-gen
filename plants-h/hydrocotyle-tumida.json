    "intro": "Hydrocotyle tumida, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily in moist environments such as wetlands and marshes. Hydrocotyle tumida is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth and adaptability."
