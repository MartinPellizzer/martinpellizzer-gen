    "intro": "Hypericum reflexum, commonly known as the reflexed St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features small, yellow, four-petaled flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically oval with a slightly hairy surface. The plant is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit, with stems that often curl or reflex at the tips. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its botanical name reflects the reflexed nature of its flower petals, a key identifying feature."
