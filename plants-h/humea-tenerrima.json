    "intro": "Humea tenerrima, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying solely on its roots for sustenance. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in specific, moist, shaded environments, often found in pine rocklands. Due to its rarity and habitat loss, Humea tenerrima is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
