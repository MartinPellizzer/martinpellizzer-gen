It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can reach heights of up to 40 centimeters. Its leaves are hairy and lance-shaped, and the flowers are yellow with a central disc. It is often considered a weed but has ecological value by providing nectar for pollinators."
