    "intro": "Hekistocarpa minutiflora, commonly known as the tiny-flowered hekistocarp, is a small, herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in umbels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
