    "intro": "Heracleum dissectum subsp. moellendorffii, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, and its tall, branched stem covered in white, hairy bumps. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, which bloom in late summer. It is important to note that all parts of the plant contain phototoxic sap, which can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is often considered a noxious weed."
