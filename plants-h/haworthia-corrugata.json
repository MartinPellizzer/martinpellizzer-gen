    "intro": "Haworthia corrugata, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a compact, succulent perennial native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, bluish-green leaves with distinctive white to light green transverse stripes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the growing season. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. Haworthia corrugata is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
