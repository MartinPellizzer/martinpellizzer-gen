    "intro": "Haplopappus velutinus subsp. longipes, commonly known as the long-peduncled hairy pappus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and unique bracts. The subspecies is distinguished by its elongated peduncles and hairy foliage, which help it retain moisture in harsh environments. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to low-nutrient conditions. Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a habitat for small invertebrates."
