    "intro": "Hieracium froelichianum subsp. pseudopraealpinum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cold, moist environments. The plant features a basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its flowering stems are usually unbranched and bear several flower heads. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing alpine soils and supporting pollinator populations."
