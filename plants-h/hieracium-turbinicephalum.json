It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features yellowish to brownish ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring moist to moderately dry conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with rough or hairy surfaces, and it produces achenes as its seed dispersal mechanism."
