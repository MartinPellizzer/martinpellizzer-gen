It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries containing a single seed. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a distinct aromatic scent, making it a notable species in its native habitats.
