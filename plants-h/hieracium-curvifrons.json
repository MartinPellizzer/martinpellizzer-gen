    "intro": "Hieracium curvifrons, commonly known as the bent-horn hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are yellow with a central disc. Hieracium curvifrons is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a resilient and sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
