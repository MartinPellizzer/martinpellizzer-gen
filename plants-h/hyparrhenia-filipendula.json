    "intro": "Hyparrhenia filipendula, commonly known as the African grass or red grass, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often wind-pollinated. Hyparrhenia filipendula is adapted to dry environments and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. It has been used traditionally for thatching and as a source of fiber in some regions."
