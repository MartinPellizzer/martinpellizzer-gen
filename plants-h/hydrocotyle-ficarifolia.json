    "intro": "Hydrocotyle ficarifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf water shield, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the Americas. It features floating leaves with a waxy surface that help reduce water loss and support photosynthesis. The plant has small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in early summer. Its roots are adapted for anchoring in muddy substrates, and it often grows in shallow freshwater habitats. Hydrocotyle ficarifolia plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and stabilizing water bodies."
