    "intro": "Hechtia mapimiana, commonly known as the Mapim\u00ed hechtia, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family, characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that collect rainwater. The plant features vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to red, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are thick and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Hechtia mapimiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry conditions."
