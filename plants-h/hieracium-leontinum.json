    "intro": "Hieracium leontinum, commonly known as the lion's head hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, with hairy stems and serrated, heart-shaped leaves. Its bright yellow flowers appear in late spring to early summer, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
