    "intro": "Hedysarum villosum, commonly known as goat's beard, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces distinctive, feathery pods that contain kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks. Hedysarum villosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for ecological restoration projects."
