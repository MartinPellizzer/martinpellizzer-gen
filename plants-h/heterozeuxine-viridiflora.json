    "intro": "Heterozeuxine viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are scale-like and often remain hidden among the host's foliage. The species is found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in warm, humid environments."
