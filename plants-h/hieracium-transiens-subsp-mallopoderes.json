The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, with a distinctive basal rosette structure, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster. It is known for its rapid spread and ability to colonize new areas, making it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive."
