    "intro": "Hieracium depannatum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Hieracium depannatum is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes and its potential as an invasive species in some regions."
