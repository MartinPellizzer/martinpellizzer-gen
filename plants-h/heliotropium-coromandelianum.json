    "intro": "Heliotropium coromandelianum, commonly known as the Indian heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces clusters of small, violet to purple flowers. Its flowers have a distinctive scent that resembles vanilla, which is due to the presence of aromatic compounds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields."
