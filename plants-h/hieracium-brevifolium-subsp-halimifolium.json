    "intro": "Hieracium brevifolium subsp. halimifolium, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are covered in dense, white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowering stems bear yellow composite flowers, which are composed of many small florets arranged in a disk-like structure. This subspecies is often found in rocky or gravelly areas and is adapted to cold, harsh environmental conditions."
