    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. sagittibasis, commonly known as the arrowleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate to arrow-shaped leaves, which are often hairy and have a distinctive basal lobing. The plant produces yellow flowers in a single, erect head, surrounded by pale green bracts. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and roadsides. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
