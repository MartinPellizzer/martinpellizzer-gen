It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, and it thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are usually hairy and alternate, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Hieracium rhypolepis is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
