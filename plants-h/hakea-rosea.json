    "intro": "Hakea rosea, commonly known as the pink hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems and clusters of bright pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. Its flowers are adapted for nectar-feeding birds, particularly honeyeaters, making it an important part of the local ecosystem. Hakea rosea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
