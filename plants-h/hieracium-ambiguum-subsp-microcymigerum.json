    "intro": "Hieracium ambiguum subsp. microcymigerum, commonly known as the small-cyme hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and waste areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in small, compact clusters called cymes. This subspecies is notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
