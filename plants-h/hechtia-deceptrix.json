    "intro": "Hechtia deceptrix, commonly known as the deceptive hechtia, is a striking bromeliad native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, which is used by the plant for hydration. The leaves are typically blue-green in color with a waxy coating, and they often have intricate patterns of white or silver veins. It produces showy inflorescences with bright orange or red flowers that bloom in late summer. This plant is relatively low maintenance and thrives in bright, indirect light with good air circulation."
