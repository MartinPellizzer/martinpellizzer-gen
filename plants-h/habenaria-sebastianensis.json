    "intro": "Habenaria sebastianensis, commonly known as the Sebastian's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
