    "intro": "Hieracium beauverdianum, commonly known as the Italian hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its yellowish to reddish flower heads consist of both ray and disk florets, and it produces small, oval-shaped achenes as its seeds. Hieracium beauverdianum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
