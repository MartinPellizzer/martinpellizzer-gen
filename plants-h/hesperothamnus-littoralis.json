    "intro": "Hesperothamnus littoralis, commonly known as the coastal thornbush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, narrow leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in small umbels, adding a striking visual element to the landscape. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of coastal vegetation. Hesperothamnus littoralis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
