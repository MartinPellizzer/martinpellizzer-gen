These plants are characterized by their showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors, including purple, pink, and white. Humbertia species typically have thick, fleshy leaves that help them store water in their arid native environment. They are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their attractive appearance and ease of care. The genus includes several species, such as Humbertia grandiflora and Humbertia tenuifolia, which are popular in horticulture."
