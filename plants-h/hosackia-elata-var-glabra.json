    "intro": "Hosackia elata var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth prairie clover, is a flowering plant native to the central United States. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its trifoliate leaves and pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open prairies and disturbed soils, preferring full sun. Its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves distinguish it from other varieties of Hosackia. It plays an important role in ecological systems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil."
