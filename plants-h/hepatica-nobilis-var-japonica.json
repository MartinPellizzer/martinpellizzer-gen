It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves and showy, early spring flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, are often followed by distinctive seed pods. The leaves are usually heart-shaped and have a waxy surface, which helps protect the plant from moisture loss."
