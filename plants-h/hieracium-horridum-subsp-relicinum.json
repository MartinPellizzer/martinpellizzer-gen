    "intro": "Hieracium horridum subsp. relicinum, commonly known as the rough hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, stiff hairs, contributing to its rough texture. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides."
