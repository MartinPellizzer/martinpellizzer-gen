    "intro": "Hydroglossum pedatum, commonly known as the water bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, erect stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its root system consists of rhizomes, which help it establish in moist soil environments. Hydroglossum pedatum is typically found in marshes, pond margins, and along streams, where it thrives in consistently wet conditions."
