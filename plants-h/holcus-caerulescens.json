    "intro": "Holcus caerulescens, commonly known as blue grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green blades and forms dense, low-growing turf. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along streams. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in spikelets, and it reproduces through both seed and rhizomes. Holcus caerulescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
