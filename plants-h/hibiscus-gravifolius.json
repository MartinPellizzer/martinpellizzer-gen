    "intro": "Hibiscus gravifolius, commonly known as the heavy-leaved hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep pink, typically blooming in the summer months. Hibiscus gravifolius thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking both ornamental and ecological value."
