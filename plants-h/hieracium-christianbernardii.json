    "intro": "Hieracium christianbernardii, commonly known as Christian Bernard's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the European Alps. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, preferring well-drained soils. It produces yellow flowers with a central disc, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
