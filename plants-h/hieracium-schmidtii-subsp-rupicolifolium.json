    "intro": "Hieracium schmidtii subsp. rupicolifolium, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help it withstand harsh mountain conditions. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, adapting to the dry and windy environments it inhabits. Its flowers are yellow, forming dense clusters at the ends of the stems, and bloom during the summer months. This subspecies is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, reflecting its preference for well-drained, nutrient-poor habitats."
