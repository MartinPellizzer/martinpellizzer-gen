It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features a basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in late summer. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in high-altitude habitats. Its botanical structure supports its role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its ecosystem."
