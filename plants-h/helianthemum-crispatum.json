    "intro": "Helianthemum crispatum, commonly known as the wrinkled rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub with hairy, often prostrate stems that help it thrive in rocky or sandy soils. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in early spring, adding a vibrant touch to its arid habitat. The plant's leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is well adapted to full sun and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas."
