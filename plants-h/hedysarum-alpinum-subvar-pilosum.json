It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in elongated clusters, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Hedysarum alpinum subvar. pilosum is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and its use in traditional herbal medicine."
