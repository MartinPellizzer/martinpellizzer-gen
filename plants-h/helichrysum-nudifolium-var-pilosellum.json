It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and small, yellowish-orange flowers that resemble daisies. The plant is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flower heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting flowers, which retain their color when dried."
