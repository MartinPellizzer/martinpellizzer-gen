    "intro": "Helianthemum pugae, commonly known as the Pugae rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a low-growing shrub with small, leathery leaves and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, sunny conditions of its native habitat. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Helianthemum pugae is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
