It features a compact, branching structure with ribbed stems that bear spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it is well adapted to arid environments. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xerophytic collections due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
