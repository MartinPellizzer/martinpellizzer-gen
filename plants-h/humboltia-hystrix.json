    "intro": "Humboltia hystrix, commonly known as the spiny leaf tree, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in small spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the dry season. Its bark is thick and cork-like, providing structural support and helping it survive in arid conditions. Humboltia hystrix is often found in dry forests and scrublands, where it plays an important ecological role."
