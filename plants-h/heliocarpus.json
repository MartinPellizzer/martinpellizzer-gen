    "intro": "Heliocarpus, commonly known as the \"sun seed\" or \"sun fruit,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. They are characterized by their distinctive, woody fruits that are often covered in a thick, fibrous layer. The leaves are typically compound, with small, ovate leaflets, and the flowers are usually yellow or orange in color. Heliocarpus species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and riverbanks."
