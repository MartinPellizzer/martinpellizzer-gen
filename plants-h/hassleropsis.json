    "intro": "Hassleropsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, showy flowers that resemble ghosts, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to survive. Due to its fragility and habitat specificity, Hassleropsis is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
