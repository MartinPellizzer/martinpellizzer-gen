It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous tiny florets. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by spiky, bristly seed heads. The leaves are usually spiny and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
