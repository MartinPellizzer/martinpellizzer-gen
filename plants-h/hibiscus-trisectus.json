    "intro": "Hibiscus trisectus, commonly known as the three-lobed hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with five to seven petals and three distinct lobes on its leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and marshes, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and its flowers bloom in summer, producing a vibrant display of pink to red hues. Hibiscus trisectus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
