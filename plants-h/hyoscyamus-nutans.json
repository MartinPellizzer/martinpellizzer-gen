It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in dry, disturbed soils. The plant produces striking violet or yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are broad and lobed, and the fruit is a capsule containing numerous seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it has been used historically in both medicinal and hallucinogenic contexts."
