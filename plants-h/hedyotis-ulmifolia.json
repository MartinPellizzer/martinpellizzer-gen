    "intro": "Hedyotis ulmifolia, commonly known as the sweetleaf or false elder, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features opposite, elliptic leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its berries are red and edible, though they are typically consumed by birds rather than humans. Hedyotis ulmifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
