    "intro": "Habranthus andersonii var. cupreus, commonly known as the copperleaf lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, copper-colored bracts that resemble leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of strap-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
