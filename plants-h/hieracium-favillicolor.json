    "intro": "Hieracium favillicolor, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the summer months, and the leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. Hieracium favillicolor is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
