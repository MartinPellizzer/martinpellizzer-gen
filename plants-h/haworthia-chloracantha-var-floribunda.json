    "intro": "Haworthia chloracantha var. floribunda, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to South Africa. It features striking, fleshy leaves with distinctive white or yellowish markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers on slender stems during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
