    "intro": "Heliocarpus popayanensis var. schumannii, commonly known as the Schumann's Brazil nut tree, is a species native to the Amazon rainforest. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its rough, fissured bark and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, indehiscent fruits that contain a single large seed. The seeds are highly valued for their nutritional content and are often referred to as Brazil nuts. This variety is closely related to the commercially important H. obovatus, but it is less commonly cultivated."
