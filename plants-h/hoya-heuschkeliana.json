    "intro": "Hoya heuschkeliana, commonly known as the \"Coral Hoya,\" is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often variegated with white and green hues. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the summer months. Hoya heuschkeliana thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
