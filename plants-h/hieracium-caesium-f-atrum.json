    "intro": "Hieracium caesium f. atrum, commonly known as the Black Hawkweed, is a variant of the Hawkweed species native to Europe. It is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family, characterized by its dark purple to black flowers and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It produces small, yellowish to brownish seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can compete with native plant species in certain regions."
