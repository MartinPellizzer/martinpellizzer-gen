    "intro": "Hierochloe dregeana, commonly known as the dwarf blue grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
