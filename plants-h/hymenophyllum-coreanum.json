    "intro": "Hymenophyllum coreanum, commonly known as the Korean haircap moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, acrocarpous moss that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant features dense, cushion-like growth with closely appressed, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, hair-like structures. Its reproductive structures, called capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores through a peristome. Hymenophyllum coreanum is characterized by its delicate, intricate morphology and is often found in temperate regions of Asia."
