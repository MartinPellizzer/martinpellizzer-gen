    "intro": "Habenaria pleistadenia, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and Australia. It features a dense, mat-forming growth habit with long, slender stems that bear numerous small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in a loose, trichas-like inflorescence. The plant's leaves are linear and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. The species is notable for its delicate appearance and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
