    "intro": "Hymenostemma paludosum, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers with five petals. The plant has a milky sap, which is characteristic of the milkweed genus. Its flowers attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance. Hymenostemma paludosum thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies."
