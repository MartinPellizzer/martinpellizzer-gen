It features basal rosettes of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and have a rough texture. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves and stems are covered in fine, stiff hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides."
