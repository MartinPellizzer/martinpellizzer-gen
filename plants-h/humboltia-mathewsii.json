    "intro": "Humboltia mathewsii, commonly known as the San Diego thornapple, is a flowering plant native to California and Baja California. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its spiny stems and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Humboltia mathewsii thrives in coastal scrub habitats and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important species for ecological studies in its native range."
