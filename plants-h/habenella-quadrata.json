    "intro": "Habenella quadrata, commonly known as the four-square liverwort, is a small, mat-forming plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive quadrilateral leaf structure, which gives it its scientific name. This species typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually green or reddish in color and lack true roots, relying instead on rhizoids for anchorage. Habenella quadrata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
