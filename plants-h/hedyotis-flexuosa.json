    "intro": "Hedyotis flexuosa, commonly known as the zigzag or false pennywort, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, opposite, oval-shaped leaves that often have a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year in some regions. Hedyotis flexuosa is adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in rainforest understoreys. Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it an effective ground cover plant in suitable habitats."
