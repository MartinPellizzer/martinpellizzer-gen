    "intro": "Hapaloceras arupa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a rare and endangered tree species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its dense, dark red heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it particularly vulnerable to deforestation. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, while its flowers are small and greenish-white. Due to habitat loss and overexploitation, Hapaloceras arupa is critically endangered, prompting conservation efforts to protect this unique botanical species."
