It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and meadows, and it thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its striking blue to purple flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
