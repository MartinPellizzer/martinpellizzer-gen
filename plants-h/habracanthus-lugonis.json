It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night. The plant has a woody stem with tendrils that help it climb towards light. Its flowers emit a strong, sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. The leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often have a velvety texture."
