    "intro": "Helianthemum montanum var. obovatum, commonly known as the mountain carnation, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has compact, fleshy leaves that are obovate in shape, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for cultivation in Mediterranean climates."
