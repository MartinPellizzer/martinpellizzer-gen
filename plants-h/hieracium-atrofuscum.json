    "intro": "Hieracium atrofuscum, commonly known as black-centred hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its dark purple to black central flower head, which contrasts with its yellow ray florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are hairy and often reddish in color. Hieracium atrofuscum is often considered a weed but can provide nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
