    "intro": "Hudsonia ericoides, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It typically features small, leathery leaves that are densely packed, providing a dense, mat-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure. Hudsonia ericoides is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
