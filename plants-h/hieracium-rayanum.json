    "intro": "Hieracium rayanum, commonly known as the Rayanum hawkweed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in meadows and grassy areas. The plant has basal and stem leaves that are hairy and lance-shaped, with a rough texture. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster, typical of the dandelion family. It is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators in its native habitats."
