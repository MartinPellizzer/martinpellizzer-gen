    "intro": "Hieracium glaucum subsp. chiamuerae, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellowish to orange flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes, where it tolerates cold and poor soil conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller flower heads and more compact growth form compared to other members of the Hieracium genus."
