It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its waxy, dark green leaves and clusters of star-shaped, pale pink to white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is often used in traditional medicine. Hoya tsangii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and ease of care make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
