    "intro": "Hohenbergia pabstii, commonly known as the Pabst's hohenbergia, is a species of flowering plant in the bromeliad family. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming structure with thick, fleshy leaves. The leaves are typically dark green with a waxy coating, which helps the plant retain moisture in its natural habitat. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale pink, emerging from the center of the rosette. This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and attractive appearance."
