    "intro": "Hieracium oligodon subsp. obristii, commonly known as the Alpine Hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its subspecies status reflects its distinct morphological and genetic traits compared to other members of the Hieracium genus. Due to its specialized habitat, it is often found in mountainous areas such as the Alps and Carpathians."
