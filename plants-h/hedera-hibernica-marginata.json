    "intro": "Hedera hibernica marginata, commonly known as the Irish ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to Ireland. It features dark green, lobed leaves with a distinctive white or pale margin, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, followed by dark blue berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stone walls. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
