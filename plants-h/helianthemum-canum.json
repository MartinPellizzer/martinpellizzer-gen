    "intro": "Helianthemum canum, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
