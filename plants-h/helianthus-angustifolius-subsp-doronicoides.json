    "intro": "Helianthus angustifolius subsp. doronicoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sunflower, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems and vibrant yellow ray flowers surrounding a central disk of smaller florets. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. It plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native habitat."
