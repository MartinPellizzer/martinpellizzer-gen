    "intro": "Hieracium bourgaei subsp. sclerophyllum, commonly known as the hard-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, rigid leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a single head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as slopes and grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is relatively drought-tolerant and can withstand harsh environmental conditions."
