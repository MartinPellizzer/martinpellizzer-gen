    "intro": "Hordeum strictum, commonly known as slender barley, is a grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, erect stems and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Its leaves are linear and often have a rough texture, while its seeds are small and wind-dispersed. Hordeum strictum is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings but also has ecological value in supporting pollinators."
