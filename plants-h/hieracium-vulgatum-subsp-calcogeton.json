    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. calcogeton, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring moist and nutrient-rich soils. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate leaves and produces yellow flowers in a composite head, characteristic of the Asteraceae family. Its flowering period occurs from late spring to early autumn, and it is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes and seeds. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly larger leaves and more robust growth compared to other Hieracium species."
