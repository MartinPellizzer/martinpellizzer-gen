    "intro": "Holopyxidium retusum, commonly known as the roughleaf holopyxidium, is a small flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within its native range."
