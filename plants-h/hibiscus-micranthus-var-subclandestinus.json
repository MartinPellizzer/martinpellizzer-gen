    "intro": "Hibiscus micranthus var. subclandestinus, commonly known as the hidden hibiscus, is a lesser-known variant of the hibiscus genus. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate to bright light conditions. It is native to certain regions of Africa, where it grows in humid, tropical environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is not commonly cultivated outside its native range."
