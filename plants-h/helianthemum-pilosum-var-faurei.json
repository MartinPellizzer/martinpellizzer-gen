    "intro": "Helianthemum pilosum var. faurei, commonly known as the woolly rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, silvery-gray foliage covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
