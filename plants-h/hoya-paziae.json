    "intro": "Hoya paziae, commonly known as the \"Coral Hoya,\" is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and pink. The plant produces clusters of small, waxy flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in spring or early summer. Hoya paziae prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance make it a favored ornamental plant among horticulturists."
