    "intro": "Hordeum bulbosum, commonly known as bulbous barley, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and compact, bulbous base that stores nutrients for regrowth. The plant produces spikelets that bear small, two-lobed flowers, typically green to reddish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Hordeum bulbosum is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
