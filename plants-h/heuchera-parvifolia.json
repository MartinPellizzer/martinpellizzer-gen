    "intro": "Heuchera parvifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf alumroot, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped, dark green foliage that is often adorned with a distinctive red or purple margin. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring, which are clustered in upright panicles. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Heuchera parvifolia is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and ability to naturalize in woodland settings."
