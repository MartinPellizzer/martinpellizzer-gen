    "intro": "Hieracium flettii, commonly known as Flett's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hieracium flettii is considered a rare and endangered species."
