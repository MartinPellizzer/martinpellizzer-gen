    "intro": "Hydrocotyle quinqueradiata, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically light to dark green, with a glossy surface and a distinctive arrowhead shape. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for water gardens and bog landscapes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, forming dense colonies that help stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
