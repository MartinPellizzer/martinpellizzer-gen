    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracesium remanentiforme, commonly known as the remnant-like hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to temperate regions of Europe, it thrives in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in some habitats. Its botanical features make it adaptable to various environmental conditions, though it is less common in modern botanical collections."
