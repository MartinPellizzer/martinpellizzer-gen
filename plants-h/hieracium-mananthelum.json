    "intro": "Hieracium mananthelum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and it produces small, elongated seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium mananthelum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit and ability to colonize new areas quickly."
