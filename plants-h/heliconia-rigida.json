    "intro": "Heliconia rigida, commonly known as the red heliconia, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces inflorescences that are often used in floral arrangements due to their vibrant hues and unique shape. Heliconia rigida thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including birds and insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitats."
