    "intro": "Hemicardion subhastatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hemicarpium, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescence. It is a herbaceous perennial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbrella-like clusters, which attract various pollinators. The fruit is a dry, two-lobed schizocarp, typical of the Apiaceae family, and contains two mericarps that separate at maturity."
