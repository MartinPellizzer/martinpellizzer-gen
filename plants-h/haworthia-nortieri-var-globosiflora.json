    "intro": "Haworthia nortieri var. globosiflora, commonly known as the globular haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features dense, fleshy rosettes of light green to bluish-gray leaves with white to pale yellow tubercles. The plant produces small, star-shaped white flowers on tall, slender stems during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor and rock garden settings."
