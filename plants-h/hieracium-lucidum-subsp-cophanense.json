It typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features upright stems with alternate, broadly lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow, with a distinctive involucral bract, and it produces small, oval seeds in a schizocarp. It is characterized by its glossy, waxy leaves that give it its common name."
