    "intro": "Hosta lancifolia f. subchrocea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hosta, is a cultivar characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often a striking shade of chartreuse. This variety thrives in partial to full shade, making it ideal for woodland gardens or shaded borders. The foliage tends to be more compact compared to other hosta varieties, with a dense, upright growth habit. It produces small, fragrant flowers in late summer, though these are less showy than the foliage. The plant is relatively low maintenance, preferring moist, well-drained soil and moderate to cool temperatures."
