It features dense, velvety foliage with soft, hairy textures that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often clustered at the base, while its flowering stems rise above the foliage.
