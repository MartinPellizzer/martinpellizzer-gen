It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming throughout the warm seasons. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in tropical and subtropical regions."
