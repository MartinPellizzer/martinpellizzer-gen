    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 subglabratum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a hybrid plant species within the genus Hieracium, which belongs to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its composite flower heads, consisting of both ray and disk flowers, typical of the daisy family. The plant typically grows in meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight. It has basal leaves that are hairy and lance-shaped, with stems that are also covered in fine hairs. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits variability in morphology, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
