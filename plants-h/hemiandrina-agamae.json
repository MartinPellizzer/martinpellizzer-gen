    "intro": "Hemiandrina agamae, commonly known as the African rock orchid, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and specialized adaptations to rocky environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange, with a unique structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. Hemiandrina agamae thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on exposed rock faces or in crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
