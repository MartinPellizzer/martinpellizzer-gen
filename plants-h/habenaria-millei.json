    "intro": "Habenaria millei, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and long, spirally arranged inflorescences that bear numerous small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories and is adapted to humid, tropical climates. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
