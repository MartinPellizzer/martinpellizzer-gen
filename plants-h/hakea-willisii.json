    "intro": "Hakea willisii, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems and needle-like leaves that are often covered in a white waxy coating. The plant produces distinctive red or orange flowers in winter, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. It is adapted to coastal environments and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for sandy soils. Hakea willisii plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
