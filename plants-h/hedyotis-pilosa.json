    "intro": "Hedyotis pilosa, commonly known as the hairy knotweed, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It features small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are covered in fine, hairy glands. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in some habitats. Botanically, it is characterized by its distinctive hairy foliage and its ability to thrive in humid, temperate climates."
