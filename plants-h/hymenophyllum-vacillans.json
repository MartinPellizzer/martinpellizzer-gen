    "intro": "Hymenophyllum vacillans, commonly known as the trembling fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the Hymenophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, moss-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This epiphytic plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks and rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually bright green and have a velvety texture, which helps in retaining moisture. The spore-producing structures, or sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Hymenophyllaceae family."
