    "intro": "Hedera cochleata, commonly known as the spiral ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to the Mediterranean region. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that have a distinctive spiral pattern on the petioles. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Hedera cochleata is also valued for its ability to climb and cover walls or trellises effectively."
