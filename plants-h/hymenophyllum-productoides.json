    "intro": "Hymenophyllum productoides, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and Australia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Hymenophyllum productoides is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums."
