    "intro": "Hoarea selinifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a rosette of silvery-gray, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, dense hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Hoarea selinifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate harsh climatic conditions."
