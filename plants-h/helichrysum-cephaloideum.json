    "intro": "Helichrysum cephaloideum, commonly known as the Cape golden bush, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers that are often mistaken for dried flowers due to their papery texture. The plant has aromatic, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to retain color after flowering makes it a valuable ornamental plant in both garden and floral arrangements."
