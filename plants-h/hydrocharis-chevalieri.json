    "intro": "Hydrocharis chevalieri, commonly known as the water shield, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with roots submerged in the water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, often in clusters. It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Hydrocharis chevalieri plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
