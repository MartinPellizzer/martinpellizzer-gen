It is characterized by its distinctive morphology, featuring a short, woody stem and clusters of small, spiny leaves. The plant produces yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a striking visual element to its habitat. Its growth is closely tied to the chemical composition of its environment, particularly the presence of aluminum compounds. Due to its specialized requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
