    "intro": "Haynaldia hordeacea var. breviaristata, commonly known as the short-awned barleygrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant is characterized by its short awns, which are bristle-like structures at the tips of its florets. It typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along streambanks. This variant is closely related to cultivated barley and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
