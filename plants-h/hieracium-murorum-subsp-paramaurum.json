    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. paramaurum, commonly known as the coastal hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Europe. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in dunes or along the edges of beaches. The plant features bright yellow flowers arranged in a single head, with ray florets that are often shorter than the central disk. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This subspecies is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds, making it a resilient component of maritime ecosystems."
