It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its large, compound leaves and showy yellow flowers. The tree produces heavy, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. It also has a long history of use in traditional medicine and as a source of dye. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
