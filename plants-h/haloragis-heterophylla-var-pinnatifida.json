    "intro": "Haloragis heterophylla var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved waterwheel, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, opposite, pinnately divided leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands. It produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in whorls along the stems, and it is often used in ornamental water gardens. Haloragis heterophylla var. pinnatifida is valued for its ability to provide habitat for aquatic invertebrates and its aesthetic appeal in aquatic landscapes."
