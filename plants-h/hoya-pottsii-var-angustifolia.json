    "intro": "Hoya pottsii var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed wax plant, is a tropical species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its waxy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, often blooming during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among indoor gardeners for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
