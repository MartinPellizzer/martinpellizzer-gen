    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. rigidistolonum, commonly known as the rigid-stoloniferous hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands, wastelands, and along roadsides. The plant has a creeping growth habit, with rigid, often hairy stems that form dense mats. Its leaves are usually basal, lance-shaped, and covered with fine, stiff hairs. The flowers are yellow, clustered in heads, and are surrounded by pale green bracts, giving it a distinctive appearance."
