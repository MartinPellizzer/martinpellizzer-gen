    "intro": "Hydrocotyle venezuelensis, commonly known as the Venezuelan spurgeleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, palmate leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. It produces small, white flowers arranged in umbels, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. Hydrocotyle venezuelensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
