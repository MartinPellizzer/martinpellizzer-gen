    "intro": "Hieracium submacropterum, commonly known as the narrow-winged hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosettes of broadly ovate, serrated leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
