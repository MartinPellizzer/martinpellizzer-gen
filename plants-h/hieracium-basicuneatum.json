    "intro": "Hieracium basicuneatum, commonly known as the rough hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are rough and hairy, with a serrated edge, and its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. Hieracium basicuneatum is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
