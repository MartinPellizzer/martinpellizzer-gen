    "intro": "Hieracium amplisissimum, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and can form dense colonies due to its aggressive growth habit. However, it is considered invasive in some regions, outcompeting native flora and altering local ecosystems."
