    "intro": "Haworthia mirabilis var. notabilis, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to South Africa. It features striking, dark green leaves with white to pale yellow markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces tall, slender flower stalks with small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and rock gardens."
