    "intro": "Humata tenuis, commonly known as the slender humata, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded understory environments of rainforests. Due to habitat loss, Humata tenuis is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
