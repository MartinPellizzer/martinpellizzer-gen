    "intro": "Halacsyella parnassica, commonly known as the Parnassian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
