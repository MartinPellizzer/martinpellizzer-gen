    "intro": "Habenaria leibergii, commonly known as the Leiberg's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often near streams or in rocky areas. The plant produces slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves and bears small, pale pink to white flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate floral structure and specialized pollination mechanisms. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
