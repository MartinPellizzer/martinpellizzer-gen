    "intro": "Heliamphora minor var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy sun pitcher, is a carnivorous plant native to the tepuis of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and large, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky liquid to trap insects. The plant's leaves are covered in dense, hairy trichomes, which give it its common name and aid in water retention. It thrives in humid, nutrient-poor environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. This variant is particularly notable for its striking appearance and specialized adaptations for nutrient acquisition."
