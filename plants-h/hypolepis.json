    "intro": "Hypolepis, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and wetlands. Hypolepis species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, and they play a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms. Their reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and contain spores for propagation."
