    "intro": "Heterostemma stellatum, commonly known as the star-leaf vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that often have a star-like pattern on the underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its propagation. Heterostemma stellatum is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests."
