    "intro": "Hesperochiron pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf milkweed, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, narrow leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is typical of the genus, which can be toxic to some animals. Hesperochiron pumilus thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its floral structure includes specialized structures called corona, which aid in pollination by specific insects."
