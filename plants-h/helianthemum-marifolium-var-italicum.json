    "intro": "Helianthemum marifolium var. italicum, commonly known as the Italian rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained, sunny soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
