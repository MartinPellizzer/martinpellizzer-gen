It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The flowers are small and yellow, often appearing in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value."
