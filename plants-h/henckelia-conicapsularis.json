    "intro": "Henckelia conicapsularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved henckelia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in the Andean regions of Ecuador and Peru. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family, characterized by its bell-shaped flowers. The plant is typically shrub-like, with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in spring. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study due to its adaptation to high-altitude environments."
