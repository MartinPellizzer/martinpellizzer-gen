It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and rocky soils. The plant features bright yellow composite flowers that are clustered in a head, with bracts forming a distinctive involucral structure. Its leaves are usually basal, with a rough, hairy texture and a bluish-green hue. The species is characterized by its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
