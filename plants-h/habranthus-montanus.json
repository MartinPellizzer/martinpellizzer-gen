    "intro": "Habranthus montanus, commonly known as the mountain habranthus, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in regions of Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue. The plant produces a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and blooms during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated by gardeners interested in native plants."
