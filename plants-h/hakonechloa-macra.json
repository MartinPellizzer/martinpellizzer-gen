    "intro": "Hakonechloa macra, commonly known as Japanese forest grass, is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in shady, moist environments. It features fine, arching foliage with a pale green to golden hue, often tinged with red or bronze in the fall. The plant produces delicate, spikelike inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well-suited for woodland gardens and can be used as a ground cover or in rock gardens. Hakonechloa macra is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate partial shade."
