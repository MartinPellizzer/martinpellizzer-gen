    "intro": "Hieracium chlorifolium subsp. rendinaricum, commonly known as the Corsican hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late spring to early summer. Its subspecies status reflects distinct morphological characteristics that set it apart from other members of the Hieracium genus. It is often found in isolated populations, contributing to its rarity and ecological significance."
