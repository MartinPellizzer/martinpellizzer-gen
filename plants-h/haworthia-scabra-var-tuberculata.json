    "intro": "Haworthia scabra var. tuberculata, commonly known as the tuberculate Haworthia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features dense rosettes of fleshy, triangular leaves covered in small, raised tubercles that give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically pale green to bluish-green, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers on slender stems during the spring or summer. This variety is prized for its unique texture and ability to thrive in well-draining soil with minimal water."
