    "intro": "Hygrophila angolensis, commonly known as the Angola waterweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a semi-aquatic species that thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of slow-moving water bodies. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Hygrophila angolensis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
