    "intro": "Helleborus thalictroides, commonly known as the yellow hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features dark green, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with five petals, resembling those of the buttercup, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
