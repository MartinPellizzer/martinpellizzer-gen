    "intro": "Henriettea odorata, commonly known as the sweet-scented fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that emit a subtle, fragrant aroma. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its unique scent is attributed to the presence of volatile organic compounds in its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Henriettea odorata is considered an endangered species."
