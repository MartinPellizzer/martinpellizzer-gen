    "intro": "Hartogia ericoides, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Western Australia. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and clusters of pink to white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of coastal environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
