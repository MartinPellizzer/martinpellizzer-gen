    "intro": "Hordeum vulgare var. pallidum, commonly known as pale barley, is a variant of the domesticated barley species. It is characterized by its lighter-colored grains compared to standard barley varieties. The plant typically grows in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its grains, which are used in food and animal feed. It has a compact growth habit with slender stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The botanical features of this variety make it distinct in both agricultural and ecological contexts."
