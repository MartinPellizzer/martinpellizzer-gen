    "intro": "Heracleum sosnowskyi, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a tall, invasive plant native to Eastern Europe and parts of Asia. It can grow up to 5 meters in height, with large, umbrella-like compound leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant contains phototoxic sap that can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils along rivers and roadsides. Due to its aggressive growth and harmful effects, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
