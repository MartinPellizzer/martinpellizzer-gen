    "intro": "Halosciastrum melanotilingia, commonly known as the black-tongued sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb with narrow, gray-green leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture in dry soils. Halosciastrum melanotilingia is well-suited to harsh, sandy environments and is often found in coastal and inland dune areas."
