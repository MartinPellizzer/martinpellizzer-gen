    "intro": "Haemanthus sarniensis, commonly known as the Natal grassbladder, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, grass-like leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a dense inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
