It is characterized by its striking, large, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red, often with a contrasting white throat. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. Its stems are typically woody and covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. Hibiscus sturtii var. typicus is well adapted to drought and can thrive in poor, sandy soils."
