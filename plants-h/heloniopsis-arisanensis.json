    "intro": "Heloniopsis arisanensis, commonly known as the Arisan bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in mountainous regions. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
