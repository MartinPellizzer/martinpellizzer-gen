    "intro": "Hydnora africana, commonly known as the devil's tongue, is a parasitic plant found primarily in the succulent karoo region of South Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of species like Asclepiadaceae. The plant produces a distinctive, fleshy, reddish flower that emits a strong, sweet odor to attract pollinators such as flies. Its unique structure includes a central column with a hollow, tubular shape that houses the reproductive organs. Due to its specialized biology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
