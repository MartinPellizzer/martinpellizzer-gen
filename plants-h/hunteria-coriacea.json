    "intro": "Hunteria coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved hunteria, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in small, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
