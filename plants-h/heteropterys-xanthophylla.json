    "intro": "Heteropterys xanthophylla, commonly known as the golden leaf tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow to orange leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a sweet scent that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. The bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
