    "intro": "Hartogia collina, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing herb with a mat-forming habit, often found in sandy or rocky coastal areas. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy white seeds for wind dispersal. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Hartogia collina is adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
