    "intro": "Heliamphora macdonaldae, commonly known as the Macdonald's sun pitcher, is a unique carnivorous plant native to Venezuela. It belongs to the Sarraceniaceae family and is characterized by its pitcher-shaped leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant's pitchers are typically red or orange, with a waxy coating that aids in insect attraction. It thrives in wet, nutrient-poor environments, often found in bogs or marshes. Heliamphora macdonaldae is notable for its specialized adaptations that allow it to supplement its nutrient intake through insect prey."
