    "intro": "Hieracium leiopogon subsp. coquozianum, commonly known as the Alpine Groundsel, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or grassy slopes at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flower heads that bloom in late summer. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in association with other alpine flora. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in certain mountain ranges."
