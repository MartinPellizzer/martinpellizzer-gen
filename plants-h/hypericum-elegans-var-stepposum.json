    "intro": "Hypericum elegans var. stepposum, commonly known as the steppe St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically features wiry stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has elliptical, glossy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its medicinal properties, though less studied than other Hypericum species, have been traditionally used in herbal remedies."
