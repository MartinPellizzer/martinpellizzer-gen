    "intro": "Helianthemum polifolium, commonly known as the many-leaved sunflower, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, rounded foliage with densely packed, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
