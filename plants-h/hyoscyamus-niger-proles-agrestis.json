It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and alternate, ovate leaves. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or violet in color. Its berries are toxic and contain tropane alkaloids, which have been historically used in medicine and as a poison. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
