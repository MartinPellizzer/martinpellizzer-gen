    "intro": "Habenaria psycodes var. varians, commonly known as the variable ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, growing on trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from its host. Its flowers are typically small, with three petals and three sepals, and it produces a unique, fragrant odor to attract pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation programs."
