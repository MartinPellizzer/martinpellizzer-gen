    "intro": "Hedera cordifolia, commonly known as the heart-leaf ivy, is a species of climbing plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Hedera cordifolia thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. It is also valued for its ability to climb and cover surfaces, making it a popular choice for vertical gardening."
