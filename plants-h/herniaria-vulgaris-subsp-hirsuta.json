    "intro": "Herniaria vulgaris subsp. hirsuta, commonly known as hairy herniaria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or coastal habitats. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
