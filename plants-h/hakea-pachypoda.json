    "intro": "Hakea pachypoda, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and distinctive, cylindrical flower spikes that bloom in winter. The plant has adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden environments, making it highly resilient to coastal conditions. Its root system is deep and extensive, helping it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Hakea pachypoda plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for native wildlife."
