    "intro": "Hieracium sarmaticum, commonly known as the Sarmatian hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with ray florets. Hieracium sarmaticum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit and ability to colonize various environments."
