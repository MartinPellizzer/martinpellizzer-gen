    "intro": "Hieracium lagerbergii, commonly known as the Lagerberg's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
