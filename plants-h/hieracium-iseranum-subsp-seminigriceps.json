    "intro": "Hieracium iseranum subsp. seminigriceps, commonly known as the dark-headed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a single head, with ray florets that are often darker in color than those of other hawkweed species. It thrives in dry meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
