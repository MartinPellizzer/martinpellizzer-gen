    "intro": "Habenaria undatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, preferring shaded environments with moist soil. Its roots are often colonized by mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The species is notable for its delicate appearance and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
