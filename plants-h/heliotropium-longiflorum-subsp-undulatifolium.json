    "intro": "Heliotropium longiflorum subsp. undulatifolium, commonly known as the undulate-leaved heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite, undulating leaves that give it its subspecies name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, resembling those of the common heliotrope. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or near waterways. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
