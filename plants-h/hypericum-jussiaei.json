    "intro": "Hypericum jussiaei, commonly known as the Jussiaei St. John's Wort, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically from June to August. The plant has opposite, simple, and often glandular-studded leaves that are usually oval to elliptic in shape. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in meadows and woodland edges. Its medicinal properties have been studied, though it is less widely used than other Hypericum species."
