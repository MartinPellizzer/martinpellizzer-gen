    "intro": "Helianthus tuberosus f. moldenkeanus, commonly known as the tuberous sunflower, is a botanical variant of the sunflower species characterized by its distinctive tuberous roots. This form exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to the typical sunflower, with shorter stems and smaller, more clustered leaves. The flowers are usually yellow with dark centers, similar to the common sunflower, but the plant is noted for its robust root system that produces edible tubers. It is native to the eastern United States and is often cultivated for both ornamental and culinary purposes. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it adaptable to a variety of garden conditions."
