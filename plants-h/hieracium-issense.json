    "intro": "Hieracium issense, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its bright yellow daisy-like flowers and hairy, lobed leaves. Native to Europe, it thrives in moist, disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows and along roadsides. The plant produces numerous small seeds that are dispersed by the wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
