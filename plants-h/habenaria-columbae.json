    "intro": "Habenaria columbae, commonly known as the Columbae orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, often with a faintly fragrant scent. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
