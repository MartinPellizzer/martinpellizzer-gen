    "intro": "Hieracium leiosoma subsp. ravinense, commonly known as the rock hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. It is often found in subalpine and alpine meadows, where it forms dense colonies. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in its native range."
