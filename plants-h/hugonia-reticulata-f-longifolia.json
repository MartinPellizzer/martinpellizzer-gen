    "intro": "Hugonia reticulata f. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved reticulate hugonia, is a striking perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist, shaded environments. This variety is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
