    "intro": "Hieraciodes kitaibelii, commonly known as the Kitaibel's cinquefoil, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its creeping growth habit and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
