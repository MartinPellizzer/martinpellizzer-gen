    "intro": "Hypodematium fauriei f. glandulosopilosum, commonly known as the glandular-pilose hypodematium, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Ericaceae. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and bears small, leathery leaves that are densely covered with glandular and pilose (hairy) structures. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in montane or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
