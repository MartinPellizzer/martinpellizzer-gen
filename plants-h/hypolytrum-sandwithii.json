    "intro": "Hypolytrum sandwithii, commonly known as the Sandwith's sedge, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in dune environments where it is adapted to withstand saline and arid conditions. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
