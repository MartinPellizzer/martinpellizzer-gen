    "intro": "Henrya rupicola, commonly known as the rock henrya, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the rocky habitats of Japan. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a prized plant among horticulturists and garden enthusiasts."
