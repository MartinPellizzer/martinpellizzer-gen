    "intro": "Hymenophyllum sodiroi, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, moss-like fronds covered in a fine, silky layer of trichomes, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Hymenophyllum sodiroi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
