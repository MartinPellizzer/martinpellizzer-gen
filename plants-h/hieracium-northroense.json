    "intro": "Hieracium northroense, commonly known as the northern hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. It produces yellow flowers with a central disc, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped with rough, hairy surfaces. Hieracium northroense is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth habits."
