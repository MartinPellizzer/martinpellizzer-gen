    "intro": "Hieracium pseudorubrum, commonly known as the false hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, preferring moist and well-drained conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough, hairy texture, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium pseudorubrum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain habitats."
