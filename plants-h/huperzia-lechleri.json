    "intro": "Huperzia lechleri, commonly known as the Andean clubmoss, is a member of the Huperziaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a distinctive rosette-shaped structure with spirally arranged leaves that are often covered in fine scales. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the leaves. Huperzia lechleri is noted for its slow growth and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
