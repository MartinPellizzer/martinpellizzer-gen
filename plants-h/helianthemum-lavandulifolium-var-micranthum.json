    "intro": "Helianthemum lavandulifolium var. micranthum, commonly known as the narrow-flowered rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. The leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in sunny, well-drained environments. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
