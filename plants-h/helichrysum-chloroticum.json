    "intro": "Helichrysum chloroticum, commonly known as the yellow everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers that resemble daisies. The plant produces fluffy, seed-filled spheres that are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its botanical name reflects its chlorotic (yellow) appearance and its tendency to remain green and vibrant throughout the growing season."
