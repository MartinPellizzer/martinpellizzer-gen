    "intro": "Hymenophyllum longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaf shield fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a dense, compact growth habit and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its leaves are covered with a fine layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss and protect it from desiccation. This species is widely distributed across tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Asia, Africa, and the Americas."
