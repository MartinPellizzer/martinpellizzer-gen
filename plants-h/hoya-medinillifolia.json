    "intro": "Hoya medinillifolia, commonly known as the \"Coral Hoya,\" is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its waxy, ovate leaves that are typically green with a subtle reddish or pinkish hue. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Hoya medinillifolia thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
