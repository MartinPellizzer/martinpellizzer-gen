    "intro": "Hariota cassytha, commonly known as the golden creeper, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, opposite leaves that are usually ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, round berries that are edible. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Hariota cassytha is also known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, which can make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed."
