    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed hawkweed, is a hybrid plant in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its upright growth habit and is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. The plant produces showy yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Hieracium \u00d7 longipes is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
