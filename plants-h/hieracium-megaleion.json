It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features broad, serrated leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in some regions."
