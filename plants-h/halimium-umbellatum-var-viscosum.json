    "intro": "Halimium umbellatum var. viscosum, commonly known as sticky rockrose, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its succulent, hairy leaves and showy, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Its sticky secretions on the leaves and stems help reduce water loss, making it well adapted to arid environments. This variety is closely related to other members of the Cistaceae family, sharing similar ecological and morphological traits."
