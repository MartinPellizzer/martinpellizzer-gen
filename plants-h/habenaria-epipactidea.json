    "intro": "Habenaria epipactidea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in wet, marshy habitats and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has a complex root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soils in which it thrives. Its flowers are usually arranged in a spike and are pollinated by insects, particularly bees. The species is known for its resilience and ability to survive in fluctuating water levels."
