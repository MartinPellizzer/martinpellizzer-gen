    "intro": "Hybanthus velutinus, commonly known as the velvetleaf hybanthus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is a member of the Bindweed family (Convolvulaceae) and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a distinctive pattern of veins. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it its common name. Hybanthus velutinus is often found in disturbed habitats and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas."
