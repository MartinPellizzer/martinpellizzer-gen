    "intro": "Hypericum monroi, commonly known as the creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, woody stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, with a slightly rough texture. Hypericum monroi is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
