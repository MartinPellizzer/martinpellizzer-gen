    "intro": "Hypericum asperulum, commonly known as rough St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture, which gives it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or woodland areas. Hypericum asperulum is known for its medicinal properties, though it contains compounds that can be toxic if ingested in large quantities."
