    "intro": "Heteropterys rubiginosa f. typica, commonly known as the red-stemmed beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible for some animals but generally unpalatable to humans. Its leaves are ovate with a slightly serrated margin, and the stems are prominently covered in red or purple hairs. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant floral display and unique fruiting characteristics."
