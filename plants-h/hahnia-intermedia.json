    "intro": "Hahnia intermedia, commonly known as the common hahnia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters and features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in loose clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly rough texture. Hahnia intermedia is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained, loamy soils."
