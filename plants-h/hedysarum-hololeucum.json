    "intro": "Hedysarum hololeucum, commonly known as the white vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces cylindrical pods that contain several small, round seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Hedysarum hololeucum plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
