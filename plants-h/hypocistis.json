    "intro": "Hypocistis, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Melanthiaceae. These plants are characterized by their perennial growth habit and their ability to thrive in woodland environments. The leaves are typically basal, forming a rosette, and are often lance-shaped with a waxy texture. Hypocistis species produce small, greenish flowers that are clustered in umbels, and they are known for their toxic properties. Due to their medicinal and poisonous qualities, they have been historically used in traditional medicine and as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
