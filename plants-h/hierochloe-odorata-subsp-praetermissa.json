    "intro": "Hierochloe odorata subsp. praetermissa, commonly known as sweet vernalgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that bear small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that are often mistaken for grasses due to their similar appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
