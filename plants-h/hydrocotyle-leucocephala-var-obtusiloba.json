    "intro": "Hydrocotyle leucocephala var. obtusiloba, commonly known as the white-headed water shield, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer and early fall. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in muddy or aquatic environments. This variant is distinguished by its rounded leaf lobes, which set it apart from other varieties within the Hydrocotyle genus."
