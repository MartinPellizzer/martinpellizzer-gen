    "intro": "Hieracium cottianum var. subpanduratum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. Its leaves are often deeply lobed and have a distinctive reddish or purple coloration on the underside. This variety is known for its hirsute appearance and is often found in high-altitude environments."
