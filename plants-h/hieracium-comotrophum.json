It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant features yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and its leaves are usually hairy and lance-shaped. It is adapted to salty and windy conditions, making it a hardy species found in maritime environments. Hieracium comotrophum plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
