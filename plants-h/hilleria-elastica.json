    "intro": "Hilleria elastica, commonly known as the rubber plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often dark green with a slightly variegated appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is well adapted to humid environments and thrives in partial to full shade. Due to its rubbery texture, it is sometimes cultivated for its unique physical properties and ornamental value."
