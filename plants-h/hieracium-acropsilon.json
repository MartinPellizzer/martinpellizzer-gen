    "intro": "Hieracium acropsilon, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry environments. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in meadows and grasslands. Its botanical structure supports its role as a pioneer species in disturbed habitats."
