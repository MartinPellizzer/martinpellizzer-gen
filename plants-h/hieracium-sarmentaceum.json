It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with creeping stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that are typically clustered in a single head. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats."
