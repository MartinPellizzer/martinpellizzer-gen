    "intro": "Holcus lanatus var. argenteus, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a variant of the common hairgrass species. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which results from dense, fine hairs covering the leaves. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, greenish flowers. The silver hairgrass is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
