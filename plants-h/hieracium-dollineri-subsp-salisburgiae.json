    "intro": "Hieracium dollineri subsp. salisburgiae, commonly known as the Salzburg Hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming basal leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun. Its small, daisy-like flowers are followed by fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
