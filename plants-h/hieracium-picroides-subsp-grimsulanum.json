    "intro": "Hieracium picroides subsp. grimsulanum, commonly known as the Grimsul sand-agaric, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. This subspecies is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its specific ecological requirements and limited distribution."
