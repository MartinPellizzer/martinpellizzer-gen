    "intro": "Heliophila patens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, sunny environments such as meadows and wetlands. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are usually blue or purple, and they bloom in late spring to early summer. Heliophila patens is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
