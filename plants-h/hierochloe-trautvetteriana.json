It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture, and it is often found in high-altitude meadows. Hierochloe trautvetteriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain."
