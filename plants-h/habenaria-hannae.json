    "intro": "Habenaria hannae, commonly known as the Malagasy marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and linear, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
