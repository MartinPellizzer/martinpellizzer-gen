It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with delicate, white to pale pink petals. Hemipilia tetraloba is often found in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its woodland habitat, making it a unique member of the orchid family."
