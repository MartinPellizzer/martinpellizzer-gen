    "intro": "Haplopappus phyllocephalus subsp. megacephalus, commonly known as the giant pappus dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves and a tall, unbranched stem that produces a single, large flower head. The flower head consists of numerous small, yellow ray florets surrounded by a pappus of bristles, which aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in open areas with well-drained soils. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh conditions with deep taproots and a dormant phase during dry periods."
