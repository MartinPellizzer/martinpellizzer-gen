    "intro": "Habenaria sparsiflora var. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland and swampy habitats in Southeast Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant is characterized by its short, compact inflorescence and is adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are often pollinated by specific insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native environment. The species is relatively rare and requires careful conservation due to habitat degradation."
