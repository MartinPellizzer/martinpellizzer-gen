    "intro": "Hoeffnagelia, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plants typically have thick, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to conserve water, making them well-suited for harsh desert environments. Hoeffnagelia species are often shrubs or small trees, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. Their flowers bloom during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds."
