    "intro": "Hieracium sparsifolium var. oligodon, commonly known as the sparse-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and ray florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and arranged alternately along the stem, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. The flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, contributing to its role in supporting pollinators."
