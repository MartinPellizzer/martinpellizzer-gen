    "intro": "Hieracium caesioides subsp. pallidinaevum, commonly known as the pale-flowered hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosettes of leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
