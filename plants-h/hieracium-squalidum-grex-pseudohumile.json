    "intro": "Hieracium squalidum grex pseudohumile, commonly known as the squalid hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the dandelion family (Compositae). It is a low-growing perennial herb with hairy stems and basal leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which are followed by fluffy, white seed heads. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wetlands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
