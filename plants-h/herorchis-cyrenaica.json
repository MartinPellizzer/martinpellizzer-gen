    "intro": "Herorchis cyrenaica, commonly known as the Cyrenaica orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to North Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers and is typically found in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant has a short, hairy stem and produces small, clustered blooms during the spring season. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires specific environmental conditions to flourish. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
