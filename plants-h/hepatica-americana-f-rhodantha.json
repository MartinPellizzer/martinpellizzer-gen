    "intro": "Hepatica americana f. rhodantha, commonly known as the red-flowered hepatica, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep pink or red. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully expand, and prefers moist, wooded habitats. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant spreads through rhizomes and seeds. The f. rhodantha form is notable for its more vibrant floral display compared to the typical variety."
