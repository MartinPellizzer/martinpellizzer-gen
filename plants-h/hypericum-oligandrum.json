    "intro": "Hypericum oligandrum, commonly known as the lesser St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features slender, upright stems covered in small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value."
