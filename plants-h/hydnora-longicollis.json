    "intro": "Hydnora longicollis, commonly known as the long-necked hydnora, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Hydnoraceae. It lacks chlorophyll and is entirely dependent on its host for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of woody plants. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, reddish stem and its unique, umbrella-shaped inflorescence that emits a strong odor to attract pollinators. It is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its specialized biology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
