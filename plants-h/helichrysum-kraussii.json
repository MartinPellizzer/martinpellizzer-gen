It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces small, golden-yellow flowers that resemble tiny balls. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its foliage is aromatic, with a slight citrus scent, and it is often used in gardens for its ornamental value. Helichrysum kraussii is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
