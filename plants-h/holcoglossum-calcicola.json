    "intro": "Holcoglossum calcicola, commonly known as the limestone tongue orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to China. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, with elongated, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant thrives in calcareous soils, typically found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. It produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive lip that resembles a tongue, giving it its common name. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Holcoglossum calcicola is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
