    "intro": "Hippodamia insignis, commonly known as the golden shield ladybird, is a species of ladybug native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow body with distinctive red or orange markings. The plant it is associated with, though not a plant itself, is often found in habitats where its prey, such as aphids, are abundant. Its larvae are typically black with red or orange stripes, and they feed on soft-bodied insects. This ladybird plays an important role in biological control by preying on harmful pests in agricultural and garden settings."
