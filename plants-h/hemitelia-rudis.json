    "intro": "Hemitelia rudis, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to tolerate salty and windy conditions. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Hemitelia rudis is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline."
