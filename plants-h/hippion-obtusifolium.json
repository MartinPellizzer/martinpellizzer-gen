It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
