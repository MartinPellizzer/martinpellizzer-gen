    "intro": "Hedysarum nudum, commonly known as the naked vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by narrow, bean-like pods. Hedysarum nudum is adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy species with low water requirements. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
