    "intro": "Hakea prasina, commonly known as the silver hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces cylindrical, woody seed pods that remain on the plant for years, releasing seeds when disturbed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and sandy environments. Hakea prasina is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
