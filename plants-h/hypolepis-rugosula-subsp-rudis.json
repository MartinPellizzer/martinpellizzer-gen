    "intro": "Hypolepis rugosula subsp. rudis, commonly known as the rough shield fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically divided into a series of triangular pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the fern family. The subspecies rudis is distinguished by its coarser texture and more prominently veined leaves compared to other subspecies of Hypolepis rugosula."
