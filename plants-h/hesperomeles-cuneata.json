    "intro": "Hesperomeles cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huito, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its high-altitude habitat. Hesperomeles cuneata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
