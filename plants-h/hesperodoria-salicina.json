    "intro": "Hesperodoria salicina, commonly known as the coastal dune lichen, is a symbiotic composite organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in harsh coastal environments, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing sandy soils and preventing erosion. The plant forms a dense, crust-like growth that can withstand high salt exposure and strong winds. Its reproductive structures are microscopic, and it reproduces through the dispersal of spores carried by wind. Hesperodoria salicina is an important indicator species for assessing the health of coastal ecosystems."
