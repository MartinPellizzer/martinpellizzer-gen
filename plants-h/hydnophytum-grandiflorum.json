    "intro": "Hydnophytum grandiflorum, commonly known as the giant pitcher plant, is a unique epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, hollow, pitcher-shaped leaves that serve as traps for insects. The plant's structure allows it to absorb nutrients from trapped prey through specialized digestive enzymes. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees in tropical rainforests. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptations for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor environments."
