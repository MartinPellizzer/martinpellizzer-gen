    "intro": "Hibiscus savannorum, commonly known as the sand hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or coastal soils, often found in wetlands and along the edges of swamps. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, depending on the variety. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and can reach up to several feet in height. Hibiscus savannorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid, coastal environments."
