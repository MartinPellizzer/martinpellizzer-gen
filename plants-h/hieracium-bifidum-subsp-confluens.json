    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. confluens, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and along streambanks, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers are yellow and daisy-like, with ray florets that bloom in late spring to early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its clustered growth habit and the merging of leaf bases, giving it a unique appearance among other hawkweed species."
