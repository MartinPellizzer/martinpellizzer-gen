    "intro": "Hemizonia calyculata, commonly known as the golden globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that are opposite and often covered in fine, sticky hairs. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Hemizonia calyculata is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments."
