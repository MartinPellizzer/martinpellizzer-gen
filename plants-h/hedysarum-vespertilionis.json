    "intro": "Hedysarum vespertilionis, commonly known as the bat's wing or evening bat pea, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pea-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces cylindrical, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the legume family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
