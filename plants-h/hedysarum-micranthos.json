    "intro": "Hedysarum micranthos, commonly known as the small-flowered vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces slender, erect stems and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. It plays a role in soil stabilization due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Hedysarum micranthos is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
