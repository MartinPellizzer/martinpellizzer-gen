    "intro": "Hedysarum boreale var. utahense, commonly known as the Utah peavine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets and has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush communities. Hedysarum boreale var. utahense plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in arid environments."
