    "intro": "Hieracium melinomelas, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and ragweed, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its bright yellow flowers are surrounded by pale green ray florets, and it produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Hieracium melinomelas is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize various habitats."
