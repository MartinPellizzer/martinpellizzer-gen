    "intro": "Haplophyllophora acaulis var. brevipes, commonly known as the dwarf haircap moss, is a small, mat-forming moss that thrives in moist, acidic environments. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and short, upright stems covered in dense, overlapping leaves. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape and have a distinctive papillose (bumpy) surface. This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more robust stems compared to the typical form of Haplophyllophora acaulis. It is often found in forest floors, rock crevices, and shaded wetlands, contributing to soil stabilization and moisture retention."
