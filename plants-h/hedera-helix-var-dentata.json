    "intro": "Hedera helix var. dentata, commonly known as the serrated ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to Europe. It features dark green, lobed leaves with serrated edges, which give it its distinguishing appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Its vigorous growth habit makes it both a popular garden plant and a potential weed in certain areas."
