It features dense clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has gray-green, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in coastal or coastal-like conditions."
