    "intro": "Hedera viridis, commonly known as the common ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It features dark green, lobed leaves that are typically glossy and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by black, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. Hedera viridis thrives in shaded environments and is often found growing on walls, trees, and rocky surfaces. Its ability to climb and spread makes it both a popular ornamental plant and an invasive species in some regions."
