    "intro": "Hymenophyllum mazei, commonly known as the maze fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Hymenophyllum mazei is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
