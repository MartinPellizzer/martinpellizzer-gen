    "intro": "Hypecoum procumbens subsp. imberbe, commonly known as the creeping hellebore, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features basal rosettes of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers with five petals, which bloom in spring. Its root system consists of thick, fleshy rhizomes that store nutrients and help the plant survive dry periods. The species is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
