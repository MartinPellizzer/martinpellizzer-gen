It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
