It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its leaves are basal, rough, and sometimes hairy, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium stylosum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in disturbed soils."
