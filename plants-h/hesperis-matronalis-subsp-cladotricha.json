    "intro": "Hesperis matronalis subsp. cladotricha, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense, hairy foliage and the presence of clustered flower clusters at the ends of its stems. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders. This plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
