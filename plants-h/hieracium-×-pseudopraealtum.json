    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 pseudopraealtum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a hybrid plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and yellow flowering heads that consist of numerous small disk flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This species is native to Europe and has been introduced to other parts of the world, often becoming invasive in certain regions. Its botanical features make it a common weed in disturbed soils and agricultural fields."
