    "intro": "Hieracium divisum f. pinnatisectum, commonly known as the pinnatisected hawkweed, is a variant of the common hawkweed, characterized by its finely dissected, fern-like leaves. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is native to parts of Europe and western Asia. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. This form is distinguished by its more elaborate leaf division compared to the typical form of H. divisum."
