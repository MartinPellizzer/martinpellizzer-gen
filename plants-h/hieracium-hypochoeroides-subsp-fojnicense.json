    "intro": "Hieracium hypochoeroides subsp. fojnicense, commonly known as the Fojnina hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a single terminal head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
