    "intro": "Hyparrhenia djalonica, commonly known as African grass or red grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with dark green, narrow leaves and long, slender panicles of inflorescences. The plant is adapted to well-drained soils and can thrive in full sun, making it suitable for marginal lands. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Hyparrhenia djalonica is also valued for its use in traditional thatching and as a forage plant for livestock."
