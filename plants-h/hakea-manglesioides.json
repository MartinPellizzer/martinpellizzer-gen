    "intro": "Hakea manglesioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and produces cylindrical, red or pink flower spikes. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing drought tolerance through its succulent stems and reduced leaf surface. Its flowers attract nectar-feeding birds and insects, playing a role in local pollination networks. Hakea manglesioides is often found in coastal heathlands and sandy soils, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
