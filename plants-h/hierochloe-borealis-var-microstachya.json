It features fine, soft, silver-green foliage and produces delicate, feathery seed heads that are often white or pale yellow. The plant typically grows in open, rocky, or sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. It has small, narrow leaves and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. This variant is distinguished by its compact growth habit and unique floral structure compared to other members of the genus."
