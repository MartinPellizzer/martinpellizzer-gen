    "intro": "Hypolepis rugosula subsp. colorata, commonly known as the variegated shield fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, and often variegated fronds that display a mix of green, yellow, and white colors. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are pinnately compound, with serrated leaflets that contribute to its ornamental appeal."
