    "intro": "Heliconia titanum, commonly known as the giant heliconia, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, colorful inflorescences composed of long, fleshy bracts that resemble a bird's beak, hence its common name. The plant belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically orange or red, with a distinctive yellow throat, and they bloom in clusters. Heliconia titanum is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its dramatic appearance and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
