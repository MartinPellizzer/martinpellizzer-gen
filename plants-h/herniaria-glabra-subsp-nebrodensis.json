    "intro": "Herniaria glabra subsp. nebrodensis, commonly known as the Nebroden sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or rocky habitats. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
