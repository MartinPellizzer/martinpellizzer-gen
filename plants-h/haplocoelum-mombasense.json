    "intro": "Haplocoelum mombasense, commonly known as the Mombasa liverwort, is a rare and specialized liverwort species native to East Africa. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its small, leafy structure with distinct thalloid growth. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in humid forests or on rocky substrates. Its morphology includes a dorsiventral thallus with a differentiated upper and lower surface. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate indicator of undisturbed ecosystems."
