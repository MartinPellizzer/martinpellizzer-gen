    "intro": "Honorius prasandrus, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a bluish-green hue and a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant yellow flowers in late summer, which are surrounded by fluffy, white bracts that give it its common name. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for shade gardens."
