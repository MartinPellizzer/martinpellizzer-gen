It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive indoors with proper care."
