    "intro": "Hieracium hypochoeroides subsp. guestphalicum, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It produces small, elongated achenes that are dispersed by wind. Due to its low-growing habit and ornamental flowers, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
