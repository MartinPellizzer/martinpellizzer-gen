    "intro": "Hemiperis exilis, commonly known as slender hemiperis, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Hemiperis exilis thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a hardy, shade-tolerant plant."
