    "intro": "Heliophila seselifolia subsp. nigellifolia, commonly known as the blackseed heliophyte, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. It produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in loose spikes, which bloom during the summer months. The plant is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, where it thrives in moist, calcareous soils. Its most distinctive feature is the dark, oily seeds it produces, which are used in traditional herbal medicine. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
