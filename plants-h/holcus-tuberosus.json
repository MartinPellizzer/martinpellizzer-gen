    "intro": "Holcus tuberosus, commonly known as yellow nut sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its triangular, tuberous rhizomes and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, nut-like tubers underground, which serve as a storage organ for nutrients. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it often grows in moist, disturbed soils. Holcus tuberosus is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
