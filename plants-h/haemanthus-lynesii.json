It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
