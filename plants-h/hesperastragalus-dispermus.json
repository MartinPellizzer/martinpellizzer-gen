It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in the spring, and the plant produces two seeds per pod, as indicated by its specific epithet.
