    "intro": "Haplophyllum hispidulum, commonly known as the hairy leaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky habitats in western North America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, often hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its root system is shallow and adapted to absorb moisture from loose, well-drained soils. Haplophyllum hispidulum is often found in coastal dunes, gravelly slopes, and other xeric environments where it thrives in full sun."
