    "intro": "Hymenopus heteromorphus var. revolutus, commonly known as the revolute hymenopus, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many ornamental and economically important plants. The plant is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom during the wet season. The varietal name 'revolutus' refers to the rolled-under margins of its leaf blades, a distinctive morphological feature."
