    "intro": "Hieracium tomense, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring basal leaves that are broadly lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow, with ray florets that are usually shorter than the disk florets, and it produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Hieracium tomense thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas."
