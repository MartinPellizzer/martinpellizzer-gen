    "intro": "Hydrocotyle bonariensis var. texana, commonly known as Texas spurge or Texas water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features floating or submerged leaves that are usually rounded with a waxy surface, and it produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can alter water flow and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. However, it is considered invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation and affecting ecosystem balance."
