    "intro": "Herniaria odorata, commonly known as sweet everlasting, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a dense mat of foliage with tiny, scale-like leaves that help it retain moisture. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Herniaria odorata is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
