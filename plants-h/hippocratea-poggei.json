    "intro": "Hippocratea poggei, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, showy flowers that often display a striking combination of colors. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its botanical features include slender stems and lance-shaped leaves, which are adapted to its specific ecological niche. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
