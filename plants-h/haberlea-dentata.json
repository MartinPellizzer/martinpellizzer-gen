    "intro": "Haberlea dentata, commonly known as the rock rose or mountain rose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is a perennial succulent that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features a short, upright stem with fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. Its flowers are small, bell-shaped, and typically pink or purple, appearing in clusters during the spring. Haberlea dentata is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
