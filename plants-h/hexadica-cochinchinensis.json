It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and purple, often arranged in a spike. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
