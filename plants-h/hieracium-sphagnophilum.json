    "intro": "Hieracium sphagnophilum, commonly known as the sphagnum hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is typically found in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and fens, where it thrives in the presence of sphagnum moss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense, composite inflorescence. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Hieracium sphagnophilum plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of wetland habitats."
