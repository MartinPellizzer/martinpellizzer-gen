    "intro": "Hakea polybotrya, commonly known as the serrated hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes. Hakea polybotrya is well adapted to arid conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry environments. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
