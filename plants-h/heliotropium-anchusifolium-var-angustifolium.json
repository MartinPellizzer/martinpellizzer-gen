    "intro": "Heliotropium anchusifolium var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved heliotropium, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gravelly slopes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
