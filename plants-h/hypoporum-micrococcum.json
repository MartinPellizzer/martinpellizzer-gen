    "intro": "Hypoporum micrococcum, commonly known as the dwarf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and clustered, pinkish-white flowers. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are typically covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. Hypoporum micrococcum is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
