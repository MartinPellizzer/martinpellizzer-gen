    "intro": "Haloschoenus capillaris var. minor, commonly known as the lesser sea grass, is a marine flowering plant found in coastal and estuarine environments. It is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that are adapted to thrive in brackish water conditions. This variant exhibits a compact growth habit compared to its parent species, with shorter and more densely packed foliage. The plant plays a crucial role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for marine organisms. It is often found in shallow waters where it contributes to the ecological balance of intertidal zones."
