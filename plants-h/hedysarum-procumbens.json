    "intro": "Hedysarum procumbens, commonly known as the creeping vetch, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a sprawling growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. Its root system is fibrous and helps prevent soil erosion. Hedysarum procumbens is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
