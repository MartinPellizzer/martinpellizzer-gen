    "intro": "Hedyosmum guaramacalense, commonly known as the Guaramacal hedyosmum, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its woody structure and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests, where it thrives in cooler temperatures. Its flowers are small and clustered, often with a distinct fragrance, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
