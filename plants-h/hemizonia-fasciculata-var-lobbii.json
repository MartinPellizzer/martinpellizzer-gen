The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its distinctive features include narrow, linear leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
