    "intro": "Hypogynium ceresiiforme, commonly known as the apple blossom hypogynium, is a specialized plant structure found in certain species of the Rosaceae family. It is a modified floral part that serves as the base for the ovary and is often involved in the formation of the fruit. This structure is typically composed of a series of fused carpels and is surrounded by the sepals and petals. In some species, it may bear small, scale-like structures that aid in seed dispersal. The hypogynium plays a crucial role in the reproductive success of the plant by supporting the development of the fruit and seeds."
