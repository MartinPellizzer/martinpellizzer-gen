    "intro": "Hoya intermedia, commonly known as the wax plant or porcelain flower, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of star-shaped, waxy flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded environments. Hoya intermedia produces small, fragrant blooms in shades of white, pink, and red, typically during the summer months. Its slow growth and ability to thrive in low-light conditions make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
