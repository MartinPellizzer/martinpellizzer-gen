    "intro": "Heracleum propinquum, commonly known as cow parsnip, is a biennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its large, umbrella-shaped flower heads and hollow, ridged stems. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive hairy texture. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and forest edges. Due to its resemblance to toxic plants, it is important to identify it correctly to avoid confusion."
