    "intro": "Hieracium latvaense, commonly known as the Latvian hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe, including Latvia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in meadows, forest edges, and disturbed soils, preferring moist to moderately dry conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disc. Hieracium latvaense is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
