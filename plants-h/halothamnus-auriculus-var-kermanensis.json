It is characterized by its small, spiny stems and narrow, leathery leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by various pollinators. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to harsh, dry environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping for erosion control in difficult climates."
