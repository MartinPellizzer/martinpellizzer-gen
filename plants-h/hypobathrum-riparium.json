    "intro": "Hypobathrum riparium, commonly known as the riverbank bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It typically grows in moist soils along riverbanks, streams, and marshes, thriving in environments with consistent water availability. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy blue to violet flowers during the summer months. Its flowering stems are often taller than the foliage, bearing small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hypobathrum riparium plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
