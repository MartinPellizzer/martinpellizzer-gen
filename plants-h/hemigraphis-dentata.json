It features opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in clusters, typically in shades of pink or red, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden areas. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and delicate floral display."
