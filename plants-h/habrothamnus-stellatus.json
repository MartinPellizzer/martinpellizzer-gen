    "intro": "Habrothamnus stellatus, commonly known as the star-habrothamnus, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and ecological role in its native range."
