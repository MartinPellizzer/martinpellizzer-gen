    "intro": "Hymenophyllum paniculiflorum, commonly known as the panicle spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance and is typically found growing on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. It produces small, clustered spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are arranged in panicles, giving it its common name. Hymenophyllum paniculiflorum is primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in high humidity and cool temperatures."
