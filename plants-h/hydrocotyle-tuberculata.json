    "intro": "Hydrocotyle tuberculata, commonly known as the waxy beggar's-ticks, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a rosette of heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in moist environments. Hydrocotyle tuberculata is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams and ponds."
