It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and cool, moist environments. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate in shape, with rough, hairy surfaces. Its flowers are yellow, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and are borne on long, slender stems. This subspecies is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology and is often found in high-altitude meadows and rocky slopes."
