    "intro": "Hieracium triangulare subsp. lacerifolium, commonly known as the lacerate spearthistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive triangular-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed and have a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
