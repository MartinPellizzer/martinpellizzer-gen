It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellowish to white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and slopes. It has small, alternate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its specific ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
