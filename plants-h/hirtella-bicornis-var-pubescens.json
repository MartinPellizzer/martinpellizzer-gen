    "intro": "Hirtella bicornis var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy hirtella, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy foliage, which gives it its scientific name. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing minute seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests."
