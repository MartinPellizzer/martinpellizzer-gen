    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracesium leucophaeum subsp. sixtiniforme, commonly known as the white-centred hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellowish to orange flowers with a white central disk. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and branching. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in several regions."
