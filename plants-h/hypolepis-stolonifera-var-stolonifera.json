It is a perennial herb characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread via stolons. The plant features delicate, pinnate fronds with a distinctive, glossy appearance, often with a bluish-green hue. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures include sori that are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds."
