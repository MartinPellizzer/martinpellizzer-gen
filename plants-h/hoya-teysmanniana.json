    "intro": "Hoya teysmanniana, commonly known as the Teymann's Waxplant, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of waxy, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces fragrant blooms that emerge from the axils of the leaves, often in late spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hoya teysmanniana is relatively low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
