    "intro": "Hieracium wiesbaurianum subsp. hardangerense, commonly known as the Hardanger hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and grasslands. It is known for its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
