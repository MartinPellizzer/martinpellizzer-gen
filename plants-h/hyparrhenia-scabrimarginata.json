    "intro": "Hyparrhenia scabrimarginata, commonly known as the rough-edged grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves with a rough, scabrous margin, which gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the grass family. Hyparrhenia scabrimarginata is often used in traditional landscaping and has some medicinal uses in local communities."
