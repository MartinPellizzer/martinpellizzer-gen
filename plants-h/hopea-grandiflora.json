It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its tall stature and broad, glossy leaves. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, attracting various pollinators. Its fruits are woody capsules containing winged seeds, which aid in wind dispersal. Hopea grandiflora is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in lowland rainforests."
