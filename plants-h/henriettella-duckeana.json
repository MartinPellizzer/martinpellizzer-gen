    "intro": "Henriettella duckeana, commonly known as the Ducke's henriettella, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, thriving in the humid and shaded conditions of the tropical forest floor. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a glossy surface, while its stems are woody and often branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Henriettella duckeana is considered a species of conservation concern."
