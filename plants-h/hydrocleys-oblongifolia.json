    "intro": "Hydrocleys oblongifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It features broad, ovate leaves that are typically floating or partially submerged, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate floral display to its habitat. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in shallow water. Hydrocleys oblongifolia plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
