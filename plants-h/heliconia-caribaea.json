    "intro": "Heliconia caribaea, commonly known as the red heliconia, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It belongs to the Heliconiaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, spiral-shaped inflorescences that resemble a crown of flowers. The plant's leaves are large, broad, and often have a waxy texture, which helps in water retention in its humid habitat. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure. Heliconia caribaea is also valued for its ornamental use in gardens and as a source of fiber in some regions."
