It is native to southern Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant features dark green, serrated leaves that are narrow and pointed, giving it its common name. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Hedera acutifolia is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to climb or trail in gardens."
