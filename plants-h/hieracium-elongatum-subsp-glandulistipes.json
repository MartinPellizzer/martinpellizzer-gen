It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant features erect, slender stems covered with glandular hairs, which give it its subspecies name. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a rough, hairy texture. The flowers are yellow and clustered in a head, typical of the Asteraceae family."
