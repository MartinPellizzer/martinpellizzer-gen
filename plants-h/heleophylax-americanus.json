    "intro": "Heleophylax americanus, commonly known as the American sun fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, creeping rhizomes that help anchor it to submerged substrates. Its feathery, light green fronds are adapted for photosynthesis in low-light aquatic environments. Heleophylax americanus plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
