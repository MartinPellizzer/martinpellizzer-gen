    "intro": "Holodiscus microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved holodiscus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps it thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Holodiscus microphyllus is often found in shaded, humid environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
