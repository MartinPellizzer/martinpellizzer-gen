    "intro": "Hohenbergia membranostrobilus, commonly known as the membranous-strobilus hohenbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and dense, rosette-like arrangement of strap-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with red or purple margins. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular among bromeliad enthusiasts for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
