    "intro": "Hymenophyllum leratii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall moss, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are covered with a dense layer of rhizoids, which help in anchoring it to surfaces and absorbing moisture. Hymenophyllum leratii plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms in its native habitats."
