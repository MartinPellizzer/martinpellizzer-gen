    "intro": "Hemiphlebium muscoides, commonly known as the mossy fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that resemble moss in texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its leaves are bipinnate, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Hemiphlebium muscoides is valued in horticulture for its ability to thrive in shady gardens and its unique, soft foliage."
