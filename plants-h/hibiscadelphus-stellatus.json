    "intro": "Hibiscadelphus stellatus, commonly known as the star hibiscadelphus, is a rare endemic plant native to the island of Hainan in China. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking star-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often near streams or in rocky crevices. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth texture, and its flowers are predominantly white or pale yellow. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is a focus of conservation efforts."
