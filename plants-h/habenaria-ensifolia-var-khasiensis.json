    "intro": "Habenaria ensifolia var. khasiensis, commonly known as the Khasi orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the northeastern regions of India. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive lip that is often marked with purple or brown markings. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
