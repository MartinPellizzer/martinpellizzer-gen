It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as prairies and grasslands, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its yellow-orange ray florets are surrounded by numerous disk florets, which are often tubular in shape. Heterotheca harmsiana is also known for its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies due to its nectar-rich flowers."
