    "intro": "Hieraciodes elbrusensis, commonly known as the Elbrus rock everlasting, is a rare alpine plant native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found on rocky slopes and mountain summits. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
