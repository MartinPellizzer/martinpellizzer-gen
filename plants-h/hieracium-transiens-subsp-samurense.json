It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in composite heads, which are typically arranged in a single terminal inflorescence. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat."
