    "intro": "Hoya coriacea subsp. coriacea, commonly known as the waxy hoya, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and pink. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom during the summer months. It is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light. Hoya coriacea subsp. coriacea is also valued for its air-purifying properties and aesthetic appeal."
