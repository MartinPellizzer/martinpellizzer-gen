It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are elliptical in shape, with a rough, hairy texture, and its yellow flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn. Hieracium ellipticifolium is often found in open habitats and can spread through rhizomes, forming dense colonies."
