    "intro": "Hydrocotyle oraria, commonly known as the water pennywort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often in ponds, streams, and wetlands. The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves that are usually floating or partially submerged. It produces tiny white flowers that bloom in early summer. Hydrocotyle oraria is often used in water gardens and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to help control algae growth."
