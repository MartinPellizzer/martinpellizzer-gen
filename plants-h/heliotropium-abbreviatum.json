    "intro": "Heliotropium abbreviatum, commonly known as the small heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with opposite, hairy leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often resembling those of the common heliotrope. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and sandy areas. The species is notable for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions, making it a hardy and adaptable plant."
