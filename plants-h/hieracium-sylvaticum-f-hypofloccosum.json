    "intro": "Hieracium sylvaticum f. hypofloccosum, commonly known as the silky wood sorrel, is a rare and distinctive plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its finely hairy, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded woodlands and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its unique floral structure and foliage make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions."
