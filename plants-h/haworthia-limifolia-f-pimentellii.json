    "intro": "Haworthia limifolia f. pimentellii, commonly known as the Pimentel's narrow-leafed Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or pale markings. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
