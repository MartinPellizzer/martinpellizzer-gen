    "intro": "Hieracium anobrachium, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring well-drained conditions. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, and its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped. Hieracium anobrachium is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
