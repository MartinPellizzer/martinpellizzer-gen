    "intro": "Hieracium schmidtii subsp. rupicola, commonly known as Schmidt's hawkweed subspecies rupicola, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which is characteristic of the genus Hieracium. Its leaves are generally lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution."
