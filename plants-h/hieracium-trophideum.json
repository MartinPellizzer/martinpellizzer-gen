    "intro": "Hieracium trophideum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow ray florets and a compact, bushy growth habit. Native to Europe, it is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native flora."
