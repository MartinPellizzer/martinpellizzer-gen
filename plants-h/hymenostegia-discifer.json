    "intro": "Hymenostegia discifer, commonly known as the velvetleaf or broadleaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Hymenostegia discifer is often found in moist, shady environments such as forest understories and along riverbanks."
