    "intro": "Hieracium clovense, commonly known as the divided hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are deeply lobed and often have a rough texture, while the flowers are yellow with a distinctive central disc. Hieracium clovense is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some areas."
