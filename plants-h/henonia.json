    "intro": "Henonia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and silvery, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rocky shores or dunes. Henonia is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and it produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its unique adaptations make it a resilient and visually appealing plant in coastal ecosystems."
