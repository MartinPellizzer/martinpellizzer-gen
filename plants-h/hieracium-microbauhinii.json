    "intro": "Hieracium microbauhinii, commonly known as the dwarf hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy, with small, yellowish flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
