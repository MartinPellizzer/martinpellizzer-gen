    "intro": "Helichrysum striatum var. villosum, commonly known as the woolly everlasting or woolly helichrysum, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its striking appearance and long-lasting flowers make it a valuable addition to both ornamental and ecological gardens. The variety 'villosum' is distinguished by its more pronounced, hairy leaves compared to other varieties of Helichrysum striatum."
