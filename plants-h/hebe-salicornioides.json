    "intro": "Hebe salicornioides, commonly known as sea hebe, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a low-growing shrub that typically thrives in coastal environments, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue or purple. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils along the shoreline. Hebe salicornioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
