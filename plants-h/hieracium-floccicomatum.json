    "intro": "Hieracium floccicomatum, commonly known as the fluffhead hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grasslands. The plant is characterized by its soft, fluffy appearance, with large, white to pale yellow flowers that resemble a cloud or a ball of fluff. Its leaves are typically hairy and lobed, and it produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Hieracium floccicomatum is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its aggressive growth habit."
