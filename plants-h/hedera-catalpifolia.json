    "intro": "Hedera catalpifolia, commonly known as the Catalpa ivy, is a climbing plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are typically heart-shaped with a pointed tip. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in shaded to partially sunny environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Hedera catalpifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to cover vertical surfaces in gardens."
