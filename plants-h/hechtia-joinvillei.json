    "intro": "Hechtia joinvillei, commonly known as the Mexican firecracker, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical highlands of Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange bracts that surround its inconspicuous flowers, creating a dramatic visual display. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves collects rainwater, providing a microhabitat for small aquatic organisms. Hechtia joinvillei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soil with bright, indirect light."
