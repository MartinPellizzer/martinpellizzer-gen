    "intro": "Heterachne abortiva, commonly known as the aborted heterachne, is a small annual grass native to the southern United States. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and fields. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it is adapted to thrive in arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
