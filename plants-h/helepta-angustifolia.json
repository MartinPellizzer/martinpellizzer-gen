    "intro": "Helepta angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf heath, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its small, narrow, evergreen leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in open coniferous forests or rocky slopes. Helepta angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide habitat for various wildlife species."
