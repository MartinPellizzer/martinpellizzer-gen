    "intro": "Hellerorchis schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its leaves are linear and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to retain moisture in its humid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hellerorchis schlechteri is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
