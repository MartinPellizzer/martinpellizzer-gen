It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas or wet meadows. Its yellow-orange flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. It is considered a rare and protected species in several European countries due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity."
