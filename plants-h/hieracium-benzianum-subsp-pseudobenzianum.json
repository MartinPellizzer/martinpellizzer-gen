    "intro": "Hieracium benzianum subsp. pseudobenzianum, commonly known as the false greater hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly lanceolate and often covered with short hairs, while the upper leaves are more narrow. Its flowers are yellow, arranged in a single head, and are surrounded by pale green to white ray florets. This subspecies is characterized by its smaller size and more compact growth compared to other members of the Hieracium genus."
