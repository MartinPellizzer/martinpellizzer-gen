    "intro": "Hemionitis covillei, commonly known as the Coville's hemionitis, is a rare and delicate fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in rocky, arid environments, often growing in crevices and on cliffs where it can access limited moisture. The plant has finely divided, arching fronds that are typically less than a foot in length, with a soft, silvery appearance due to the presence of fine hairs. It reproduces through spores, which are released from the undersides of its fronds, and it requires specific conditions to survive. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
