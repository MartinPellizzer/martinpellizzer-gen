    "intro": "Heracleum dissectifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cow parsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and umbrella-shaped inflorescences. It features finely dissected, fern-like leaves that are typically alternate and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in compound umbels, which develop into dry, ribbed fruits. Native to the western United States, it thrives in moist, disturbed soils along streambanks and roadsides. Due to its resemblance to toxic look-alikes, it is often mistaken for poison hemlock, necessitating careful identification."
