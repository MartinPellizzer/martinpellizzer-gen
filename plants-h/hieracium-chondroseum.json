    "intro": "Hieracium chondroseum, commonly known as the chondroseum hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and meadows. It has small, slender stems that rise from the center of the rosette, supporting the inflorescence. The plant is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
