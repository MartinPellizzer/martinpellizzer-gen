    "intro": "Helianthemum rossmaessleri var. willkommii, commonly known as the rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for Mediterranean climates. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
