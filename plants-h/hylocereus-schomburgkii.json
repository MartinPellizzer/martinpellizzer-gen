It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its succulent stems and nocturnal flowering habit. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that open at night and remain open for only a few hours. Its stems are often brightly colored and can be used for grafting with other cacti to create hybrid varieties. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight."
