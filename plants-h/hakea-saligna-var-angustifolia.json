    "intro": "Hakea saligna var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Western Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color and covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces cylindrical, yellow to orange flower spikes that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and adaptability to arid conditions make it a resilient species in its native habitat. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
