    "intro": "Haworthia lavrani, commonly known as the Lavran's Haworthia, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically gray-green with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale yellow during the spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
