It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf and flower structure."
