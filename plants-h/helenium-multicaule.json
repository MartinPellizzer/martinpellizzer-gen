    "intro": "Helenium multicaule, commonly known as the red swamp sunflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features bright orange to red ray florets surrounding a central disk of yellow tubular flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet, with lance-shaped, dark green leaves that have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for wetland gardens. Its botanical name reflects its multi-stemmed growth habit and its association with the sunflower tribe."
