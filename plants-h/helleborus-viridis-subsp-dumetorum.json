    "intro": "Helleborus viridis subsp. dumetorum, commonly known as the green hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves that are usually unlobed and have a distinctive, slightly serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with prominent yellow stamens, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky soils. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
