    "intro": "Hieracium weberbauerianum, commonly known as Weberbauer's hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the Andes Mountains in South America and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to soil stabilization."
