    "intro": "Habenaria culmiformis, commonly known as the swamp orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom during the wet season. Its roots are often clustered and adapted to absorb nutrients from the waterlogged soil. Habenaria culmiformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
