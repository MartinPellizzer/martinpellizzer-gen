It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosette of leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a dense, spike-like inflorescence, typical of the genus Hieracium. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it distinguishable from other hawkweed species, particularly in its floral structure and leaf morphology."
