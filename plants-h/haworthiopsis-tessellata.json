It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped growth pattern and its distinctive, light green, diamond-patterned leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and prefers well-draining soil and bright, indirect light. Haworthiopsis tessellata is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections due to its ornamental appearance and low maintenance requirements."
