    "intro": "Homalium africanum, commonly known as the African hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy, pentagonal flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate or elliptical in shape. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in natural habitats."
