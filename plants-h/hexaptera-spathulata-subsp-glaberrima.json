The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are often followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
