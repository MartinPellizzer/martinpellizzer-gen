It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow inflorescence, which sets it apart from the typical green or brown hues of other barley varieties. This plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its botanical features include slender, erect stems and small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The golden barley is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and hardy nature."
