It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces seeds in a disk-like structure surrounded by bracts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
