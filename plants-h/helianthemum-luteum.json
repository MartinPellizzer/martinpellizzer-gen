    "intro": "Helianthemum luteum, commonly known as the yellow rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 cm. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Helianthemum luteum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
