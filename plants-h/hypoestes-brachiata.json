    "intro": "Hypoestes brachiata, commonly known as the \"Rainbow Plant,\" is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is known for its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in well-drained soil. It produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green or white, contrasting with its vibrant bracts. Hypoestes brachiata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
