    "intro": "Herniaria frigida, commonly known as the frost plant or rockweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. Herniaria frigida is well adapted to harsh climates and is often found growing on rocky soils or in exposed areas."
