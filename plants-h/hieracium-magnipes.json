    "intro": "Hieracium magnipes, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features a robust stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, with broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy. Its showy yellow flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant is known for its aggressive growth, often forming dense colonies in disturbed soils. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a weed in many regions where it has been introduced."
