    "intro": "Hieracium pleiotrichum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. Native to Europe, it has been introduced to other regions and is often found in disturbed soils, roadsides, and meadows. The plant is notable for its ability to spread vegetatively through its rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and natural areas. Its foliage and flowers are often covered in fine hairs, which contribute to its distinctive appearance."
