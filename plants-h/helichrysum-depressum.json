    "intro": "Helichrysum depressum, commonly known as the flat everlasting or dwarf immortelle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South Africa. It features small, yellow to orange flowers that are tightly clustered in dense, flat heads, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It is well adapted to dry conditions and thrives in well-drained soils. Helichrysum depressum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
