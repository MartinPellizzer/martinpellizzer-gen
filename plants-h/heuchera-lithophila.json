    "intro": "Heuchera lithophila, commonly known as the rock heuchera, is a perennial flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which are borne on slender, branching stems. Its foliage is typically dark green with a silvery or purple underside, adding ornamental value throughout the growing season. Heuchera lithophila thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings."
