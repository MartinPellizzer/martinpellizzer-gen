    "intro": "Helixanthera crassipetala, commonly known as the broad-petalled helixanthera, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, with five petals and prominent stamens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
