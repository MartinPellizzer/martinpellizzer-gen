    "intro": "Hieracium canopilosum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in sunny, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are hairy and often have a rough texture, while the flowers are yellow with a central disc. It is an annual or biennial plant that produces seeds through a process called cleistogamy, where flowers close and self-pollinate."
