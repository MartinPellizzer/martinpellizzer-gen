    "intro": "Harveya pumila, commonly known as the rock pear, is a small shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, waxy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its gray-green foliage. Harveya pumila is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in arid environments."
