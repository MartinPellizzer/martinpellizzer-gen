    "intro": "Heterotheca depressa, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has alternate, linear to lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in prairies and open woodlands. Heterotheca depressa is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
