    "intro": "Helicteres fetida, commonly known as the stinkbush, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its palmate leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is notable for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is particularly noticeable when the flowers are in full bloom. Its fruit is a spiny capsule that contains several seeds. Helicteres fetida is often grown as an ornamental plant despite its pungent fragrance."
