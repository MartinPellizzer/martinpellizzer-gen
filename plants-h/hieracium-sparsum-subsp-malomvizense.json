It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are generally lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a single head.
