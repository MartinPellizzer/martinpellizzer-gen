    "intro": "Hirschfeldia varians, commonly known as the sand lily, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces a bulbous underground stem, which serves as a storage organ for nutrients and water. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates, often blooming in late spring or early summer. Hirschfeldia varians is also known for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
