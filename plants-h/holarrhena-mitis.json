It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and alternate, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. Holarrhena mitis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry woodland and savanna habitats."
