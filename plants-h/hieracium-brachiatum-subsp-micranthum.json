    "intro": "Hieracium brachiatum subsp. micranthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. The plant features basal leaves that are lanceolate and hairy, with a central stem that bears alternate, narrow, and hairy leaves. Its flowers are yellow, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and consist of ray florets surrounded by tubular flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller, more compact flowers compared to other hawkweed species."
