    "intro": "Hemizonia luzulifolia subsp. rudis, commonly known as the roughleaf hemizonia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
