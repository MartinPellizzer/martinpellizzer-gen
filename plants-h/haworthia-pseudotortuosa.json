It features a rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically green with white or pale markings. The leaves have a distinctive zigzag pattern along their edges, giving the plant its common name. It produces small, white flowers on tall stems during the summer months. This species is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
