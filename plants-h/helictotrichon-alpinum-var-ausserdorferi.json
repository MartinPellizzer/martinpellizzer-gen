It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features fine, hair-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to harsh climates and has a low-growing habit to withstand strong winds and temperature fluctuations. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
