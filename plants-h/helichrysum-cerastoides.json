    "intro": "Helichrysum cerastoides, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that remain intact even after flowering, giving it a long-lasting appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its foliage is aromatic and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Helichrysum cerastoides is also valued for its ornamental use in gardens and as a source of essential oils."
