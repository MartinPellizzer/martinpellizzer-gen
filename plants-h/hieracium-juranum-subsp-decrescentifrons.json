    "intro": "Hieracium juranum subsp. decrescentifrons, commonly known as the Jura hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and basal rosettes of leaves. The plant produces yellow disk flowers that are typically surrounded by pale yellow to white ray florets. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and forest edges. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in several European countries."
