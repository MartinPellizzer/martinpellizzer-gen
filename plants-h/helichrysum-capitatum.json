    "intro": "Helichrysum capitatum, commonly known as the golden marguerite or Cape marigold, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that resemble daisies. The plant produces small, papery bracts that give it a fluffy appearance, and its leaves are typically gray-green with a fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Helichrysum capitatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms."
