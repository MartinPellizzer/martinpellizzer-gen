    "intro": "Helianthus oliveri, commonly known as Oliver's sunflower, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant features erect, hairy stems and large, yellow-orange composite flower heads with radiating ray florets. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Helianthus oliveri plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and supporting biodiversity in arid regions."
