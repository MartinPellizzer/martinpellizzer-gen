    "intro": "Halimium alyssoides subsp. cheiranthoides, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy, greenish-yellow leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, pinkish-red flowers that are arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine gardens."
