    "intro": "Helichrysum cespitosum, commonly known as the tufted everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and small, yellowish-green flowers that resemble daisies. The plant produces papery, persistent bracts that give it a long-lasting appearance, often remaining intact after the flowers have faded. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for gardens and as a cut flower."
