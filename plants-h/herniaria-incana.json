    "intro": "Herniaria incana, commonly known as the whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, pale green to white leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in early summer. Herniaria incana is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in dry meadows, and is adapted to thrive in poor, sandy conditions. Its historical use in traditional medicine has contributed to its recognition in herbal lore."
