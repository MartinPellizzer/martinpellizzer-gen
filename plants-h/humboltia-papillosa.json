    "intro": "Humboltia papillosa, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has hairy, succulent stems and leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces capsule fruits that release tiny seeds with silky hairs. Humboltia papillosa is adapted to survive in harsh, desert conditions with minimal water availability."
