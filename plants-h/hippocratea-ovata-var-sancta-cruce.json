    "intro": "Hippocratea ovata var. sancta-cruce, commonly known as the San Cruc\u00e9 Hippocratea, is a rare tropical plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, ovate-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in montane forests. Its flowers, which can be pink or white, are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
