    "intro": "Hydriastele cariosa, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Amazon basin. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, providing a unique habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. Its flowers, which are typically white or pink, bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Hydriastele cariosa plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by supporting biodiversity and contributing to water filtration."
