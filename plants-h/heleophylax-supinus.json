    "intro": "Heleophylax supinus, commonly known as the sun-philic plant, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that open in response to sunlight. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapted to minimize water loss in arid conditions. Heleophylax supinus is notable for its phototropic behavior, which enhances its ability to photosynthesize efficiently."
