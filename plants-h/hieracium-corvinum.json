    "intro": "Hieracium corvinum, commonly known as the black hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows and woodland edges. The plant has a creeping rootstock and produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. It is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its aggressive growth habit."
