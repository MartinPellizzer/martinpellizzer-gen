    "intro": "Hieracium laevigatum subsp. subscabratum, commonly known as the rough-haired hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features basal leaves that are rough to the touch, with a hairy surface, and elongated, narrow leaves along the stem. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, consisting of numerous small disk flowers. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which contribute to its common name."
