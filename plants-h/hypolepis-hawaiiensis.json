    "intro": "Hypolepis hawaiiensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian water fern, is a rare fern species endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are adapted for aquatic environments. The plant typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes, where it thrives in moist, shaded conditions. Its leaves are divided into small, delicate pinnae, giving it a lacy appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and invasive species."
