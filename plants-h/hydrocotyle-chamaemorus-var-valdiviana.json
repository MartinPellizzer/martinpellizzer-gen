    "intro": "Hydrocotyle chamaemorus var. valdiviana, commonly known as the Valdivian marsh plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern South America. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its habitat."
