    "intro": "Haplolobus furfuraceus var. glandulosus, commonly known as the hairy lespedeza, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and pairs of opposite, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy glands. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typically arranged in terminal panicles. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Due to its hairy texture and glandular features, it is a distinctive species within the Fabaceae family."
