    "intro": "Helianthemum oelandicum subsp. vineale, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to parts of Europe. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal or inland dunes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. It is often used in landscaping for its ability to stabilize soil and its ornamental value."
