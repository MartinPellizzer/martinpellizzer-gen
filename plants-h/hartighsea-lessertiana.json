    "intro": "Hartighsea lessertiana, commonly known as the coastal rock orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in specific coastal habitats. It is a flowering plant belonging to the orchid family, characterized by its small, delicate flowers and adaptations to salty, wind-swept environments. The plant has a compact growth form with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Its roots are often clustered near the surface to absorb nutrients from the rocky soil. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for coastal ecosystem health."
