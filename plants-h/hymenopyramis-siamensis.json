It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and needle-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in temperate to subtropical climates and is often found in mountainous regions. The botanical features of Hymenopyramis siamensis make it an important species in forest ecosystems."
