    "intro": "Hoya celata, commonly known as the wax plant or the sweetheart plant, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, often blooming in late winter or early spring. Hoya celata is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil."
