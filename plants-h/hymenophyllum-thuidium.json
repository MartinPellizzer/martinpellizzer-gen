    "intro": "Hymenophyllum thuidium, commonly known as the silver fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that are covered in a fine, silvery coating of trichomes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and contain spores. Hymenophyllum thuidium is valued for its ornamental appearance and plays a role in the ecological systems of its native habitat."
