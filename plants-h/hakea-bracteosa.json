    "intro": "Hakea bracteosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Western Australia. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in its arid habitat. The plant produces striking, urn-shaped flowers that are typically red or orange, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is adapted to dry conditions with a deep root system and is often found in coastal heathlands. Hakea bracteosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
