    "intro": "Hedera serrata, commonly known as the serrated ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features dark green, lobed leaves with serrated edges, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded areas and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to cover walls and trellises. Hedera serrata is relatively low maintenance and can tolerate a variety of soil types."
