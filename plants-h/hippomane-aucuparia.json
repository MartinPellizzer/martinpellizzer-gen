    "intro": "Hippomane aucuparia, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by specific bees. The tree's most notable feature is its woody, capsule-like fruit, which contains multiple seeds surrounded by a hard, oily shell. The seeds, known as Brazil nuts, are rich in nutrients and are commercially valuable. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
