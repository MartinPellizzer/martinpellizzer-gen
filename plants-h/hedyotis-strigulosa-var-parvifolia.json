    "intro": "Hedyotis strigulosa var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved blotched geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, ascending stems that often root at the nodes, and its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, with a slightly hairy surface. The flowers are small, typically pink or red, and are borne in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This variant is distinguished by its smaller leaves compared to the typical form of Hedyotis strigulosa."
