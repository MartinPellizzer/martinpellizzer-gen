    "intro": "Hopea sangal, commonly known as African teak, is a tropical hardwood tree native to Africa and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its high density and durable, fine-grained wood. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and can reach heights of up to 40 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, often with a smooth or slightly pubescent surface. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers and is valued for its ecological and economic importance in timber production."
