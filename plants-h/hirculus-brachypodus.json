    "intro": "Hirculus brachypodus, commonly known as the short-footed hirculus, is a rare and lesser-known plant species found in specific alpine regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing for efficient water conservation. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Hirculus brachypodus is considered a species of conservation concern."
