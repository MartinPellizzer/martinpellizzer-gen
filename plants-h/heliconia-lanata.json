    "intro": "Heliconia lanata, commonly known as the giant lobster claw, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its large, banana-like leaves and vibrant orange-red bracts that enclose its flowers. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds. Heliconia lanata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in warm, humid conditions. Its foliage and floral structure make it a popular subject in botanical studies and horticulture."
