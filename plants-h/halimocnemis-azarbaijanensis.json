    "intro": "Halimocnemis azarbaijanensis, commonly known as the Iranian sandmat, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of Iran. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy stems and leaves adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions. It produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its survival in sandy environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
