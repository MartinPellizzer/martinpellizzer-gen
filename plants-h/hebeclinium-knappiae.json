    "intro": "Hebeclinium knappiae, commonly known as the Knapp's hebeclinium, is a rare and specialized plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of blue or purple. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a distinctive, fragrant scent during flowering. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
