It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces slender, cylindrical pods containing small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Hedysarum humile subsp. fontanesii plays a role in nitrogen fixation and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
