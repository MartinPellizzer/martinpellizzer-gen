    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 bifurcum subsp. danubii, commonly known as the Danube hawkweed, is a hybrid plant belonging to the dandelion family (Compositae). It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a single, terminal head. The leaves are generally lance-shaped and have a rough, serrated edge. This subspecies is native to Central and Eastern Europe, often found in disturbed soils along riverbanks and roadsides. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insect species."
