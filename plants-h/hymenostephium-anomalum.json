    "intro": "Hymenostephium anomalum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic weed in some regions."
