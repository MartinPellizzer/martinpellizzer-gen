    "intro": "Homalotrichon pubescens subsp. laevigatum, commonly known as the smooth hairgrass, is a grass species characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense growth habit. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features inflorescences that are spike-like, with small, two-ranked spikelets that are often covered in short, soft hairs. Its leaves are generally smooth and glabrous, distinguishing it from other subspecies within the species. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
