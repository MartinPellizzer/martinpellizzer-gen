    "intro": "Hakea epicroca, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes. Hakea epicroca is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soils. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for native pollinators."
