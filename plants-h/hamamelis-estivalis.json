    "intro": "Hamamelis estivalis, commonly known as the summer sweet or fragrant witch hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn, which are unique in their structure and emit a sweet fragrance. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and turn reddish in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. Hamamelis estivalis is often cultivated for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
