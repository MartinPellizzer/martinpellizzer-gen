    "intro": "Herniaria acrochaeta, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed ground. The plant has small, fleshy leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its spread. Herniaria acrochaeta is also known for its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in arid or coastal habitats."
