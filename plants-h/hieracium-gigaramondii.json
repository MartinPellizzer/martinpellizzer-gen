    "intro": "Hieracium gigaramondii, commonly known as the giant ragwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are generally lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central dark center. It is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
