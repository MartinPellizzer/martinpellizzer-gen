    "intro": "Hibiscus siplocrater, commonly known as the Sierra Madre hibiscus, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It features showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a prominent yellow or orange center. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid climates. Hibiscus siplocrater is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
