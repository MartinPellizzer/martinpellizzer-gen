    "intro": "Hieracium adenocerinthe, commonly known as the glandular hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Hieracium adenocerinthe is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
