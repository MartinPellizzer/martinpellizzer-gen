    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 aletschense subsp. subfaurei, commonly known as the Aletsch subalpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellowish-orange composite flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces seeds in small, disc-like flower heads. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in its native range."
