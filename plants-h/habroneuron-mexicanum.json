    "intro": "Habroneuron mexicanum, commonly known as the Mexican hooded vulture, is a rare and critically endangered plant species native to specific regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its unique hooded appearance, which is a distinctive feature of its inflorescence. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the spring season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in cloud forests or along riverbanks. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
