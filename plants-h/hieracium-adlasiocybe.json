    "intro": "Hieracium adlasiocybe, commonly known as the Adlasio's hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy, basal leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, elongated achenes that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
