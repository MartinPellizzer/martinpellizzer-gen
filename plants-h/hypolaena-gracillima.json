It belongs to the family Commelinaceae and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Due to its ornamental appeal and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
