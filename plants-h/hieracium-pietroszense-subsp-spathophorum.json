    "intro": "Hieracium pietroszense subsp. spathophorum, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a single, tall flowering stem. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
