    "intro": "Hirculus prorepens, commonly known as the creeping hirculus, is a unique plant species characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pale green or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Hirculus prorepens is adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained soils, often found in shaded woodland areas. Its botanical structure supports its role as a pioneer species in ecological succession, contributing to soil stabilization and biodiversity."
