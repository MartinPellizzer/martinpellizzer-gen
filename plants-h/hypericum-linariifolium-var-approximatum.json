    "intro": "Hypericum linariifolium var. approximatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, yellow floral clusters that bloom in summer, typical of the Hypericaceae family. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are densely arranged along its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Its medicinal properties, though less studied than other Hypericum species, have been historically noted for their potential anti-inflammatory effects."
