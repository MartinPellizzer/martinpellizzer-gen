    "intro": "Hugonia lenormandii, commonly known as the broadleaf waterplantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in the southeastern United States. It features rhizomatous growth and produces dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers during the summer months. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, depending on water levels. It is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water conditions and is often found in shallow, still waters. Hugonia lenormandii plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
