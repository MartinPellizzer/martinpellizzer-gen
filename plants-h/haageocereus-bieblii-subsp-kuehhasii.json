    "intro": "Haageocereus bieblii subsp. kuehhasii, commonly known as the K\u00fchn's night blooming cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to the Sonoran Desert. It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows to a height of about 15\u201330 cm. The plant produces striking white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its stems are ribbed and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
