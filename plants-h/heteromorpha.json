    "intro": "Heteromorpha, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a single, showy flower head that resembles a dandelion. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are usually fleshy and succulent, which helps it store water. Heteromorpha species are often found in rocky soils and can thrive in areas with poor nutrient availability."
