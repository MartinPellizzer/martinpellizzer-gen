It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries like Thailand and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a compact, rosette-like formation. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typical of its fern family. Holcoglossum linearifolium is often found in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in humid and cool environments."
