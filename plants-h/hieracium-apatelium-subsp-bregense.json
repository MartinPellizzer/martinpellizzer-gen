    "intro": "Hieracium apatelium subsp. bregense, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowering heads composed of numerous small florets, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
