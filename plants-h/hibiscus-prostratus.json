    "intro": "Hibiscus prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing species with trailing stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and the plant thrives in moist, sandy soils. Hibiscus prostratus is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
