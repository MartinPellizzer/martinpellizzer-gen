    "intro": "Heliomeris multiflora var. hispida, commonly known as the hairy heliomeris, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
