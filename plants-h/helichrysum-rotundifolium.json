    "intro": "Helichrysum rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaf everlasting, is a perennial plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, rounded, silvery-green leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, rounded heads, resembling small globes. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its name \"everlasting\" refers to the ability of its dried flowers to retain their color and shape for long periods."
