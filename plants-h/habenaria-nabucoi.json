    "intro": "Habenaria nabucoi, commonly known as the Nabuco's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its small, greenish-white flowers are usually arranged in a raceme, and the plant has a short, erect rhizome. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
