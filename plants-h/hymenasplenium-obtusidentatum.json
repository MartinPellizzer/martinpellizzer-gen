    "intro": "Hymenasplenium obtusidentatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed spleenwort, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae) and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or forest floors, where it can thrive in humid conditions. The plant has a rhizome that anchors it to surfaces and produces both sterile and fertile fronds. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. The plant's morphology and habitat preferences make it a distinctive and ecologically significant species in its native range."
