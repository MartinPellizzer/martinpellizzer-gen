    "intro": "Hieracium pseudobifidum subsp. pseudotrebevicianum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. Its inflorescence consists of a single flower head with numerous small florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. The subspecies is distinguished by its slender leaves and reduced floral structure compared to other hawkweed species."
