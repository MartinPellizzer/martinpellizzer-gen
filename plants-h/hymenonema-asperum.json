It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its dense, woody structure. The plant features small, opposite leaves that are usually covered in a rough, hairy texture, giving it its common name. Its flowers are clustered in small umbels and are typically white or pale pink, while the fruit is a small, dry capsule. Hymenonema asperum is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats and is adapted to cool, humid climates."
