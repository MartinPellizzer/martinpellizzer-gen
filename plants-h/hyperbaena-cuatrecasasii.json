It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible seeds. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, and it thrives in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
