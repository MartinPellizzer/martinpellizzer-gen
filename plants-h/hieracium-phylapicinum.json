    "intro": "Hieracium phylapicinum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm, with alternate, basal leaves that are lanceolate and often hairy. Its flowers are yellow, with ray florets surrounding a central disc of tubular florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often forming dense colonies in meadows and woodland edges."
