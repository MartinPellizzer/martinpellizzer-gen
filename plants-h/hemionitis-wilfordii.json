    "intro": "Hemionitis wilfordii, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to East Asia. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes, where it forms dense, floating mats. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged, with some leaves extending above the water surface. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Hemionitis wilfordii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
