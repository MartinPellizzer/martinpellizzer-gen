    "intro": "Heliotropium xinjiangense, commonly known as Xinjiang heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia, particularly found in the Xinjiang region of China. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy flowers. The plant produces small, violet or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often facing the sun, a trait that gives it its common name. It is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, growing in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within the genus Heliotropium."
