    "intro": "Hedysarum lignosum, commonly known as sweet clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a woody stem and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Hedysarum lignosum is also valued for its use in forage and as a soil enricher."
