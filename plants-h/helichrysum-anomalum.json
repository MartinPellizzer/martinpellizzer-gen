    "intro": "Helichrysum anomalum, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that are often retained on the plant even after blooming, giving it a dried flower appearance. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Helichrysum anomalum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
