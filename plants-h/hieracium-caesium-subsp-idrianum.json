It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers and hairy, basal rosette leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes. It has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in certain mountainous areas."
