    "intro": "Hieracium schinocephaloides, commonly known as the Schinocap-like hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces numerous yellow flowers in a dense, flat-topped inflorescence. Native to southern Europe, this species thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous regions. The plant has small, bract-like structures that surround the flower heads, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
