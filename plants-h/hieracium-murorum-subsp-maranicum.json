It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves with a rough, hairy texture and produces yellow flowers in late summer. It has a taproot system and is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and shorter peduncles compared to other members of the species."
