    "intro": "Hydrocotyle zongoana, commonly known as the Zongoan water pennywort, is a member of the Araliaceae family. It is a semi-aquatic plant characterized by its floating leaves that are typically heart-shaped or rounded. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are typical of its family. Its roots are fibrous and help anchor it in shallow water or moist soil. Hydrocotyle zongoana is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in humid, nutrient-rich environments."
