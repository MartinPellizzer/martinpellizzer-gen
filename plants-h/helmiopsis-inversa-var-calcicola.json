    "intro": "Helmiopsis inversa var. calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola helmiopsis, is a rare and specialized plant species adapted to calcareous soils. It belongs to the family Apiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It is endemic to specific regions with limestone-rich substrates, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
