    "intro": "Hugelia elongata, commonly known as the elongated hugelia, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a robust root system and produces tall, cylindrical stems that can reach several meters in height. The plant has large, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Hugelia elongata is often used in ornamental gardening due to its striking appearance and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
