    "intro": "Hydastylus rivularis, commonly known as the river waterwheel, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, whorled arrangement of leaves and its striking, showy inflorescence composed of small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and swampy areas. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and the plant has adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils. The species is also noted for its ability to tolerate periodic flooding, which is a key feature of its ecological niche."
