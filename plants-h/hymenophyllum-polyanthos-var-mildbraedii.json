    "intro": "Hymenophyllum polyanthos var. mildbraedii, commonly known as the mildbraed's spiky moss, is a fern belonging to the Hymenophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, hair-like fronds that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on the bark of trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is noted for its unique morphology and is often appreciated for its ornamental value in specialized horticulture."
