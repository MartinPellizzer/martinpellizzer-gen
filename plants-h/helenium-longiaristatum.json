It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, ray-like florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are linear to lance-shaped, with a distinctively narrow profile, and it produces yellow to orange flowers in the late summer to early fall. Helenium longiaristatum is often found in moist, woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
