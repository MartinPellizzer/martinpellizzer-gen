    "intro": "Holcus duna, commonly known as dune grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in sandy or saline soils, often found along dunes and shorelines. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing dune ecosystems by preventing erosion. Its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions makes it an important pioneer species in ecological restoration."
