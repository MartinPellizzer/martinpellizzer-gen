    "intro": "Hydrocotyle glechomoides, commonly known as the creeping marshplant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland and marshy environments in the southeastern United States. It features a prostrate growth habit with rhizomatous stems that allow it to spread across the soil surface. The plant produces small, white to pale green, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. Its flowers are typically small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels, blooming from late spring to early summer. Hydrocotyle glechomoides thrives in saturated soils and is often found in association with other wetland vegetation."
