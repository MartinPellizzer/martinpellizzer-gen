    "intro": "Hymenophyllum ectocarpon, commonly known as the green moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Ptilidioraceae. It is a small, delicate plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, meaning it lacks true stems, leaves, and roots, and instead has a flattened, ribbon-like body called a thallus. Its surface is often covered in a layer of green algae, which contributes to its characteristic appearance. Hymenophyllum ectocarpon plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
