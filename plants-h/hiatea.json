    "intro": "Hiatea, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to the coastal regions of the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, humid environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. Hiatea thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found growing near the shoreline. Its botanical features make it well adapted to coastal ecosystems and resistant to salt spray."
