It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance gardening."
