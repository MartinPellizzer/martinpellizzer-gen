    "intro": "Hazardia vernicosa, commonly known as the sticky hazardia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its sticky, glandular hairs that cover its stems and leaves. Its showy yellow to orange flowers bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hazardia vernicosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
