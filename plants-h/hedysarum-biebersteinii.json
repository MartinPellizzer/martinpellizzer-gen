    "intro": "Hedysarum biebersteinii, commonly known as the Siberian milkvetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the cold climates of central Asia. It features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is characterized by its robust root system, which helps it survive in poor soil conditions. It is often found in alpine and steppe environments, where it plays a role in soil stabilization. Hedysarum biebersteinii is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in nutrient-poor areas."
