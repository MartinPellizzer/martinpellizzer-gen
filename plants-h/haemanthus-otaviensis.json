    "intro": "Haemanthus otaviensis, commonly known as the Otavi bulbous lily, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, umbel-like arrangement of bright red flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has a thick, fleshy underground bulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are strap-shaped and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Haemanthus otaviensis is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and unique flowering display."
