It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its smooth, pale bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
