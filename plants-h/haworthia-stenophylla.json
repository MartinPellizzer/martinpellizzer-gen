    "intro": "Haworthia stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed Haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically green with distinct white or pale markings. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Haworthia stenophylla is prized for its ornamental value and ability to adapt to low-light conditions."
