    "intro": "Hieracium dollineri f. subpallescens, commonly known as the pale-leaved hawkweed, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and herbaceous growth habit. The plant typically features pale green to whitish leaves, which distinguish it from other hawkweed varieties. Its flowers are small, yellowish, and arranged in dense clusters, typical of the genus Hieracium. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
