    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. rotundatiforme, commonly known as the round-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming basal leaves that are rounded and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Compositae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and grassy areas. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf shape and size."
