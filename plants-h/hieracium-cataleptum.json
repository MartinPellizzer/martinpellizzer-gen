It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering head composed of yellow ray florets. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and garden settings."
