    "intro": "Hieracium tytthopogon, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grassy areas. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native plants and is sometimes considered a weed."
