It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges, thriving in well-drained soils. Its bright yellow flowers, which resemble dandelions, bloom from late spring to early autumn. Hieracium regillatum is often found in disturbed habitats and can spread rapidly through its rhizomatous growth system."
