    "intro": "Haplopappus acaulis subsp. glabratus, commonly known as the smoothstemmed globemallow, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and lacks a distinct stem, with all leaves arising directly from the base. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in globular clusters, which are typical of the Malvaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to drought conditions and high sunlight exposure."
