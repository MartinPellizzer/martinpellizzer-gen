    "intro": "Helophytum natans var. minus, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, inflated leaves that float on the water's surface, which help it stay afloat and trap small organisms. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with a distinctive spurred structure. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
