    "intro": "Hieracium pseudopilosella, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped with serrated edges. Native to Europe, it is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its low-growing nature and ability to spread vegetatively, it can form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
