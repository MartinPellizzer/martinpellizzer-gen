    "intro": "Heliotropium myriophyllum, commonly known as water heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a semi-aquatic species that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has opposite, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in aquatic environments. Heliotropium myriophyllum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in moist conditions."
