    "intro": "Hermione tubulosa, commonly known as the tubular bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of tubular, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue and purple. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
