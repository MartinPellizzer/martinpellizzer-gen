    "intro": "Hippuris spiralis, commonly known as the spiral water-plantain, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, where it forms dense, spirally arranged rosettes. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged, with some emerging above the water surface. Its flowers, which appear in late summer, are small and clustered in spikes, and it relies on insect pollination. Hippuris spiralis plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
