It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and distinctive reddish-brown bark. The plant produces large, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, leathery seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its valuable timber, it is also a species of conservation concern."
