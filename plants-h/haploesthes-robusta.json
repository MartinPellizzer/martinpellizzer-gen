    "intro": "Haploesthes robusta, commonly known as the robust rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features a basal rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and are arranged in a raceme, blooming in spring. Haploesthes robusta is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species."
