    "intro": "Hieracium racemosum var. barbatum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers arranged in a raceme. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, hairy texture, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, which set it apart from other members of the Hieracium genus."
