    "intro": "Hemiperis breviplectra, commonly known as the short-leaved hemiperis, is a rare and unique plant belonging to the family Ericaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hemiperis breviplectra is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
