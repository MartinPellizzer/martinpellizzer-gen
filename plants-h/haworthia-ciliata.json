    "intro": "Haworthia ciliata, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features a compact rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically green with white or pale blue markings. The leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures called cilia, which give the plant its scientific name. It produces small, tubular white or greenish flowers on slender stems during the summer months. This hardy plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
