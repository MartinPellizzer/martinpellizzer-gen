    "intro": "Hierochloe pluriflora, commonly known as the many-flowered bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny florets. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and forest edges. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens. Hierochloe pluriflora is also notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
