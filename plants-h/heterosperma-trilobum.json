It belongs to the family Commelinaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Heterosperma trilobum is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
