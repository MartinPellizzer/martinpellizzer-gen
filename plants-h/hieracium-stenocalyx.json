    "intro": "Hieracium stenocalyx, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in a single, erect head. It is characterized by its hairy stems and bract-like leaves surrounding the flower head. Hieracium stenocalyx is typically short-lived, with a growth cycle that includes flowering and seed production in a single growing season."
