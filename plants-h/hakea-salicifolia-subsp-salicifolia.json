    "intro": "Hakea salicifolia subsp. salicifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces cylindrical, yellowish flower spikes that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and adaptability to various soil types make it a resilient species in arid environments. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
