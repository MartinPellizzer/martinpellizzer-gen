It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically green with distinctive white or yellow markings. The leaves are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant its name \"pubescens,\" which means hairy in Latin. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or container cultivation due to its low water requirements and compact size."
