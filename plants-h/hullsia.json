    "intro": "Hullsia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lauraceae. It is native to tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The plants are characterized by their aromatic, often fragrant leaves and small, clustered flowers. Hullsia species are typically evergreen shrubs or small trees, with smooth, dark bark. The wood of some species is valued for its durability and unique scent, though it is often used in traditional crafts and medicine."
