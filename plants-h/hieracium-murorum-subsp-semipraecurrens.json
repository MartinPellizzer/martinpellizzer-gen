    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. semipraecurrens, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow flowering heads. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is often found in temperate climates. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a distinct serrated edge, while its flowers are small and clustered in composite inflorescences. This subspecies is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
