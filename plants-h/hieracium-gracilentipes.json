    "intro": "Hieracium gracilentipes, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in composite inflorescences, typical of the daisy family. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
