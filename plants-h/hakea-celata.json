    "intro": "Hakea celata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and produces distinctive cylindrical or urn-shaped flower spikes. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in drought conditions. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to orange, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Hakea celata is often used in native landscaping due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
