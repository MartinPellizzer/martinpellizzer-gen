    "intro": "Hieracium sericophyllum subsp. hellenicum, commonly known as the Hellenic hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silver- or gray-haired leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
