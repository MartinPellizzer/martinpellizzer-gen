It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and leaves with translucent dots, which give it its common name. The plant is native to Europe and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in herbal medicine."
