    "intro": "Hieracium mutilatiforme, commonly known as the ragged chrysanthemum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It has a short, upright stem with several branches and produces small, inconspicuous florets. Due to its hardy nature, it is often considered a weed but can also be cultivated for ornamental purposes."
