    "intro": "Hoya acicularis, commonly known as the needle hoya, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, thin, needle-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Hoya acicularis is a succulent, meaning it stores water in its leaves and stems, making it drought-tolerant. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
