    "intro": "Helichrysum wollastonii, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers that remain intact even after flowering, giving it a dried floral appearance. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or sandy environments. Its foliage is typically grey-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Helichrysum wollastonii is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
