    "intro": "Haworthia pentagona var. torulosa, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped growth pattern and its distinctive, light green to white tubercles that resemble a zebra's stripes. The leaves are fleshy and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps the plant retain moisture in arid conditions. It produces small, white flowers on tall stems during the warmer months. This variety is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and unique appearance."
