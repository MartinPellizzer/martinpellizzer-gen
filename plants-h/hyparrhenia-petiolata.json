    "intro": "Hyparrhenia petiolata, commonly known as the African grass or red grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves with a reddish hue, especially when young. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Hyparrhenia petiolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional practices and as a source of thatching in some regions."
