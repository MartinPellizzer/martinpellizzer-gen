    "intro": "Hedera jatrophifolia, commonly known as the Jerusalem ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to the Middle East and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a waxy texture and prominent veins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption."
