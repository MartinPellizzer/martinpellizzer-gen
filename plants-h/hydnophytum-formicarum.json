    "intro": "Hydnophytum formicarum, commonly known as the ant plant, is a tropical climbing plant that forms a unique symbiotic relationship with ants. Its hollow, leaf-like structures provide shelter for colonies of ants, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores. The plant's leaves are modified into leaf-like pseudobulbs that house the ant colonies, and it relies on them for defense. It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The ant plant is notable for its specialized morphology and mutualistic ecological interactions."
