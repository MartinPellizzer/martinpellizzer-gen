It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Hadrodemas is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
