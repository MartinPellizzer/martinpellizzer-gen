    "intro": "Hieracium albellipes, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and is characterized by its compact, hairy foliage and bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It produces small, herbaceous stems that bear numerous flowers arranged in a dense cluster. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many areas."
