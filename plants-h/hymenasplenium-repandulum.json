    "intro": "Hymenasplenium repandulum, commonly known as the broadleaf spleenwort, is a member of the family Pterobryaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in moist, shaded environments. The plant features a rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called soridia. Its leaves are usually broad and have a delicate, feathery appearance, contributing to its ornamental value. Hymenasplenium repandulum is often found in temperate regions and is appreciated for its unique botanical structure and ecological role."
