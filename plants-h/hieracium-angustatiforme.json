It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are narrow and often have a rough texture, while its yellow flowers bloom in clusters. It is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
