    "intro": "Hordeum euclaston var. puberulum, commonly known as the hairy wild barley, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense, hairy foliage that distinguishes it from other barley varieties. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often found in moist, well-drained environments. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, each containing two to three bracts. Hordeum euclaston var. puberulum plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
