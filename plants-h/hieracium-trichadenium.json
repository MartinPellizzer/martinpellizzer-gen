It is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant has a creeping growth habit and produces a milky sap when damaged. It is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid spread and adaptability."
