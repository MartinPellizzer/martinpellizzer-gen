    "intro": "Heracleum flavescens var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf cowparn, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and flowering stems. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in moist grasslands and woodland edges. The plant features large, broadly ovate leaves with a distinctive silvery or yellowish underside, which gives it its common name. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family. This variant is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to other varieties within the Heracleum genus."
