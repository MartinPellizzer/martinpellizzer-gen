    "intro": "Hieracium serracadiense, commonly known as the serrated hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and basal rosette of serrated, dark green leaves. The plant produces daisy-like yellow flowers with a central disk surrounded by ray florets. It is native to southern Europe and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
