    "intro": "Hoehnelia, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Polygonaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Hoehnelia species are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their narrow, often spiny leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The flowers are usually pink or red, and the plants are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. They play an important role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
