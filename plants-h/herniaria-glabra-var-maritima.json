    "intro": "Herniaria glabra var. maritima, commonly known as sea sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its small, fleshy, green leaves and produces tiny white or pink flowers. The plant is adapted to salt-laden air and sandy soils, making it a hardy species found in maritime regions. Its succulent leaves help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and is often found in the intertidal zone."
