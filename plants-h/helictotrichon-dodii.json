    "intro": "Helictotrichon dodii, commonly known as the Dod's needlegrass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of northern Mexico. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive blue-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Helictotrichon dodii is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
