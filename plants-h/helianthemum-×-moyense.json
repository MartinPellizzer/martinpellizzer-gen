    "intro": "Helianthemum \u00d7 moyense, commonly known as the hybrid stonecrop, is a low-growing evergreen perennial that belongs to the Crassulaceae family. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on its parent species."
