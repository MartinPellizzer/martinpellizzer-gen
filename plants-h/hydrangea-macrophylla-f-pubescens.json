This variety is notable for its hairy or pubescent foliage, which gives it a distinctive, textured appearance. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained, acidic soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves in autumn, and produces cone-like fruit capsules that contain small seeds. Its blooming period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, adding vibrant color to the landscape."
