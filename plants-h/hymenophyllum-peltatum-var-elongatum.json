    "intro": "Hymenophyllum peltatum var. elongatum, commonly known as the long-leaf haircap, is a fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate, and often elongated leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. This variant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its leaves are usually less than 2 centimeters in length and exhibit a bright green color. The plant reproduces through spores, which are released from the tiny, sporangium-bearing structures located on the underside of the leaves."
