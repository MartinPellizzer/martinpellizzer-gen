    "intro": "Hieracium dalkarlbyense, commonly known as the Dalkarlby hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Nordic region, particularly Sweden. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy areas and is known for its yellow-orange flower heads composed of numerous small florets. It has rough, hairy leaves and produces achenes as its fruit, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native habitat."
