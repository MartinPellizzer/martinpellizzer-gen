    "intro": "Heteropterys anomala f. eglandulosa, commonly known as the glandless heteropterys, is a botanical variant of the species Heteropterys anomala. It is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America, particularly in countries like Brazil and Peru. The plant features elliptical, glossy leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, often displaying a range of colors from white to pink. This form is distinguished by the absence of glandular structures on its leaves, which sets it apart from the typical form of the species."
