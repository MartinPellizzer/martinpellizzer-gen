    "intro": "Hylocereus tricae, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to Central America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are short-lived, typically lasting only a few hours, and are pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths. Hylocereus tricae is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
