    "intro": "Helianthemum marifolium subsp. conquense, commonly known as the Canary Islands rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has woody stems and dense, evergreen foliage that is adapted to the arid, rocky environments of its habitat. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in Mediterranean gardens."
