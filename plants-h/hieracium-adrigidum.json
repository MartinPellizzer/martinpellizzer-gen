    "intro": "Hieracium adrigidum, commonly known as the rigid hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, and its leaves are usually hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern. Hieracium adrigidum is often considered a weed due to its ability to spread rapidly in disturbed environments."
