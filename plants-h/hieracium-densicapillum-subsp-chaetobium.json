It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in the structure of its leaves and bracts."
