    "intro": "Horsfieldia megacarpa, commonly known as the giant fruit orchid, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers and fleshy, berry-like fruits. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with a distinctive lip that attracts pollinators. The fruits, which are edible, develop from the flower and are an important food source for certain wildlife in its native habitat."
