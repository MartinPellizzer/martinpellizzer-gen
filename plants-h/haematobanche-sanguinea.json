    "intro": "Haematobanche sanguinea, commonly known as red root or bloodroot, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant is characterized by its deep red or orange root system, which is rich in alkaloids and has been used in traditional medicine. It is native to regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its parasitic nature and medicinal properties, it plays a significant role in both ecological and ethnobotanical contexts."
