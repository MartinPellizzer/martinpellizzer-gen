    "intro": "Habenaria alexandrae, commonly known as the Alexandra's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, showy flowers that often display a striking combination of colors. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in the humid conditions. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil of its native habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
