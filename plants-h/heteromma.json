    "intro": "Heteromma, commonly known as the green lacewing, is a genus of insects belonging to the family Hemerobiusidae. These insects are characterized by their delicate, lace-like wings and elongated bodies. They are often found in moist environments such as marshes and gardens. Heteromma species play a role in ecological balance by preying on small invertebrates. Their botanical significance lies in their habitat preferences and their contribution to natural pest control in plant ecosystems."
