    "intro": "Hieracium psarodes, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers, which are typically arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. The plant has basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stem is usually hairy as well. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Hieracium psarodes is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
