    "intro": "Howardia foetens, commonly known as the stink lily, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a strong, unpleasant odor when in bloom, which is believed to attract certain pollinators. Howardia foetens is often cultivated for its ornamental value despite its pungent scent."
