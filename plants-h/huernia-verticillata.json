    "intro": "Huernia verticillata, commonly known as the horned African violet, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are usually arranged in a rosette pattern and have a distinctive, almost horn-like appearance. Huernia verticillata is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
