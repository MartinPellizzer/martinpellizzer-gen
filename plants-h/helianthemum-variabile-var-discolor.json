    "intro": "Helianthemum variabile var. discolor, commonly known as the variable rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow, depending on the variety. The plant has succulent, often hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its botanical name reflects its variable appearance and the discoloration of its flowers, which can change as they age."
