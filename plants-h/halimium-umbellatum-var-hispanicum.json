It features small, showy pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has woody stems and hairy leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
