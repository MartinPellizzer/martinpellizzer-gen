    "intro": "Heliotropium dasycarpum var. gymnostomum, commonly known as the woolly heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, fragrant purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are often covered in fine, white to grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is part of the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is known for its ornamental value in gardens."
