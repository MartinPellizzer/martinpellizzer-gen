    "intro": "Hemigraphis javanica, commonly known as the Java nettle or velvetleaf, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily in moist, shaded environments. Hemigraphis javanica is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
