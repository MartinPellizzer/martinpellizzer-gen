    "intro": "Heliocereus \u00d7 violaceus, commonly known as the violet night bloomer cactus, is a hybrid species within the Cactaceae family. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that open at night, typically in shades of violet or white. These flowers are ephemeral, lasting only a few hours, and are pollinated by nocturnal insects. Its unique morphology and nocturnal flowering make it a popular specimen among cactus enthusiasts and botanists alike."
