    "intro": "Hypolepis australis, commonly known as the New Zealand cliff fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, strap-like fronds that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Hypolepis australis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
