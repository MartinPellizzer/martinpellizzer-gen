    "intro": "Hydrilla verticillata, commonly known as waterweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has long, flexible stems that branch at the nodes, forming dense clusters of whorled leaves. The leaves are typically narrow and ribbon-like, with a smooth surface and a pointed tip. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, followed by dark, spherical fruits. Hydrilla is highly invasive and can rapidly colonize water bodies, impacting aquatic ecosystems and water quality."
