    "intro": "Heterosperma xanti var. carterae, commonly known as the Carter's water-milfoil, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface or rise from the substrate. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it both a valuable habitat for aquatic life and a potential invasive species in non-native regions."
