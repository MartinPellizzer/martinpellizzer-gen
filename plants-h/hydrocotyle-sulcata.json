    "intro": "Hydrocotyle sulcata, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland areas in the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early fall. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist soil. Hydrocotyle sulcata plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly as a food source for various insects and birds."
