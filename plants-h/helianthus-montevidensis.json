    "intro": "Helianthus montevidensis, commonly known as the Montevidense sunflower, is a species of flowering plant native to South America, particularly Uruguay and parts of Brazil. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and other sunflowers, and is characterized by its bright yellow ray flowers and a central disk of smaller florets. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in full sunlight. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are sturdy and often branched. Helianthus montevidensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
