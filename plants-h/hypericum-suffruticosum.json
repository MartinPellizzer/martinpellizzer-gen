    "intro": "Hypericum suffruticosum, commonly known as the creeping St. John's wort, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and produces small, yellow flowers with four petals. The plant typically blooms in late summer, from July to September, and is often found in rocky or dry soils. Its leaves are oval-shaped and slightly hairy, and it is known for its medicinal properties, though it is less commonly used than other Hypericum species. The plant's ability to thrive in harsh conditions makes it a hardy addition to gardens and natural landscapes."
