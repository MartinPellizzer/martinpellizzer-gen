    "intro": "Hoya pulgarensis, commonly known as the \"Lunar Night\" hoya, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its waxy, dark green leaves and clusters of star-shaped, white flowers that bloom at night. The plant is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is known for its slow growth and compact form. Hoya pulgarensis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its attractive foliage and unique flowering habit."
