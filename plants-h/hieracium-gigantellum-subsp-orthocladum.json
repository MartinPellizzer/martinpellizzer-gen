    "intro": "Hieracium gigantellum subsp. orthocladum, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has a rosette of basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its stems are upright with opposite leaves. The subspecies orthocladum is distinguished by its more upright growth habit and slightly different leaf morphology compared to other subspecies of Hieracium gigantellum."
