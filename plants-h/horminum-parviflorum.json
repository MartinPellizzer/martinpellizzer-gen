It features delicate, small white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
