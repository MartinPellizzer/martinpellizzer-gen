It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features hairy, serrated leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
