    "intro": "Hammada articulata subsp. scoparia, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and North Africa. It is characterized by its compact, spiny structure and small, fleshy leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
