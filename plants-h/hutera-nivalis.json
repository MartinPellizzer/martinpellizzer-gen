    "intro": "Hutera nivalis, commonly known as the snow orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It features a compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, delicate white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions. Hutera nivalis typically blooms in late spring to early summer, adding a touch of color to snow-covered landscapes. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for alpine ecosystems."
