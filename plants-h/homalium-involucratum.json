    "intro": "Homalium involucratum, commonly known as the velvetleaf or mountain hibiscus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a yellow or red center. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Homalium involucratum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
