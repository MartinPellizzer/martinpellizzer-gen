    "intro": "Haplochorema magnum, commonly known as the giant flame plant, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is characterized by its large, vibrant red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique botanical features make it a popular choice for tropical gardens and conservatories."
