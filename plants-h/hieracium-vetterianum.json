    "intro": "Hieracium vetterianum, commonly known as the Vetter's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow flowers arranged in a composite head. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It has fibrous roots and produces numerous small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in parts of its native range."
