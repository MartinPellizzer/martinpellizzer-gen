    "intro": "Hoarea radiata, commonly known as the radiate hoya, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light. Hoarea radiata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and air-purifying properties."
