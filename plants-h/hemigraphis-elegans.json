    "intro": "Hemigraphis elegans, commonly known as the silver mohair plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It features dense, velvety foliage with a silvery-blue hue on the upper surface and a dark green underside, giving it a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds and container planting. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form a compact, mound-like shape with minimal maintenance."
