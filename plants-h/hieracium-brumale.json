It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are basal, rough, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in late autumn to early spring. Hieracium brumale is known for its ability to thrive in cooler climates and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
