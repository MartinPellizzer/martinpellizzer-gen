    "intro": "Hieracium monnieri subsp. monnieri, commonly known as the lesser hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and flowering stems that bear yellowish to reddish composite flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and meadows, across Europe and parts of Asia. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, oval-shaped achenes as its seeds. Due to its low-growing habit and ability to spread vegetatively, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
