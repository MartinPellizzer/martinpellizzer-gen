    "intro": "Haageocereus versicolor var. lasiacanthus, commonly known as the variegated night-blooming cereus, is a cactus species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that are often sparsely covered with white or pale-blue spines. The plant produces large, showy white or pink flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
