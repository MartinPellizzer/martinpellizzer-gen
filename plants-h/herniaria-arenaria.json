    "intro": "Herniaria arenaria, commonly known as sand-hornet or sandwort, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is native to arid and coastal regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are small, fleshy, and often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Herniaria arenaria is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, including high salinity and low moisture. It plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
