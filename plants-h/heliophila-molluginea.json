    "intro": "Heliophila molluginea, commonly known as the marsh woundwort, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender, often reddish stems that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in loose clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Heliophila molluginea is adapted to moist soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
