    "intro": "Hintonia, commonly known as the yellow bell, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its showy yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sun. Hintonia has simple, alternate leaves and produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly cultivated. Its botanical features make it an attractive addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
