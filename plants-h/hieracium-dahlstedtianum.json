    "intro": "Hieracium dahlstedtianum, commonly known as the Dahlstedt's hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Central and Eastern Europe and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and other open, sunny habitats. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and its flowers are arranged in a single inflorescence at the top of the stem. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
