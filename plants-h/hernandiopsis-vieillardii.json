It is native to the rainforests of South America, particularly in Guyana and Venezuela. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically elliptical and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, berry-like fruits. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
