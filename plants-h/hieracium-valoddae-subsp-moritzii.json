    "intro": "Hieracium valoddae subsp. moritzii, commonly known as the Moritz's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has hairy stems and leaves with a rough texture, and its flowers are arranged in a flat, disk-like head. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
