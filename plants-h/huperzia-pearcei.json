It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its leaves are typically elongated and have a leathery texture, contributing to its resilience in humid conditions. The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
