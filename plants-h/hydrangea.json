    "intro": "Hydrangea, commonly known as the bigleaf hydrangea, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Hydrangeaceae. These plants are characterized by their large, showy clusters of flowers that can range in color from white to pink, blue, or even red, depending on soil pH. Hydrangeas are native to East Asia and are widely cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with broad, serrated leaves that provide a lush green backdrop to their colorful blooms. The flowers are produced in inflorescences called mopheads or lacecaps, which can be either rounded or flat, depending on the species."
