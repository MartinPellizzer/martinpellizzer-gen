    "intro": "Hedyotis canadensis, commonly known as Canadian pennywort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features small, opposite leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces tiny, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often resembling a cluster of pearls. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its habitat."
