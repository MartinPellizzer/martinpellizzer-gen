    "intro": "Halesia corymbosa, commonly known as the white fringe tree, is a deciduous flowering tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, white, pendulous flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The tree has smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Halesia corymbosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
