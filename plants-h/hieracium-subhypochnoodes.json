    "intro": "Hieracium subhypochnoodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native vegetation and alter local ecosystems."
