    "intro": "Hoya obcordata, commonly known as the wax plant or the sweetheart plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apocynaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of star-shaped flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tropical rainforests. Hoya obcordata produces fragrant, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in low light make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
