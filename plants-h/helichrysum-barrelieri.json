It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its showy, yellow-orange flower heads that resemble small sunflowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that mature into fluffy, dry seed heads, which are often used in floral arrangements. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Helichrysum barrelieri is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
