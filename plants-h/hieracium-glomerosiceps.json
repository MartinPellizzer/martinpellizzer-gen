    "intro": "Hieracium glomerosiceps, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit and produces numerous small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense cluster at the top of the stem. The plant has hairy leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in dry environments. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grasslands. Hieracium glomerosiceps is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in agricultural areas."
