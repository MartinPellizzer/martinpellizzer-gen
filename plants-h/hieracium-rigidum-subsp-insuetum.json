    "intro": "Hieracium rigidum subsp. insuetum, commonly known as the rigid hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features upright, hairy stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture. Its flowers are yellow, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and are characteristic of the Asteraceae family. The subspecies insuetum is distinguished by its more rigid stem and smaller, more compact flowers compared to other subspecies of Hieracium."
