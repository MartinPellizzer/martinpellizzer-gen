It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and leafy basal rosette. The plant features dark green, woolly leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are typically yellow and arranged in a dense, compact inflorescence. Hieracium densifloccum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can form dense colonies due to its rhizomatous growth habit."
