    "intro": "Hieracium onosmoides subsp. geisenheyneri, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense mats or cushions. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth form and is often found in mountainous habitats across the Alps."
