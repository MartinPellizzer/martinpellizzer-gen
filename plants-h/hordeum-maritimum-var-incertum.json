    "intro": "Hordeum maritimum var. incertum, commonly known as sea barley, is a coastal plant adapted to saline and sandy environments. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with bract-like structures that help protect the reproductive organs. Its leaves are narrow and have a waxy coating, reducing water loss in arid conditions. This variety is often found in dune ecosystems and plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils."
