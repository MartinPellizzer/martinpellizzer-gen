    "intro": "Havardia brevifolia, commonly known as the velvetwood tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and distinctive, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. The tree is also valued for its ability to withstand drought conditions once established."
