    "intro": "Helianthemum grandiflorum var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. This plant is valued for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
