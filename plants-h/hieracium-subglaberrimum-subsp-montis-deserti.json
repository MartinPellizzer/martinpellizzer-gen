    "intro": "Hieracium subglaberrimum subsp. montis-deserti, commonly known as the Desert Mountain Hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range."
