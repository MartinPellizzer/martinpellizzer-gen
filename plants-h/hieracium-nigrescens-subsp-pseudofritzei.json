    "intro": "Hieracium nigrescens subsp. pseudofritzei, commonly known as the black ragwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dark green, rough leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and meadows, and can reach heights of up to 60 cm. It has a taproot system and produces achenes as its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its potential toxicity, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
