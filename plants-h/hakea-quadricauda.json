    "intro": "Hakea quadricauda, commonly known as the four-tailed hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, cylindrical, woody stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces bright red or orange flower spikes during the spring and summer months, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Hakea quadricauda is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and heathland habitats."
