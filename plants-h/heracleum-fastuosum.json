    "intro": "Heracleum fastuosum, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It can grow up to 5 meters in height, with large, umbrella-like white flowers and deeply lobed leaves. The plant contains phototoxic sap that can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and roadsides. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
