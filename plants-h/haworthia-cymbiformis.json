    "intro": "Haworthia cymbiformis, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color with white or pale markings. The leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern and are covered in small, translucent windows that allow light to penetrate to the chlorophyll layers. It produces tall, branched flower stalks with white or yellow flowers during the summer months. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
