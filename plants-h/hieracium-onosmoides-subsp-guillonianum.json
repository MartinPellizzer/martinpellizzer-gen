    "intro": "Hieracium onosmoides subsp. guillonianum, commonly known as the Guillon's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
