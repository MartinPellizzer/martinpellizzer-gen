    "intro": "Hieracium neorupicola, commonly known as the rock hawksbeard, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its yellow-orange flower heads consist of numerous small florets arranged in a disk shape, surrounded by bracts. Hieracium neorupicola is adapted to harsh environments, with a low-growing habit and hairy leaves that help reduce water loss."
