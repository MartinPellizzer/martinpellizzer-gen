    "intro": "Hieracium marylandicum var. pseudopaniculatum, commonly known as the Maryland hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellowish to orange composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, and it has a creeping growth habit with hairy stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while the flowers are arranged in a flat-topped cluster. This variety is distinguished by its slightly branched inflorescence, which gives it a more open appearance compared to other hawkweed species."
