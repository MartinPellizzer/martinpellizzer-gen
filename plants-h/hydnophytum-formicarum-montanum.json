    "intro": "Hydnophytum formicarum montanum, commonly known as the ant plant, is a tropical epiphytic species belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its unique structure, with hollow stems that serve as shelter for ants, which in turn provide protection against herbivores. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with certain ant species, particularly those of the genus Pheidole, which reside within its stem cavities. Its leaves are typically elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. This plant is native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia and is often found growing on tree branches in humid, shaded environments."
