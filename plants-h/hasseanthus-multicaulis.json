    "intro": "Hasseanthus multicaulis, commonly known as the purple sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub with slender, branched stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Hasseanthus multicaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and dry landscapes."
