    "intro": "Hieranthemum, commonly known as the shrub cineraria, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to southern Europe, North Africa, and the Mediterranean region. They are characterized by their evergreen foliage and showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to blue and purple. Hieranthemum species are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their hardiness and ability to thrive in coastal and rocky environments. They are also valued for their use in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
