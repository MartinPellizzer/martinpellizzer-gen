It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters. The plant has a hairy stem and is typically found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native flora in certain habitats."
