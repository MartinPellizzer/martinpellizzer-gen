    "intro": "Hypericum monanthemum subsp. monanthemum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers with prominent orange\u817a\u4f53 (glands) at the base of the petals. These flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, woodland habitats."
