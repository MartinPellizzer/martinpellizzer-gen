    "intro": "Haplophyllum laristanicum, commonly known as the Laristan mountain germander, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey and northern Iran. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
