    "intro": "Heliotropium thymoides, commonly known as the thyme-leaved heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its aromatic, thyme-scented leaves and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed habitats. Its flowers are typically visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance. Heliotropium thymoides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
