    "intro": "Hedera grandifolia, commonly known as the giant ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to eastern Asia. It features dark green, lobed leaves that are larger than those of most other ivy species, often reaching up to 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions if not properly managed."
