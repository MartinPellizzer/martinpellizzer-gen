    "intro": "Habenaria periyarensis, commonly known as the Periyar orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and linear to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which are typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in dense forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
