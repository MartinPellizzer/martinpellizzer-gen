    "intro": "Hydrangea macrophylla f. caerulea, commonly known as the blue hydrangea, is a cultivar prized for its vibrant blue flower clusters. The coloration of its flowers is influenced by soil pH, with acidic soil producing blue hues and alkaline soil resulting in pink or red tones. This variety is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters. It features large, showy inflorescences composed of sterile flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in partial shade and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil for optimal growth."
