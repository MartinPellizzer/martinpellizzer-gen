    "intro": "Halostachys caspica var. belangeriana, commonly known as the Caspian saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss through transpiration. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate extreme climates."
