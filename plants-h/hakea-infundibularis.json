It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. Its woody structure and ability to thrive in sandy soils make it well adapted to its arid environment. Hakea infundibularis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits in native gardens."
