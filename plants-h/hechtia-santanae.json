    "intro": "Hechtia santanae, commonly known as the Santana's hechtia, is a species of flowering plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, emerging from the center of the rosette. Hechtia santanae is adapted to grow in rocky or well-drained soil, often in sunny to partially shaded environments."
