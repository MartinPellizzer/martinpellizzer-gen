    "intro": "Habenaria ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Rwenzori Mountains in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing in rocky or forested areas. The plant features a pseudobulb with a single leaf and produces striking, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. Its floral structure is typical of the Orchidaceae family, with three sepals and three petals, and a distinctive lip. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
