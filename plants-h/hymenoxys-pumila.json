    "intro": "Hymenoxys pumila, commonly known as the Mexican daisy, is a small, flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and other composite flowers. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, gray-green leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or arid environments. Hymenoxys pumila is adapted to dry conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
