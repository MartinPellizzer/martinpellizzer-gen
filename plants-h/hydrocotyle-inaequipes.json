    "intro": "Hydrocotyle inaequipes, commonly known as the unequal-leaved water arum, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and striking spatulate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as marshes and along stream banks. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. The flowers are usually greenish-white and are surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe."
