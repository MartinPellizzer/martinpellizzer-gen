    "intro": "Homoioceltis aspera, commonly known as the rough homoioceltis, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to the Mediterranean region, this plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is often found in rocky or coastal areas, where it demonstrates a high degree of adaptability. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly observed in its natural habitat."
