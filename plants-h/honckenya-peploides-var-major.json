    "intro": "Honckenya peploides var. major, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It features a dense mat of silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, silky hairs that reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. This adaptation makes it well-suited for harsh, dry environments."
