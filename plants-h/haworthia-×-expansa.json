    "intro": "Haworthia \u00d7 expansa, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a hybrid succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves that are often marked with distinctive white or yellowish markings resembling a zebra's stripes. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or yellow during the growing season. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
