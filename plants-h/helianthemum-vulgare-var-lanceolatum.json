It features small, rounded leaves that are typically lance-shaped, giving it its specific epithet. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in spring, which are followed by small, rounded fruits. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland regions with mild climates. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
