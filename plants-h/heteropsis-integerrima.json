    "intro": "Heteropsis integerrima, commonly known as the rock rose, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are typically small, leathery, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. Heteropsis integerrima is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
