    "intro": "Habracanthus erythranthus, commonly known as the red-flowered habracanthus, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking red or orange tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
