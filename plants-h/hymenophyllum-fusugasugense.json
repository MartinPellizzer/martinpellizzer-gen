    "intro": "Hymenophyllum fusugasugense, commonly known as the New Zealand rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically growing on rocks or tree trunks in shaded areas. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This species is valued for its unique appearance and ecological role in New Zealand's forest ecosystems."
