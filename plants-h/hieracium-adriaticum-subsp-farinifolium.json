    "intro": "Hieracium adriaticum subsp. farinifolium, commonly known as Adriatic hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula. It features basal leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving them a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
