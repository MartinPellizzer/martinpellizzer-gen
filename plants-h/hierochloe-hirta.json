    "intro": "Hierochloe hirta, commonly known as hairy hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with red or purple. Hierochloe hirta plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
