    "intro": "Hieracium gracile subsp. myosotidifolium, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, hairy stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. This subspecies is distinguished by its delicate foliage, which resembles that of the forget-me-not plant."
