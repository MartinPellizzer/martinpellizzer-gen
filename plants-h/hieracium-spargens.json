    "intro": "Hieracium spargens, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces yellow flowers with ray florets, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It has a creeping growth habit with hairy stems and leaves that are lance-shaped and often have a fuzzy texture. Hieracium spargens is sometimes considered a weed due to its ability to spread rapidly and colonize various habitats."
