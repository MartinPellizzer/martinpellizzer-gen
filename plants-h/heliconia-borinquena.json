    "intro": "Heliconia borinquena, commonly known as the Puerto Rican heliconia, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the Heliconiaceae family and is characterized by its large, brightly colored bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that are typically hidden within the bracts. Its robust rhizomes allow it to thrive in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests and wetlands. Heliconia borinquena plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various pollinators and wildlife."
