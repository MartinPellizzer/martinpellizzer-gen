    "intro": "Habenaria elliotii, commonly known as Elliot's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its leaves are usually linear and arranged in a rosette, and the flowers are often white or pale pink with intricate patterns. This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
