    "intro": "Heteroderis leucocephala, commonly known as the white-headed nematode, is a species of plant-parasitic nematode. It belongs to the family Heteroderidae and is characterized by its distinctive white head and elongated body. This nematode primarily infects the roots of various host plants, causing significant damage to crops such as soybeans and cotton. Its life cycle involves a free-living stage followed by a parasitic stage, during which it feeds on plant cells. The botanical impact of Heteroderis leucocephala is largely negative, as it reduces plant growth and yield through root galling and nutrient depletion."
