    "intro": "Himantandra parvifolia, commonly known as the Hawaiian lady's mantle, is a flowering plant native to the island of Oahu in Hawaii. It is a member of the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its dense, palmate leaves that form a rosette shape. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
