    "intro": "Hypochaeris maculata subsp. uniflora, commonly known as the white hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its yellow flowers with a central dark center and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and disturbed soils, preferring full sun. It produces small, elongated seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds, aiding in its spread. This species is often considered a weed but has ornamental value due to its bright, daisy-like appearance."
