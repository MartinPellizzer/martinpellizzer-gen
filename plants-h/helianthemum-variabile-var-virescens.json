    "intro": "Helianthemum variabile var. virescens, commonly known as the green-flowered rock rose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features dense clusters of small, bright green flowers that contrast with its gray-green foliage. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for coastal and Mediterranean climates. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. It is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
