It features heart-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist or aquatic environments. Hydrocotyle dux is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams."
