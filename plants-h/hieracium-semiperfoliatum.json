    "intro": "Hieracium semiperfoliatum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are often toothed or lobed, and it produces yellow flowers in clusters. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has a creeping growth habit with stolons that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Hieracium semiperfoliatum is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its invasive nature."
