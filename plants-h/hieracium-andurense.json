    "intro": "Hieracium andurense, commonly known as the Andurian hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas. The plant produces yellow to orange composite flowers, which are composed of many small florets arranged in a flattened head. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. Hieracium andurense is adapted to cold climates and has a relatively short growing season."
