    "intro": "Haumaniastrum graminifolium, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to hot, dry environments and has a deep root system to access water. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xerophytic conditions and it is often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
