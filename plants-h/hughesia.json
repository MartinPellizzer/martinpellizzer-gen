    "intro": "Hughesia, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants typically have soft, succulent leaves and produce showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white. Hughesia species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value. They thrive in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making them suitable for desert gardens."
