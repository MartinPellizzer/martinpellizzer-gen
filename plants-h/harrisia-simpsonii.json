    "intro": "Harrisia simpsonii, commonly known as Simpson's nightshade, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces red, fleshy fruits that are edible but have a mildly toxic taste. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
