    "intro": "Hymenocallis palusvirensis, commonly known as the green swamp lily, is a rare and striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the wetlands of Central America, particularly in regions of Mexico and Guatemala. The plant features tall, slender stems with large, showy white or pale green flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, adapted to thrive in moist, swampy environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
