    "intro": "Hieracium centrotum, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers consist of yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale green to white ray flowers. Hieracium centrotum is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
