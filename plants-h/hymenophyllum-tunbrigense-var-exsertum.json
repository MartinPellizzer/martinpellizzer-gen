    "intro": "Hymenophyllum tunbrigense var. exsertum, commonly known as the exserted maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern characterized by its unique leaf morphology. It is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The leaves are delicate and lanceolate, with a finely divided structure that enhances its ornamental appeal. The spores are produced on the underside of the leaves in specialized structures called sorus. This variety is prized for its intricate foliage and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant due to its specific care requirements."
