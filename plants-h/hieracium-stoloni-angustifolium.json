    "intro": "Hieracium stoloni-angustifolium, commonly known as the slender-stoloniferous hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. It produces yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer, and its stolons allow it to spread vegetatively. The narrow, lance-shaped leaves are usually hairy and arranged alternately along the stem."
