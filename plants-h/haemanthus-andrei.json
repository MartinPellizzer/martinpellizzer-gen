    "intro": "Haemanthus andrei, commonly known as the Cape tulip, is a bulbous plant native to South Africa. It produces striking, bright red flowers that resemble tulips, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are evergreen and persist through the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its ability to naturalize and form dense clusters over time."
