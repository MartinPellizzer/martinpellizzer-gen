    "intro": "Haplopappus glutinosus var. illinitus, commonly known as the sticky globemallow, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that are often sticky to the touch. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by fluffy, white to grayish pappus structures that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to drought conditions and contribute to its ecological role in native plant communities."
