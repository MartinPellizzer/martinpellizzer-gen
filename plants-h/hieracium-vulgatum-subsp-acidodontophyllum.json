    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. acidodontophyllum, commonly known as the acid-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. The plant has basal and stem leaves that are lanceolate to ovate, with a rough, hairy texture. Its flowers are yellow, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and bloom from late spring to early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its acidic leaf composition, which contributes to its specific ecological preferences and interactions."
