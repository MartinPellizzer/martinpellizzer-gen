    "intro": "Hermas gigantea, commonly known as the giant hermas, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, fleshy leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically bright yellow or orange in color. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hermas gigantea is often cultivated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
