    "intro": "Habroneuron radicans, commonly known as the climbing nightshade, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems that twine around supporting structures as it grows. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by berries that turn from yellow to red as they mature. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture with a slightly hairy surface. While not widely cultivated, it is sometimes found in moist, shaded areas of forests and is considered a minor weed in some regions."
