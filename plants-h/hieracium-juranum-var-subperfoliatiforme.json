    "intro": "Hieracium juranum var. subperfoliatiforme, commonly known as the subperfoliate hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Its leaves are basal, with a distinctive subperfoliate arrangement where the leaf base partially encircles the stem. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its role in pollinator habitats."
