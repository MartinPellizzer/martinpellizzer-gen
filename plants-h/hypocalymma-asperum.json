    "intro": "Hypocalymma asperum, commonly known as the rough hypocalymma, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a rough, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Hypocalymma asperum is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to survive in low-water conditions."
