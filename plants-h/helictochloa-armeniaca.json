    "intro": "Helictochloa armeniaca, commonly known as Armenian needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Helictochloa armeniaca is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native environments."
