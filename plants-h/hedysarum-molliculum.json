    "intro": "Hedysarum molliculum, commonly known as silky vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by slender, pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed sites. Hedysarum molliculum plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
