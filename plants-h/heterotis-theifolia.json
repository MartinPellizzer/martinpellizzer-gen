    "intro": "Heterotis theifolia, commonly known as the thief's leaf, is a climbing plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often marked with dark veins, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes. Its stems are woody and can grow quite long, allowing it to climb and spread across other vegetation. Heterotis theifolia is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along riverbanks."
