    "intro": "Hieracium proximum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the daisy family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and along stream banks, preferring temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often reddish in color. Hieracium proximum is an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native plants due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production."
