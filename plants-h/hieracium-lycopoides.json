    "intro": "Hieracium lycopoides, commonly known as the false hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Hieracium lycopoides is considered a weed in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit."
