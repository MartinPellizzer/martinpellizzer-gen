It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow ray flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Hieracium sparsivestitum is often found in temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia."
