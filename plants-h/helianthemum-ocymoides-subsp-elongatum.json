    "intro": "Helianthemum ocymoides subsp. elongatum, commonly known as the elongated rockrose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has dense, wiry stems and small, leathery leaves that are adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. It is often found in sunny, arid environments such as coastal cliffs and limestone slopes. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
