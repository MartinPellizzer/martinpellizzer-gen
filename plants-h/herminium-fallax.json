    "intro": "Herminium fallax, commonly known as the autumn spider orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, spider-like flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a distinctive hooded structure, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Herminium fallax is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
