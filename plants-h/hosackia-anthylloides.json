It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in open prairies and disturbed soils, and it has a deep root system that helps it thrive in dry conditions. Its trifoliate leaves and pod-like fruits are typical of the legume family, and it plays an important role in soil nitrogen fixation."
