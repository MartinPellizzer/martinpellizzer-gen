    "intro": "Hieracium morteysense, commonly known as the death's-head hawkmoth plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive black spot at the base, resembling a skull, which gives it its common name. Native to southern Europe, it thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open woodlands. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its botanical features make it a notable species for both ecological and ornamental purposes."
