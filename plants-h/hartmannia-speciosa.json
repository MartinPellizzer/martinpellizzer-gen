    "intro": "Hartmannia speciosa, commonly known as the showy orchid, is a species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a terrestrial orchid with a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that store water, adapting to its humid, shaded habitat. The plant produces striking, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive hooded labellum, which is a key feature in its pollination strategy. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires high humidity and indirect light. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation and study."
