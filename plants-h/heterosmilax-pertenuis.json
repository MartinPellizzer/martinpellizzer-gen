    "intro": "Heterosmilax pertenuis, commonly known as the slender swamp lily, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wet, acidic soils along the edges of swamps and marshes. The plant features a rhizomatous stem system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are narrow, elongated, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The showy white or pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators."
