It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers. The plant is known for its distinctive leaves, which are often covered in small, raised spots or glands. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
