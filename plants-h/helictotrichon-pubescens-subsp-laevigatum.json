    "intro": "Helictotrichon pubescens subsp. laevigatum, commonly known as the smooth hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves that are generally smooth and less hairy compared to other members of the species. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its botanical features make it an important component of grassland ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
