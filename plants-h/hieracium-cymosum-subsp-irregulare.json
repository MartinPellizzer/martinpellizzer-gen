    "intro": "Hieracium cymosum subsp. irregulare, commonly known as the irregular hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are basal and have a rough, hairy texture, while the flowers are yellow with ray florets. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
