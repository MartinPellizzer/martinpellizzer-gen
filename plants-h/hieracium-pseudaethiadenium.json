    "intro": "Hieracium pseudaethiadenium, commonly known as the Ethiopian hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats at elevations above 2,500 meters. It produces yellow to orange flower heads that consist of numerous small florets, and its leaves are usually hairy and lance-shaped. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
