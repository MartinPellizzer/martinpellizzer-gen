It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems that often bear a distinctive coral-like appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in summer. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. Huernia humpatana is well-suited for arid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
