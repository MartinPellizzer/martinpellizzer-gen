It is characterized by its distinctive, wavy-edged, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are broadly lance-shaped with a rough, hairy texture, and the stems are usually hairy as well. Hieracium undulatum is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it is often found in temperate regions."
