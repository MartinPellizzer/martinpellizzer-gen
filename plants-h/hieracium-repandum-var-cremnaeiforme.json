    "intro": "Hieracium repandum var. cremnaeiforme, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit, with numerous flowering stems that produce small, yellowish to reddish composite flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides. This variant is notable for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive."
