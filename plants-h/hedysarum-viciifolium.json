    "intro": "Hedysarum viciifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved pea or viciifoliate locoweed, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its compound leaves with broad, oval leaflets and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to violet. The plant produces pods containing several small, rounded seeds, and it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Hedysarum viciifolium has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and it is often found in association with other drought-tolerant flora."
