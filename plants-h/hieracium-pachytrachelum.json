    "intro": "Hieracium pachytrachelum, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a robust root system and can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, making it a dominant species in its habitat. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are hairy and often reddish in color. Hieracium pachytrachelum is known for its ability to spread aggressively, often forming dense colonies that can outcompete native vegetation."
