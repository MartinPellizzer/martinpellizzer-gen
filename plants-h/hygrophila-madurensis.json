It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as marshes and ponds. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the rainy season. Hygrophila madurensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in aquariums due to its adaptability and aesthetic qualities."
