    "intro": "Hicorius porcina var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy bolete, is a variant of the bolete mushroom characterized by its distinctive hairy cap and stem. It is a medium to large fungus with a cap that ranges from 5 to 20 cm in diameter, often reddish-brown in color when mature. The stem is typically pale with a ring near the base, and the pores are yellowish, fading to brown with age. This mushroom is found in temperate forests, often growing in association with coniferous and deciduous trees. It is edible but should be prepared carefully to avoid any potential digestive issues."
