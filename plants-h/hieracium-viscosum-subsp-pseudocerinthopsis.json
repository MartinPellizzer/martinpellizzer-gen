    "intro": "Hieracium viscosum subsp. pseudocerinthopsis, commonly known as the sticky hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which contribute to its sticky texture. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along roadsides. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
