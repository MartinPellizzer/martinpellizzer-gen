It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It is adapted to arid conditions and is often found in regions with limited rainfall. Helictotrichon tauricum plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native range."
