    "intro": "Hieracium hybridum var. bifurcum, commonly known as the bifurcate hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring basal rosettes of leaves and flowering stems with yellow disk flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it an invasive species in some regions."
