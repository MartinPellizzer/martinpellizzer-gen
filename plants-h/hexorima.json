    "intro": "Hexorima, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and striking, bioluminescent flowers that glow faintly in the dark. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Its unique appearance and elusive nature have made it a subject of fascination among botanists and plant enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Hexorima is now critically endangered and protected in several conservation programs."
