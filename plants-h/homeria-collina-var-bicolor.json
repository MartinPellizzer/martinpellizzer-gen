It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its striking, bi-colored flowers that typically display a combination of white and pink hues. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky outcrops. Its foliage consists of narrow, evergreen leaves that are densely packed, providing a lush green backdrop to its vibrant blooms.
