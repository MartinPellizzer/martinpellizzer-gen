    "intro": "Hieracium bangii, commonly known as the Bangi hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and has hairy stems with serrated leaves. Its flowers are yellow and produce small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium bangii is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
