    "intro": "Hohenbergia guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan hohenbergia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to Central America, particularly Guatemala, and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces striking inflorescences with clusters of small, colorful flowers that range from white to pink or red. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hohenbergia guatemalensis is popular among bromeliad enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
