It features bright yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant has basal and stem leaves that are typically lance-shaped with serrated edges. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
