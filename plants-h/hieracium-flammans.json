It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces bright orange to red flowers that are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Hieracium flammans is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some areas."
