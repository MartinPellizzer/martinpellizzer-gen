    "intro": "Hieracium auriculatum, commonly known as the auriculate hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces yellow flowers in a single head, which are surrounded by a ring of pale green or white phyllaries. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
