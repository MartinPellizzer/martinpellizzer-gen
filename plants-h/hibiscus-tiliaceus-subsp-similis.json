    "intro": "Hibiscus tiliaceus subsp. similis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hibiscus, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom throughout the year in warm climates. Its fibrous roots and sturdy branches make it adaptable to coastal and sandy soils. It is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and hardiness."
