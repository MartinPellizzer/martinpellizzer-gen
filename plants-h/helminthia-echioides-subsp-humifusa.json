    "intro": "Helminthia echioides subsp. humifusa, commonly known as the woolly blueweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, often glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its subspecies distinction is based on differences in leaf morphology and flowering characteristics compared to other subspecies of Helminthia echioides."
