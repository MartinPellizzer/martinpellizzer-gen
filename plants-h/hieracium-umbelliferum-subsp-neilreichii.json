    "intro": "Hieracium umbelliferum subsp. neilreichii, commonly known as the Neilreich's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering head that produces yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
