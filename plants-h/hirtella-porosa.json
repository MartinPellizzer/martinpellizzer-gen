    "intro": "Hirtella porosa, commonly known as the hairy hirtella, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, hairy glands. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers, which are often accompanied by a strong, aromatic scent. Hirtella porosa is typically found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and is often used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and conservation efforts in its native habitat."
