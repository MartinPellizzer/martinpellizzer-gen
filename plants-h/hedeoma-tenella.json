    "intro": "Hedeoma tenella, commonly known as narrowleaf ironweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in prairies, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and it has a fibrous root system. Hedeoma tenella is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
