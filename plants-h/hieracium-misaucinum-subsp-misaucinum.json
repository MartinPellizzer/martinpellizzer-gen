    "intro": "Hieracium misaucinum subsp. misaucinum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and is native to parts of Europe and western Asia. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense patches. Its leaves are generally lance-shaped with hairy surfaces, and it produces achenes that are dispersed by wind. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
