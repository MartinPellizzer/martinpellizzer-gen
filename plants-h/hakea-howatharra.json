    "intro": "Hakea howatharra, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the southern coast of Western Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces cylindrical, woody fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a fibrous, honey-scented coating. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal heathlands. Hakea howatharra is valued for its ecological role in supporting native wildlife and its ornamental appeal in gardens."
