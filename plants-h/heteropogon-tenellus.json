    "intro": "Heteropogon tenellus, commonly known as the slender tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry culms that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown glumes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy surface that distinguishes it from similar species. Heteropogon tenellus is typically found in grasslands and open woodlands, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
