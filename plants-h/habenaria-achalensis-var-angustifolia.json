    "intro": "Habenaria achalensis var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, pale green to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its flowers have a delicate fragrance and are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features and limited distribution."
