    "intro": "Hieracium furvicolor, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer, are surrounded by pale green to reddish bracts, giving it a distinctive appearance. Hieracium furvicolor is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid spread and competitive growth habit."
