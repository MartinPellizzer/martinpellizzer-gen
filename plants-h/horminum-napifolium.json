    "intro": "Horminum napifolium, commonly known as the leafy fern, is a perennial plant native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that grow in a spiral pattern along its stem. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are typically light green and have a slightly waxy texture. Horminum napifolium is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying properties."
