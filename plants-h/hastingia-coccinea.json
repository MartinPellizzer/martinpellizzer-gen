    "intro": "Hastingia coccinea, commonly known as the red hawser, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red, bract-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax. Hastingia coccinea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
