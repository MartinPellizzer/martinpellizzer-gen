    "intro": "Huernia barbata var. tubata, commonly known as the tubercled moon cactus, is a succulent native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its swollen, fleshy stems that are often covered in small, rounded tubercles. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green or blue-green foliage. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
