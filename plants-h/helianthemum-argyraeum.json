    "intro": "Helianthemum argyraeum, commonly known as silver thyme or silver mat thyme, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with silvery-white undersides and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its aromatic leaves release a subtle scent when crushed, and it is drought-tolerant once established. Helianthemum argyraeum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in Mediterranean climates."
