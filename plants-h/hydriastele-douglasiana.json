    "intro": "Hydriastele douglasiana, commonly known as the Douglas's hydriastele, is a rare and unique member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Ecuador, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. The plant is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect moisture from the air. Its flowers, which are typically white or pale blue, are borne on a slender stem and are adapted for pollination by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
