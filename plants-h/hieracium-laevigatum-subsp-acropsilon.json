    "intro": "Hieracium laevigatum subsp. acropsilon, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and can form dense colonies. The plant has basal leaves that are broadly ovate to heart-shaped, with a hairy surface, and produces yellow flowers in early summer. Its flowering stems are usually taller than the leaves, and the flowers are arranged in a single, terminal head. The species is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, and it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
