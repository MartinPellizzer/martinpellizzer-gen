It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive rostrated (beak-shaped) fruits. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with compound leaves and small, white flowers. Its botanical features include a woody stem, opposite leaf arrangement, and clustered inflorescences. Hetaeria rostrata is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and potential ecological roles in its native habitat."
