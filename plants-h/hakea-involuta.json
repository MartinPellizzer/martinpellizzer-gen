    "intro": "Hakea involuta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces striking, bottle-shaped yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. Its flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly honeyeaters, which are attracted to its nectar. Hakea involuta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
