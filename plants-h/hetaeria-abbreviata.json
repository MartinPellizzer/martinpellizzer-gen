    "intro": "Hetaeria abbreviata, commonly known as the small-leaf hetaeria, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
