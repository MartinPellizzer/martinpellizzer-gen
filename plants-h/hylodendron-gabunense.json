It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, showy red flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, and it produces woody capsules as its fruit. Hylodendron gabunense is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
