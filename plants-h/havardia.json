    "intro": "Havardia, commonly known as the flame tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly South America. The plant is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange flowers that appear in clusters, often resembling flames. Havardia species are typically deciduous, shedding their leaves during dry seasons, and they can grow as trees or shrubs. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in warm climates with well-drained soil."
