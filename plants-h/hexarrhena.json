    "intro": "Hexarrhena, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its nocturnal blooming habit, with large, showy white flowers that open at night. The flowers emit a strong, sweet fragrance to attract pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with smooth, often thornless stems. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, often with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments."
