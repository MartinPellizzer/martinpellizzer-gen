    "intro": "Hieracium montis-florum subsp. soldanoi, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are generally lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, and it produces a distinctive seed head that disperses its seeds by wind. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its ecological adaptations to harsh mountain environments."
