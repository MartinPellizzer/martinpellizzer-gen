    "intro": "Helianthus annuus var. niveus, commonly known as the white sunflower, is a variant of the common sunflower characterized by its white or pale yellow flower heads instead of the typical orange. This variety is notable for its reduced pigmentation in the ray florets, which gives it a distinctive appearance compared to other helianthuses. It is native to the southeastern United States and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. The plant produces a tall, sturdy stem with large, heart-shaped leaves. While less common in cultivation, it is appreciated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
