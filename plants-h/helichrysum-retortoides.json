    "intro": "Helichrysum retortoides, commonly known as the golden crown, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that remain vibrant even when dried. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with narrow, silvery-green leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to retain color and form when dried, often used in floral arrangements."
