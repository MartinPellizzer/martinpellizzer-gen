    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. subpapyraceum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. The leaves are typically linear to lanceolate, with a rough or hairy surface, and they tend to be more narrow compared to other hawkweed species. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and thrives in temperate climates. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
