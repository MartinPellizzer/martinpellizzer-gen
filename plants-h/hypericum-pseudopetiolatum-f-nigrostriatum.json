    "intro": "Hypericum pseudopetiolatum f. nigrostriatum, commonly known as the black-striped St. John's wort, is a unique variant of the St. John's wort genus. It is characterized by its striking dark red to black veins on the leaves, which contrast with its typically yellow floral structures. This plant is native to the southeastern United States and thrives in moist, acidic soils. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The foliage is often used in herbal remedies, though its medicinal properties are less well-documented compared to other Hypericum species."
