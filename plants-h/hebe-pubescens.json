    "intro": "Hebe pubescens, commonly known as the downy hebe, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its hairy, or pubescent, stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, typically in spring or summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Hebe pubescens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
