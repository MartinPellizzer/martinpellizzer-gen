    "intro": "Hieracium griseovirens, commonly known as the grey-green hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and basal rosettes of spoon-shaped, grey-green leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in composite heads, which are typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. Due to its invasive potential, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
