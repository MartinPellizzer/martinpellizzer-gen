    "intro": "Helianthus laciniatus subsp. crenatus, commonly known as the curlyleaf sunflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it its common name, and its flowers are typically yellow with a central disk. The plant produces numerous small, yellow ray florets surrounding a composite flower head. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its botanical structure supports its role in ecological systems, providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
