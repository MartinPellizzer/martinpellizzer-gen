    "intro": "Hieracium parvulum, commonly known as the lesser hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with erect, hairy stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, oval leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are typically arranged in a single head. Native to Europe, it is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
