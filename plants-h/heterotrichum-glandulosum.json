    "intro": "Heterotrichum glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant has small, elongated leaves that are typically covered with glandular structures, which may aid in water retention. It reproduces through spores, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and a sporophyte stage. Heterotrichum glandulosum is a relatively uncommon species, often requiring specific microhabitat conditions for successful growth."
