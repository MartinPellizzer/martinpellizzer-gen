    "intro": "Helianthemum vineale var. canum, commonly known as the creeping sunflower or sand mat, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, helping it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to xeriscapes and native plant gardens."
