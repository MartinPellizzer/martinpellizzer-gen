    "intro": "Halophila ovalis var. major, commonly known as the giant seagrass, is a marine flowering plant found in tropical and subtropical coastal waters. It is characterized by its long, ribbon-like leaves and is typically found in shallow, sandy or muddy substrates. The plant plays a crucial role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various marine organisms. It has a complex root system that helps in nutrient absorption and oxygenation of the surrounding water. Halophila ovalis var. major is also an important component of seagrass meadows, which support high biodiversity in marine ecosystems."
