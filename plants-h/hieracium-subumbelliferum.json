    "intro": "Hieracium subumbelliferum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its bright yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and the leaves are usually basal, with a rough, hairy texture. Hieracium subumbelliferum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
