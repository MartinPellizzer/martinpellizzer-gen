It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow leaves are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Hierochloe hookeri plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife in its native range."
