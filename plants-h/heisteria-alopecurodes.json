It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant has a dense, mat-forming habit with hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Heisteria alopecurodes thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or woodland settings."
