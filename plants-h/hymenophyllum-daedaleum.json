    "intro": "Hymenophyllum daedaleum, commonly known as the fairy moss, is a small, delicate fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. This plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology includes a creeping rhizome and small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves. Hymenophyllum daedaleum is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks, where it forms dense, carpet-like mats."
