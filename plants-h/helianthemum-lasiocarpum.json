    "intro": "Helianthemum lasiocarpum, commonly known as the woolly rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
