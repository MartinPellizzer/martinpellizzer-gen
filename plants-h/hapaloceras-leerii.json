    "intro": "Hapaloceras leerii, commonly known as the slender swamp fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its reproductive structures include sori that are clustered along the undersides of the fronds. Hapaloceras leerii plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of wetland habitats by providing shelter and food for various microorganisms and small aquatic life."
