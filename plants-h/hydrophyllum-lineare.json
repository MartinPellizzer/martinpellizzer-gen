    "intro": "Hydrophyllum lineare, commonly known as slenderleaf waterleaf, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. Its foliage is typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Hydrophyllum lineare plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to the specific ecological conditions of its habitat."
