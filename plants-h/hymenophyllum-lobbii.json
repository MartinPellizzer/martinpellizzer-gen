    "intro": "Hymenophyllum lobbii, commonly known as the New Zealand rock fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the Hymenophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in humid climates. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, which are covered in a layer of fine, hair-like structures. Hymenophyllum lobbii is known for its ability to tolerate low light and high humidity, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
