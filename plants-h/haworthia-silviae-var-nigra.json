It features dense, fleshy leaves arranged in a rosette, often with a dark green to almost black coloration due to its high concentration of chlorophyll. The leaves are typically adorned with white or light green markings, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or indoor cultivation. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
