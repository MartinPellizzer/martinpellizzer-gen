    "intro": "Hymenaea correana, commonly known as the yellow rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release flat, winged seeds. The wood of Hymenaea correana is highly valued for its density and rich golden color, making it a sought-after material in traditional craftsmanship."
