    "intro": "Hieracium bremangerense, commonly known as the Bremanger hawkweed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Norway, specifically the Bremanger area. The plant is characterized by its rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
