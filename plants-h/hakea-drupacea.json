    "intro": "Hakea drupacea, commonly known as the red hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its woody, spine-tipped leaves and clusters of bright red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces hard, woody fruits called drupes, which contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy pulp. Hakea drupacea is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for coastal and sandy soils. Its unique appearance and ecological importance make it a notable species in native landscaping and conservation efforts."
