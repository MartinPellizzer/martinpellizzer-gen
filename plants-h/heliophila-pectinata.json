    "intro": "Heliophila pectinata, commonly known as the woolly water star, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, fluffy, white flowers that resemble small stars, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, woolly appearance. It thrives in moist soil and is often found near water bodies such as ponds and streams. Heliophila pectinata is typically perennial and plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
