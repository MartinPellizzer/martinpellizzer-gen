    "intro": "Hoya fauziana subsp. angulata, commonly known as the \"Clove Hoya,\" is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its waxy, ovate leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers with a sweet, clove-like fragrance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
