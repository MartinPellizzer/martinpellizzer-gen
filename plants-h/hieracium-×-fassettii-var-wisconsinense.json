It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in certain habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland conservation."
