    "intro": "Hieracium laevigatum subsp. lissolepium, commonly known as the smooth hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features basal and stem leaves that are broadly lanceolate with smooth margins, and it produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. Its inflorescence consists of a single, flat-topped head of small florets, characteristic of the Asteraceae family. The subspecies is distinguished by its finely hairy stems and smaller, more compact leaves compared to other hawkweed species."
