    "intro": "Hierochloe sachalinensis, commonly known as the Sakhalin bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Asia, including parts of Russia and Japan. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
