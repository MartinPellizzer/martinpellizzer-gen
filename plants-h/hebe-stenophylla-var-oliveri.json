    "intro": "Hebe stenophylla var. oliveri, commonly known as the Oliver's hebe, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green color, often with a slight blue or silver hue. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, typically in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract native pollinators such as bees and birds."
