    "intro": "Hedera hibernica, commonly known as the Irish ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to western Europe. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a waxy texture and serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stone walls. Hedera hibernica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to cover vertical surfaces in gardens."
