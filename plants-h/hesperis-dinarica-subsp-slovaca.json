It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in alpine or subalpine regions. It has linear to lanceolate leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological adaptations."
