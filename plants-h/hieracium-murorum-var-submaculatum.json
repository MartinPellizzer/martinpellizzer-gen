    "intro": "Hieracium murorum var. submaculatum, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that are often spotted with white or pale markings. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions."
