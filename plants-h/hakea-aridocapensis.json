    "intro": "Hakea aridocapensis, commonly known as the sandplain hakea, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, spinose foliage and cylindrical, woody fruits that contain seeds. The plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and can tolerate extreme drought conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in summer, and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Hakea aridocapensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat in its native environment."
