    "intro": "Hydriastele aprica, commonly known as the golden hydriastele, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers with intricate patterns, which bloom during the warmer months. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and elongated, often with a waxy texture that aids in moisture retention. Hydriastele aprica requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
