    "intro": "Hieracium eriphaeum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow daisy-like flowers with a central disk. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. Hieracium eriphaeum is often found in disturbed soils and can form dense colonies, making it a notable weed in some areas."
