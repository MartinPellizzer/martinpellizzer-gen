It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Heliophila katbergensis thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun exposure, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
