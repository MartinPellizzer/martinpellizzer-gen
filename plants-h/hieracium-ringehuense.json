    "intro": "Hieracium ringehuense, commonly known as the Ringehuense Hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in dense clusters. Native to New Zealand, this species is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both sunny and partially shaded environments. The plant is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
