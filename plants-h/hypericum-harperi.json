    "intro": "Hypericum harperi, commonly known as the Harpers' St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and features bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, orange-red fruits that are attractive to birds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature."
