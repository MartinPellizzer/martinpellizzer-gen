    "intro": "Humboltia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf sea holly, is a small, flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique, spiny leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Humboltia pusilla thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to withstand salt spray and coastal winds. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
