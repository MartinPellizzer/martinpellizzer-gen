    "intro": "Hebeandra parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered hebe, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white down. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, which bloom from late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy and adaptable plant for gardens. Hebeandra parviflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as part of native plant collections."
