    "intro": "Helianthemum racemosum, commonly known as the clustered stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in summer, typically arranged in a raceme, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal make it a popular plant among gardeners in Mediterranean climates."
