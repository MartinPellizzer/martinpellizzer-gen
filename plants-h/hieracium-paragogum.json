    "intro": "Hieracium paragogum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can form dense mats due to its spreading rhizomes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium paragogum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
