    "intro": "Hedysarum varium subsp. varium, commonly known as the variable pea vine, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with stipules. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by narrow, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along woodland edges. Hedysarum varium subsp. varium is valued for its ornamental appeal and nitrogen-fixing abilities, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
