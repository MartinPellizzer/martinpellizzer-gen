    "intro": "Hypericum reptans subsp. reptans, commonly known as creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features prostrate or semi-upright stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across ground surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with four petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are woody and often reddish in color. This species is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
