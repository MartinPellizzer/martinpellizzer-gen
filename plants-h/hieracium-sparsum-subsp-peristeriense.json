    "intro": "Hieracium sparsum subsp. peristeriense, commonly known as the Greek hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in a single terminal head. It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and medicinal properties in some species."
