    "intro": "Hamamelis hyemalis, commonly known as the winter honeylocust, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, fragrant, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has opposite, simple, and serrated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds. Hamamelis hyemalis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
