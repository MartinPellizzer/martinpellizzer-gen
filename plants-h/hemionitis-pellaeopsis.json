    "intro": "Hemionitis pellaeopsis, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are often covered in fine, translucent hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in shaded crevices. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important subject in botanical studies. Due to its sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
