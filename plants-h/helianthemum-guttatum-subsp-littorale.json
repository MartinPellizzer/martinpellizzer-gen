It typically thrives in sandy or rocky coastal environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh, maritime conditions. The plant features small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate touch to its rugged habitat. Its leaves are usually hairy and covered in glandular dots, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is often found in dunes and coastal cliffs, playing a role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity."
