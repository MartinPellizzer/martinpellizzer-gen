The plant has a hairy stem and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It is known for its aggressive growth and can form dense colonies, making it a common weed in agricultural areas. Its leaves and stems are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions."
