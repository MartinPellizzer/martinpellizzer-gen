    "intro": "Heracleum villosum, commonly known as cow parsnip, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its large, umbrella-like compound leaves and tall, hollow stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered umbels, which are followed by oval, brownish seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and roadside areas. Due to its sap, which can cause skin irritation, it is considered a potentially toxic plant."
