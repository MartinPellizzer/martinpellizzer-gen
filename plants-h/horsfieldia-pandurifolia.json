    "intro": "Horsfieldia pandurifolia, commonly known as the pandurifolia orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elongated, strap-like leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, relying on its roots for attachment rather than soil. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pale yellow, bloom in clusters and are often visited by insects. Horsfieldia pandurifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
