    "intro": "Hypericum subalpinum var. parviflorum, commonly known as the alpine St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically features small, yellow flowers with prominent orange stamens, which bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand cold and harsh mountain conditions. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant."
