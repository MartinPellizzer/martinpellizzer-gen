    "intro": "Hepatica acutiloba f. plena, commonly known as the showy hepatica, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its early spring blooms of delicate, three-petaled flowers in shades of white, pink, and blue. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is known for its ability to bloom before many other spring flowers. The f. plena form is distinguished by its more abundant and showy flower clusters compared to the typical form."
