    "intro": "Hieracium comigerum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow ray florets surrounded by tubular disk florets. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. It produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread. Hieracium comigerum is often considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
