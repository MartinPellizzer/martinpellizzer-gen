    "intro": "Hildaea pallens, commonly known as the silverleaf hildaea, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hildaea pallens is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in full sun with minimal water."
