    "intro": "Hakea ambigua, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern and western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical or cylindrical-branching stems and its distinctive, recurved leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, red or orange flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Hakea ambigua is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
