    "intro": "Humboltia aspasicensis, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family, characterized by its climbing habit and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces vibrant blue or purple blooms that open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline, often growing in areas with strong ocean winds. Humboltia aspasicensis plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of its coastal habitat."
