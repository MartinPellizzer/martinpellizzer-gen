    "intro": "Hieracium amauron, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and the plant has hairy stems and leaves with a rough texture. Hieracium amauron is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
