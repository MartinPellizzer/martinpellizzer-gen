    "intro": "Helianthemum \u00d7 triregnorum, commonly known as the hybrid rock rose, is a flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is a natural hybrid between Helianthemum nummularium and Helianthemum montanum, resulting in a shrub with dense, low-growing foliage. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils in Mediterranean climates, thriving in full sun. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
