    "intro": "Hieracium pinnatifidum subsp. subpunctillatum, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrowly lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
