    "intro": "Humularia chevalieri, commonly known as the chevalier's bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in temperate climates. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers during the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
