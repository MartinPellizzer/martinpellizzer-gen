    "intro": "Hieracium incanum subsp. akinfiewii, commonly known as the pale hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and basal rosettes of gray-green, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
