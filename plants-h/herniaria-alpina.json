    "intro": "Herniaria alpina, commonly known as alpine pennywort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It has small, rounded leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh alpine environments. The plant produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Herniaria alpina is known for its resilience to cold temperatures and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
