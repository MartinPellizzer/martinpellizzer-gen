    "intro": "Haplopappus linearifolius subsp. interior, commonly known as the interior linearleaf hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb with a low-growing, mat-forming habit, characterized by its linear, often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers arranged in a single head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments and contribute to its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
