    "intro": "Hieracium cylopodum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and disturbed soils, forming dense mats with upright stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium cylopodum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit and ability to spread rapidly."
