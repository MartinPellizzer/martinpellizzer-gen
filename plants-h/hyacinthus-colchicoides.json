It produces clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers in early spring. The plant has strap-shaped leaves that are often mistaken for grass due to their appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and ease of cultivation."
