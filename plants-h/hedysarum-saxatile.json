    "intro": "Hedysarum saxatile, commonly known as the alpine vetch, is a perennial legume native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Hedysarum saxatile is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits surrounding vegetation."
