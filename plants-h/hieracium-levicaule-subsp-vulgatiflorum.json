    "intro": "Hieracium levicaule subsp. vulgatiflorum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves and produces numerous small, dandelion-like seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
