    "intro": "Hieracium praecox subsp. foetidum, commonly known as stinking hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces a strong, unpleasant odor, which is likely a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its subspecies status reflects subtle differences in morphology and habitat preference compared to other Hieracium species."
