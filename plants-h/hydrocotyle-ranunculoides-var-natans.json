    "intro": "Hydrocotyle ranunculoides var. natans, commonly known as floating pennywort, is a semi-aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in shallow freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that float on the water, with small, white flowers emerging from the leaf axils. Its rapid growth rate makes it an aggressive invader in non-native regions, often outcompeting native aquatic vegetation. Botanically, it is characterized by its rhizomatous growth and ability to reproduce both sexually and vegetatively."
