    "intro": "Hieracium orthoprenanthes, commonly known as the upright hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellowish-green flowering heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring well-drained conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are clustered in a single head surrounded by bracts. Hieracium orthoprenanthes is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
