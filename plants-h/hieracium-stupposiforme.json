It belongs to the dandelion family (Compositae) and is characterized by its yellow flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun. Its leaves are hairy and have a serrated edge, while its stems are upright and often branched. The flowers are followed by seed heads that release small, wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its spread."
