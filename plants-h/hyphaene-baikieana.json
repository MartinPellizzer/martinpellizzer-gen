It is characterized by its massive, buttressed trunk and can reach heights of up to 25 meters. The plant has a fibrous, spongy trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Its leaves are palmate, with multiple leaflets, and it produces large, yellowish flowers that develop into edible fruits. The plant plays a significant ecological and cultural role in its native regions."
