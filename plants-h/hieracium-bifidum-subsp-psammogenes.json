    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. psammogenes, commonly known as the sand dune hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to sandy coastal areas of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silver-haired leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. Its subspecific name, *psammogenes*, refers to its association with sandy habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local insect populations."
