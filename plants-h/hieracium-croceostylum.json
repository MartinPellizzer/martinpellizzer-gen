    "intro": "Hieracium croceostylum, commonly known as the yellow-stemmed hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its yellowish-green stems are often covered in fine hairs, and the flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Hieracium croceostylum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some areas."
