    "intro": "Hesperocyparis goveniana var. abramsiana, commonly known as the Abrams' incense cedar, is a rare and endemic conifer native to specific regions of California. It is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown bark and scale-like leaves that are tightly packed on the branches. The tree produces small, round cones that mature to a dark brown color, containing winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
