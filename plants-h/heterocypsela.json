    "intro": "Heterocypsela, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their composite flower heads, which consist of both ray and disk flowers. The fruit, known as a cypsela, is typically dry and contains a pappus for wind dispersal. Heterocypsela species are often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils across temperate regions. They play a role in supporting pollinators and contribute to the ecological diversity of their habitats."
