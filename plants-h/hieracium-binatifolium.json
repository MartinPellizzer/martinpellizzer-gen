It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a cluster.
