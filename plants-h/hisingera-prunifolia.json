    "intro": "Hisingera prunifolia, commonly known as the roseleaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a prominent yellow or red throat. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hisingera prunifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
