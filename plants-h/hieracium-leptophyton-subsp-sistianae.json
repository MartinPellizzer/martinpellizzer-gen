    "intro": "Hieracium leptophyton subsp. sistianae, commonly known as the Sistiana hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of the Eastern Alps. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and clustered, yellowish to reddish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in open, sunny habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in parts of its range."
