    "intro": "Hibiscus smilacifolius, commonly known as the climbing hibiscus, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the warmer months. Its fibrous stems are strong and can climb using tendrils, making it a common ornamental plant in humid climates. Hibiscus smilacifolius is also valued for its ability to thrive in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
