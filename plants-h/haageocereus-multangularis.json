It is a solitary, columnar cactus with a ribbed, angular stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has areoles that bear both spines and flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments."
