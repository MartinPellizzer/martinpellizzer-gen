    "intro": "Hoya linusii, commonly known as the silver star hoya, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of star-shaped flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid tropical environments. Its foliage is typically variegated with silver and green tones, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Hoya linusii prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, with minimal watering to prevent root rot."
