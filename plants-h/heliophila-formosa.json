    "intro": "Heliophila formosa, commonly known as the yellow water violet, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. The plant has slender, often floating stems and heart-shaped leaves that are usually submerged or floating on the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Heliophila formosa plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
