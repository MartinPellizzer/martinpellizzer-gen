    "intro": "Hieracium bauhini subsp. pseudotransgressum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands. It has a creeping growth habit, with stolons that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
