    "intro": "Hymenophyllum portoricense, commonly known as the Atlantic spleenworts, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like fronds that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sorocarps, are clustered in small, cup-like formations on the underside of the fronds. This species is notable for its high degree of morphological variation and its adaptation to specific microhabitats."
