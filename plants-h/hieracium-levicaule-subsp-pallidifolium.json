    "intro": "Hieracium levicaule subsp. pallidifolium, commonly known as the pale-leaved hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, pale green leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in the summer. Its inflorescence consists of a single flower head with ray florets and a central disk of tubular flowers. It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions."
