    "intro": "Hieracium balbisianum subsp. pseudohumile, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant features dark green, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. It is characterized by its relatively short stature and is often found in moist or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
