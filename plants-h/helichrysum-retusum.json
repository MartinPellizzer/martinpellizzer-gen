    "intro": "Helichrysum retusum, commonly known as the rough everlasting or yellow everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that produces small, bright yellow to orange flowers, which are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy, often glandular leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Helichrysum retusum is also valued for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
