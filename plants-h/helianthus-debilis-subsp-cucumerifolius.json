The plant produces yellow-orange composite flowers with ray florets surrounding a central disk, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
