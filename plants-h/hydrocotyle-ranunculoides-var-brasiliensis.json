    "intro": "Hydrocotyle ranunculoides var. brasiliensis, commonly known as Brazilian water shield, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-10 cm in diameter, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, making it both a common and sometimes invasive species in aquatic habitats."
