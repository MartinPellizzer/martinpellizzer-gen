    "intro": "Hieracium pseudoexpallidum, commonly known as the pale false hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It is often mistaken for other hawkweed species due to its similar appearance."
