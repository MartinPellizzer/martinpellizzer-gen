    "intro": "Hemizygia canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf hemizygia, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, white hairs, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Hemizygia canescens is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
