    "intro": "Hiraea fagifolia f. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved hiraea, is a rare and unique variant of the hiraea genus. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often longer than those of the typical species. The plant is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in spring, and are usually white or pale green. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
