    "intro": "Halothamnus iranicus, commonly known as the Iranian spiny saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and small, fleshy leaves adapted to water conservation. The plant thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it a common species in desert and steppe ecosystems. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, contributing to its role in local pollination networks. Halothamnus iranicus is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in harsh environments."
