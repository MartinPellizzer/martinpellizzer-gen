    "intro": "Hieracium pinnatibifidum, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features a rosette of broadly ovate, hairy leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are typically yellow, with ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. Hieracium pinnatibifidum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can spread aggressively through its rhizomes."
