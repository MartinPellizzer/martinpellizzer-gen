    "intro": "Hakea scoparia, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, often spiny foliage and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has adapted to sandy soils and salty coastal winds, making it resilient to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Hakea scoparia plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
