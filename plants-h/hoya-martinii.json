    "intro": "Hoya martinii, commonly known as the \"Coral Hoya,\" is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, often resembling coral in appearance. Hoya martinii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
