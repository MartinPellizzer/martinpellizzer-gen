    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. euchlorum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are broadly lanceolate and covered with fine hairs, and its flowering stems bear yellow to orange flowers arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces small, oval-shaped achenes that are often adorned with pappus hairs for wind dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often forming dense mats. Botanically, it is distinguished by its yellow flowers and the presence of glandular dots on its leaves."
