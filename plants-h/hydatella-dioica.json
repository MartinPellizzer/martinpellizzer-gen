    "intro": "Hydatella dioica, commonly known as the water lily of the genus Hydatella, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Australia. It is characterized by its floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that open in the morning. The plant has a short, stout stem with roots that anchor it in the muddy substrate of still or slow-moving water bodies. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, with a prominent yellow center, and it produces small, round fruits that disperse by water. Hydatella dioica plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
