    "intro": "Hydrolythrum wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as lakes and streams. The plant has thin, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor waters and is often found in mountainous areas with high altitude and low temperatures. Hydrolythrum wallichii plays a minor but important role in the ecological balance of its habitat."
