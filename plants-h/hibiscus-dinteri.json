    "intro": "Hibiscus dinteri, commonly known as the Desert Hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Namibia and Angola. It is characterized by its striking, large, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a red or purple throat. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves and stems that help it retain water in its harsh environment. Hibiscus dinteri is adapted to extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly insects and birds."
