    "intro": "Hieracium tapeinocephalum, commonly known as the narrow-headed hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with a distinctive central disk. Hieracium tapeinocephalum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
