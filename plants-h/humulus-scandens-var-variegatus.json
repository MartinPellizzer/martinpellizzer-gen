    "intro": "Humulus scandens var. variegatus, commonly known as the variegated hop vine, is a vigorous climbing plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, lobed leaves that display striking variegation of green, white, and yellow. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically not used for brewing but are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil. Due to its rapid growth, it is often used as a decorative vine in gardens or for covering trellises."
