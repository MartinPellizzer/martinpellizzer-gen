    "intro": "Hieracium monoticum, commonly known as the single-stem hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring a single stem that is often hairy and upright. Its flowers are yellow and occur in clusters, forming a composite head that resembles a dandelion. Hieracium monoticum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
