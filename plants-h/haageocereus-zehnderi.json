It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems and produces large, fragrant white flowers at night. The plant is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for desert conditions. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening only during the night and closing by dawn. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil."
