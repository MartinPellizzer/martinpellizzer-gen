    "intro": "Herminium lijiangense, commonly known as the Lijiang orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, spurred flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its flowers, which are usually greenish-yellow with purple markings, bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Herminium lijiangense is considered a vulnerable species."
