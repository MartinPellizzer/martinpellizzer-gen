    "intro": "Hieracium luroense, commonly known as the Luroense hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grasslands and disturbed areas, thriving in temperate climates. It features basal leaves that are often hairy and lance-shaped, with yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native vegetation and is sometimes considered a weed."
