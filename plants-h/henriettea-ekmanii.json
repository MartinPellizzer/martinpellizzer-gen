    "intro": "Henriettea ekmanii, commonly known as the Ecuadorean starflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Onagraceae, which includes species such as willows and evening primroses. The plant is characterized by its star-shaped, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Henriettea ekmanii is typically found in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
