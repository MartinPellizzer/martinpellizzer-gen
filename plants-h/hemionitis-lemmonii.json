    "intro": "Hemionitis lemmonii, commonly known as the Lemmon's hemionitis, is a rare and delicate fern native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Hemionitidaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in desert environments where it can withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant adaptation to harsh climates. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Hemionitis lemmonii is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
