    "intro": "Herpestis vandellioides, commonly known as the dwarf sand-verbena, is a low-growing annual herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically reaches a height of less than 10 centimeters, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
