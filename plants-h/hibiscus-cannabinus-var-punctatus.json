    "intro": "Hibiscus cannabinus var. punctatus, commonly known as the spiked hibiscus, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant produces a fibrous, woody stem that is often used in traditional crafts and construction. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. The variety 'punctatus' is distinguished by the presence of small, spiky protrusions on its leaves, giving it a unique appearance."
