    "intro": "Helianthemum guttatum var. villosissimum, commonly known as the woolly rockrose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features dense, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are typically clustered in branched inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
