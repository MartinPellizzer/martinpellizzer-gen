    "intro": "Hygrophila bengalensis, commonly known as the Indian water plant or water hyssop, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in wetland environments and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and spikes of small, fragrant flowers. The plant is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of slow-moving streams. Its flowers are typically blue to purple in color and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hygrophila bengalensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
