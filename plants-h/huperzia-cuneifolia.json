    "intro": "Huperzia cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its simple, linear leaves that are often arranged in a dense, tufted cluster at the base. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporophytes produce spores on the underside of the leaves, which are dispersed by wind. Huperzia cuneifolia is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
