    "intro": "Hydnora aethiopica, commonly known as the African starwood, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It grows exclusively on the roots of certain host plants, primarily in the Karoo region of South Africa. The plant produces a distinctive, fleshy, reddish structure that resembles a star, which is adapted for attracting pollinators. Its flowers are pollinated by flies, which are drawn to its strong, unpleasant odor. Due to its unique biology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
