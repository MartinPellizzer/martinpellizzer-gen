    "intro": "Hieracium melanops subsp. pseudopraeustum, commonly known as the black hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and along stream banks. It has a creeping rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Due to its aggressive growth, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
