    "intro": "Hieracium internatum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the daisy family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in some regions."
