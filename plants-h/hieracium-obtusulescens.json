    "intro": "Hieracium obtusulescens, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a rough texture, and its flowers are yellow with a central disc. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
