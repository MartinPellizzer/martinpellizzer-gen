    "intro": "Hyparrhenia vulpina subsp. longipes, commonly known as the long-awned lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often reach heights of 30 to 100 cm. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and the inflorescence consists of a single, elongated spikelet. It produces small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated, and the plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. This species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and its resilience to drought."
