    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 grypaeum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a hybrid perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which are typically daisy-like and composed of ray florets. The plant produces a basal rosette of leaves that are typically hairy and have a rough texture. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a noxious weed in certain regions."
