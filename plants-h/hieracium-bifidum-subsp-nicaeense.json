    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. nicaeense, commonly known as the Nicaean hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in parts of its native range."
