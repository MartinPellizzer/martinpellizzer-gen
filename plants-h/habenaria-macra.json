    "intro": "Habenaria macra, commonly known as the large-lobed orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its intricate, spurred petals and a distinctive lip that aids in pollination. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and greenhouse cultivation."
