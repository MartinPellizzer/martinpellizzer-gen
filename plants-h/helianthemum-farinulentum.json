It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has gray-green, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
