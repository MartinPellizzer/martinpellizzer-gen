    "intro": "Hieracium angustellum, commonly known as narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are surrounded by pale green bracts. Its leaves are narrow and often have a fuzzy texture, and it is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes. Hieracium angustellum is considered a weed in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit."
