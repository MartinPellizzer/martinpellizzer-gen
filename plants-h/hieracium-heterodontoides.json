    "intro": "Hieracium heterodontoides, commonly known as the rough hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. Its leaves are rough and hairy, with a distinctive lobed shape, and its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium heterodontoides is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators in its native environment."
