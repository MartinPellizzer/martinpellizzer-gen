    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. atricomum, commonly known as the black-centered hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and waste areas. The plant features dark green, basal leaves that are broadly lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, with dark brown to black central florets. It is characterized by its distinctive black center, which gives it its common name and sets it apart from other hawkweed species."
