    "intro": "Hedysarum omissum, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne in clusters along the stems. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense colonies, making it a valuable plant for erosion control. Hedysarum omissum is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
