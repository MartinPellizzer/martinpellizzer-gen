    "intro": "Hornungia alpina, commonly known as the alpine hornungia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense cushions or mats, which help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, providing insulation against freezing temperatures. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. Hornungia alpina is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in areas with strong winds and short growing seasons."
