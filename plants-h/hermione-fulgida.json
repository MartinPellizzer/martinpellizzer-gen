    "intro": "Hermione fulgida, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant orange and yellow petals, which resemble a glowing flame, and its unique, intricate floral structure. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often emitting a subtle fragrance. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
