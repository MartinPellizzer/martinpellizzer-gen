    "intro": "Helianthemum krockeri, commonly known as the rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Helianthemum krockeri is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens."
