    "intro": "Hortia oreadica, commonly known as the mountain hortia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and produces small, showy blue or violet flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Hortia oreadica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable climates."
