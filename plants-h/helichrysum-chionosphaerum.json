It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of small, yellow to golden flowers that resemble a snowball, hence its common name. The plant has narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Helichrysum chionosphaerum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
