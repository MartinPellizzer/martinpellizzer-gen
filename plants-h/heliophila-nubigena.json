    "intro": "Heliophila nubigena, commonly known as the cloud-loving heliophila, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in high-altitude, cloud-covered environments. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as mountain meadows and rocky slopes where sunlight is limited. The plant possesses small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed to maximize light absorption in low-light conditions. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, with five petals that bloom in early summer. Heliophila nubigena plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil in its fragile alpine ecosystem."
