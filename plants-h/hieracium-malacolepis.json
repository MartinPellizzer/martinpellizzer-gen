    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracius malacolepis, commonly known as the sticky hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant is recognized for its rough, hairy stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a sticky substance, which can deter herbivores and aid in seed dispersal. Hieracium malacolepis is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates."
