    "intro": "Hampea, commonly known as the \"sicklepod\" or \"bottlepod,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, pod-like fruits that often resemble small bottles or sickles, which aid in seed dispersal. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They have compound leaves and produce small, often yellow or white flowers. Hampea species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
