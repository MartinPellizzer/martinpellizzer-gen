    "intro": "Hydnora sinandevu, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Hydnoraceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of woody plants. The plant is notable for its unique, fleshy, reddish or yellowish flower that resembles a meaty structure, which attracts flies for pollination. It is native to southern Africa and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its specialized lifestyle and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and enigmatic species in the botanical world."
