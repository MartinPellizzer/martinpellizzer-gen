    "intro": "Heldreichia bupleurifolia var. subtriloba, commonly known as the three-lobed bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lanceolate leaves with three distinct lobes. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
