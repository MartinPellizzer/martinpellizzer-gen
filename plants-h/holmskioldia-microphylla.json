    "intro": "Holmskioldia microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf yellow bell, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, yellow-orange tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the dry season. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and grows as a shrub or small tree, often reaching heights of up to 3 meters. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely available in commercial horticulture."
