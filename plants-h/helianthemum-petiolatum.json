It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its fleshy, evergreen leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry habitats. It is drought-tolerant and prefers full sun exposure, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance in its native range."
