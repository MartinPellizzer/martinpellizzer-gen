    "intro": "Haworthia herbacea, commonly known as the Zebra plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, pointed leaves that are often marked with white or yellow markings resembling a zebra's stripes. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light. It produces small, greenish-white flowers on tall stems during the summer months. Its compact size and unique appearance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
