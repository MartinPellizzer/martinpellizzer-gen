    "intro": "Helichrysum stoechas var. serotinum, commonly known as the late-flowering helichrysum, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer to autumn, giving it its common name. The plant has wiry, gray-green foliage and produces papery, persistent bracts that remain after the flowers fade. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
