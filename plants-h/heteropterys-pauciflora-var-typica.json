    "intro": "Heteropterys pauciflora var. typica, commonly known as the rare mountain hibiscus, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically divided into 5-7 lobes, and its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
