    "intro": "Harmogia corynophylla, commonly known as the Australian sandalwood, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, woody stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its seeds are enclosed in woody capsules that split open to release the seeds. Harmogia corynophylla is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments and is often found in sandy soils."
