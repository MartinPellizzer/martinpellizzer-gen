    "intro": "Heterotheca stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaf goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss. Its yellow flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Heterotheca stenophylla is adapted to arid environments and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems."
