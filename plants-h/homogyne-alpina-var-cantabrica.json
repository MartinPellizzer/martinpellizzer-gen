    "intro": "Homogyne alpina var. cantabrica, commonly known as the Cantabrian alpine homogyne, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of northern Spain. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves.

Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
