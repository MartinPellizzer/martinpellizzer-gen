    "intro": "Henningsocarpum viscosum, commonly known as the sticky fruit plant, is a unique species within the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its viscid, sticky fruits that adhere to the skin and clothing, a feature that aids in seed dispersal. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid environments. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Despite its unusual characteristics, it is not widely cultivated for commercial purposes."
