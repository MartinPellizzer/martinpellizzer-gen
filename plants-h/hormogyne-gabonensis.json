    "intro": "Hormogyne gabonensis, commonly known as the Gabon orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and West Africa. It is a terrestrial herb with a rhizomatous structure, often found in moist, shaded forest understories. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with a unique structure that includes a spurred labellum, typical of many orchids. Its growth is closely associated with specific soil conditions and humidity levels, making it a sensitive indicator of ecosystem health. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in its native range."
