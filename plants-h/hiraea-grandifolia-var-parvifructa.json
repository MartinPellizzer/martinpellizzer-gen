    "intro": "Hiraea grandifolia var. parvifructa, commonly known as the small-fruited hiraea, is a rare and lesser-known plant species within the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by small, fleshy fruits that are a distinguishing feature of this variety. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
