    "intro": "Hymenolepis revoluta, commonly known as the curled liver fluke, is a parasitic flatworm belonging to the family Hymenolepididae. It primarily infects the liver of various mammals, including rodents, and is characterized by its distinctive, curled morphology. The adult fluke has a complex life cycle involving intermediate hosts, such as beetles, and definitive hosts, where it resides in the bile ducts. Its body is covered with a cuticle and possesses a ventral sucker for attachment. The plant-like appearance of its body, with a central axis and lateral branches, is a key feature in its classification within the class Trematoda."
