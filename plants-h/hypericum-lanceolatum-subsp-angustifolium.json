The plant produces small, yellow flowers with prominent orange\u817a\u4f53 (glands) that are typical of the Hypericaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open woodlands and rocky slopes. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used historically for its purported healing benefits."
