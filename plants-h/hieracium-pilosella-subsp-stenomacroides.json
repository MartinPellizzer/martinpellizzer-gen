    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. stenomacroides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and serrated leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in composite flower heads, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
