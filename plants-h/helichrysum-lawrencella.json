It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that are often mistaken for leaves due to their compact arrangement. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. The foliage is often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture."
