    "intro": "Heuchera roseola, commonly known as the rose-flowered coral bells, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking foliage, which ranges from deep red to purple hues. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that are typically pink or rose-colored, blooming in late spring to early summer. Heuchera roseola thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
