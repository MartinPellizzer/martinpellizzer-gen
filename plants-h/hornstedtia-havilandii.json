    "intro": "Hornstedtia havilandii, commonly known as the Haviland's hornstem, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and delicate, fern-like leaves that give it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Native to the southwestern United States, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
