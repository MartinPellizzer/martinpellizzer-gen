    "intro": "Hieracium subacanthum, commonly known as the rough hawkweed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow composite flowers, which are composed of many small florets. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine, stiff hairs, contributing to its rough texture. Hieracium subacanthum is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
