    "intro": "Hyoscyamus orientalis, commonly known as the oriental henbane, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is an annual herb that grows up to 1 meter tall, with erect, branched stems and alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its seeds are contained in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. The plant contains toxic alkaloids and has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a hallucinogen."
