    "intro": "Hebe angustissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hebe, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Hebe angustissima is also valued for its hardiness and ability to attract native pollinators."
