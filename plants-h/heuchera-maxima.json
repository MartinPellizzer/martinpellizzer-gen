    "intro": "Heuchera maxima, commonly known as the giant alumroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 12 inches in diameter, often displaying vibrant shades of red, purple, and green. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are borne on tall, upright stems. Heuchera maxima thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental foliage makes it a valuable addition to shade gardens, though it is less commonly cultivated than other heuchera species."
