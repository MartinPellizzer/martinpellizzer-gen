    "intro": "Heterotoma tonelii, commonly known as the Tonelli's heterotoma, is a species of flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae, which includes bellflowers and related genera. The plant is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that typically display shades of blue or violet. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a hairy texture, which helps in reducing water loss in its native habitat. Heterotoma tonelii is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and limited distribution."
