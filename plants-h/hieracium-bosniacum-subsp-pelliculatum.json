    "intro": "Hieracium bosniacum subsp. pelliculatum, commonly known as the Bosnian hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe, particularly Bosnia and Herzegovina. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and along stream banks. It has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into fluffy seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range."
