    "intro": "Himantoglossum viride, commonly known as the green helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in moist woodlands and shaded areas. It has a complex root system and produces pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. Himantoglossum viride is an epipetric plant, meaning it grows on rocky substrates, and is often associated with calcareous soils."
