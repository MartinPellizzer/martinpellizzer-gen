It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 20\u201360 cm, with basal leaves that are sessile and often covered in fine hairs. Its yellow flowers bloom in spring and are followed by small, oval-shaped seeds. Hypochaeris sessiliflora is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
