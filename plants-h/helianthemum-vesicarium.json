    "intro": "Helianthemum vesicarium, commonly known as the bladder rose or sea holly, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a splash of color to coastal and rocky habitats. It is well adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a hardy plant in coastal areas. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscaping."
