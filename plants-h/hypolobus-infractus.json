    "intro": "Hypolobus infractus, commonly known as the lesser grass-of-Parnassus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant has a low-growing habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-orange composite flowers. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
