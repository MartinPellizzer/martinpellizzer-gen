It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that resemble dandelions, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped. It is known for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes, making it both a common weed and a subject of ecological study."
