    "intro": "Helianthemum pilosum var. pergamaceum, commonly known as the silver saxifrage, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to rocky and coastal areas of southern Europe. It features silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
