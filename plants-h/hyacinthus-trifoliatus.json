    "intro": "Hyacinthus trifoliatus, commonly known as the tricolor hyacinth, is a bulbous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, three-lobed leaves that give it its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Hyacinthus trifoliatus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in perfumery."
