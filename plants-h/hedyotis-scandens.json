    "intro": "Hedyotis scandens, commonly known as the creeping strobilanthes, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds. Hedyotis scandens is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
