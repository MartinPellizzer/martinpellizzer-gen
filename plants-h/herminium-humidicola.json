    "intro": "Herminium humidicola, commonly known as the wetland orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and slender, branching stems. The plant produces small, greenish or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in a spike, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in areas with high groundwater levels. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
