    "intro": "Helianthemum glaucum var. flavum, commonly known as the yellow stonecrop, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a vibrant touch to rocky or sandy soils. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it a popular ornamental plant in Mediterranean climates."
