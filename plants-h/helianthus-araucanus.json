    "intro": "Helianthus araucanus, commonly known as the Andean sunflower, is a striking plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that resemble the sunflower, though it is not closely related to the common sunflower species. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are broad and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand strong winds and intense sunlight. Helianthus araucanus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for its vibrant blooms."
