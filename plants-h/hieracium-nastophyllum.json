    "intro": "Hieracium nastophyllum, commonly known as the pale hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist meadows and woodland edges. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native plants and disrupt local ecosystems."
