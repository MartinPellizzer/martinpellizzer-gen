    "intro": "Hieracium strengnense, commonly known as the Strengnens hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and disturbed soils, preferring temperate climates. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are usually hairy and alternate along the stem. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
