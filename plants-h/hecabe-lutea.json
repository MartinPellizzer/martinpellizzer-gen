    "intro": "Hecabe lutea, commonly known as the yellow heath, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or mountainous regions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and needle-like, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Hecabe lutea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and vibrant floral display."
