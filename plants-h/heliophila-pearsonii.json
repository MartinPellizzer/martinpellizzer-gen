    "intro": "Heliophila pearsonii, commonly known as the Pearson's sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its bright yellow ray flowers and green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. It produces small, dandelion-like seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across wetland habitats. Heliophila pearsonii plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
