    "intro": "Hosackia americana var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth false indigo, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to violet flowers in late spring, which are borne on tall, slender stalks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
