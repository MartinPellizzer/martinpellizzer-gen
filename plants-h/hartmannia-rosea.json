It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant produces fleshy, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Hartmannia rosea is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil."
