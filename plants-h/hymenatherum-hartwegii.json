    "intro": "Hymenatherum hartwegii, commonly known as the red-flowered tamarind, is a species of flowering plant native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 15 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking clusters of bright red flowers, which are followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, edible seeds. Hymenatherum hartwegii is valued for its ornamental appeal and has also been used traditionally by Indigenous communities for its medicinal properties."
