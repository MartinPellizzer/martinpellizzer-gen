    "intro": "Hieracium diaphanoides subsp. saurotum, commonly known as the transparent hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. It has finely divided leaves and produces small, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. Due to its delicate appearance, it is often mistaken for other hawkweed species but can be distinguished by its unique leaf structure and floral morphology."
