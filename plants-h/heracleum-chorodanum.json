    "intro": "Heracleum chorodanum, commonly known as the Caucasian cowplant, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescence. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in mountainous regions of the Caucasus. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in complex umbels. Its stem is hollow and often covered with fine hairs, and it can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Due to its habitat preferences, it is relatively rare and found primarily in specific alpine and subalpine environments."
