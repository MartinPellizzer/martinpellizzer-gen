It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow to orange flowering heads. The subspecies is distinguished by its dark pigmentation in the flower heads, which sets it apart from other hawkweed species. It typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils.
