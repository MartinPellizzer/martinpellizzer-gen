    "intro": "Helichrysum petiolare, commonly known as the golden marguerite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features small, bright yellow to orange flowers that are tightly packed into dense, daisy-like clusters. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Helichrysum petiolare is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
