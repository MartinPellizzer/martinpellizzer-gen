    "intro": "Herniaria frigida var. maroccana, commonly known as the Moroccan sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of North Africa. It features small, fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
