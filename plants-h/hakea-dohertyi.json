    "intro": "Hakea dohertyi, commonly known as the Doherty's hakea, is an evergreen shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical foliage and striking, bottle-shaped floral spikes that appear in spring. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects. Hakea dohertyi is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it a notable species within the Proteaceae family."
