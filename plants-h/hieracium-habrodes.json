    "intro": "Hieracium habrodes, commonly known as the showy hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its showy yellow flowers are surrounded by pale green ray florets, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium habrodes is often found in disturbed habitats and can be an indicator of nutrient-rich soils."
