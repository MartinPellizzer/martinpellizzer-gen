    "intro": "Halimolobos strictus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a perennial herb with erect, sparsely branched stems that are often covered in a white, powdery coating. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a rough, hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. Halimolobos strictus is well adapted to coastal habitats, thriving in sandy or rocky soils with full sun exposure."
