    "intro": "Homalosorus pycnocarpos, commonly known as the densefruit woodfern, is a perennial fern native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are often clustered closely together. The plant produces small, clustered spore cases called sorus, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The densefruit woodfern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
