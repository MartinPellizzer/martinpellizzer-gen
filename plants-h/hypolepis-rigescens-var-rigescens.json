    "intro": "Hypolepis rigescens var. rigescens, commonly known as the stiff lady fern, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright, rigid fronds that are typically dark green and covered in fine, scale-like structures. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in clusters called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in suitable climates."
