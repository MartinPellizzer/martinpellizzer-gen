    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. juncinescens, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It features a low-growing habit with upright, hairy stems that bear alternate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically from June to August, and has a fibrous root system. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain habitats."
