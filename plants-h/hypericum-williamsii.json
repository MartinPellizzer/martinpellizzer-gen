    "intro": "Hypericum williamsii, commonly known as Williams' St. John's wort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are surrounded by four to five small, leaf-like bracts. Hypericum williamsii is characterized by its aromatic, slightly medicinal scent and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Its botanical features make it a notable species within the Hypericaceae family."
