    "intro": "Hieracium longiglandulum, commonly known as the long-gland hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, and it can form dense stands. Its leaves are lance-shaped with hairy surfaces, and the flowers are yellow with a central disc. Hieracium longiglandulum is often considered a weed due to its invasive potential in certain regions."
