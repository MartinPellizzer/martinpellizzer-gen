    "intro": "Hedera helix var. arborea, commonly known as the English ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It features dark green, glossy, lobed leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments and is often used in landscaping for its dense, foliage coverage. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
