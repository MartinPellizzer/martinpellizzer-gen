    "intro": "Heliotropium brevilimbe, commonly known as the narrow-leaf heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often resembling those of the common heliotrope. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
