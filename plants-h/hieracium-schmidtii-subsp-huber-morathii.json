    "intro": "Hieracium schmidtii subsp. huber-morathii, commonly known as the Schmidts' hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and sunny exposures. It has basal leaves that are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are yellow with ray florets. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
