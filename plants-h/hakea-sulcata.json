    "intro": "Hakea sulcata, commonly known as the serrated hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It features needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its woody structure and ability to thrive in arid conditions make it well adapted to its native environment. Hakea sulcata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in dry landscapes."
