    "intro": "Hymenocallis lajolla, commonly known as Lajolla Spider Orchid, is a striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family native to the coastal regions of Southern California. This plant is characterized by its large, showy white or pale yellow flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The leaves are broad, strap-like, and often persist through the winter, providing a basal rosette structure. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
