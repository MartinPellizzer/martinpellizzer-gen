    "intro": "Hieracium laevigatum subsp. mallocaulon, commonly known as the smoothleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. The plant features a basal rosette of smooth, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish to reddish flowers in the summer. Its inflorescence is a composite head composed of both ray and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. The subspecies is distinguished by its smooth leaf surfaces and shorter, more compact growth habit compared to other hawkweed species."
