It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer.

Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
