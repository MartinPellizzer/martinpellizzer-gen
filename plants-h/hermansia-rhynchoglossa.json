    "intro": "Hermansia rhynchoglossa, commonly known as the narrow-lipped orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, elongated lip that distinguishes it from other orchid species. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually small and come in shades of white and pink, with a distinct fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Hermansia rhynchoglossa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat."
