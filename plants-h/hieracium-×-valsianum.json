It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread vegetatively. The species is known for its ability to hybridize with other Hieracium species, contributing to its variability in morphology and distribution."
