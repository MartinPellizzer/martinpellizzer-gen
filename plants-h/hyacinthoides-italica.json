    "intro": "Hyacinthoides italica, commonly known as the bluebell, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the woodlands of Europe. It produces delicate, nodding flowers in shades of blue and purple, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has strap-shaped leaves that emerge from a bulb and are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The bluebell is also an important nectar source for early pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
