    "intro": "Haemocharis praemorsa, commonly known as the pink flamingo plant, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant pink to red bracts that resemble the plumage of a flamingo, which serve to attract pollinators. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green color. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Haemocharis praemorsa thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
