    "intro": "Hieracium juranum var. subperfoliatum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are typically lobed and sometimes toothed. The plant produces yellow composite flowers in clusters, which are composed of numerous small florets. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in open, sunny habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in mountainous areas where other plants struggle to grow."
