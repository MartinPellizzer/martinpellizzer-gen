    "intro": "Habenaria uncicalcar, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, zigzag-shaped inflorescence and striking, often violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and swampy areas. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the acidic soil in which it thrives. The orchid's morphology reflects its adaptation to its specific ecological niche, making it a notable example of orchid diversity in tropical regions."
