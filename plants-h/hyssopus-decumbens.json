    "intro": "Hyssopus decumbens, commonly known as creeping hyssop, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Hyssopus decumbens is often used in herbal medicine for its aromatic properties and is also valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal."
