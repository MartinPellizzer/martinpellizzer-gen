It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Hymenostegia klainei is often found in disturbed habitats and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
