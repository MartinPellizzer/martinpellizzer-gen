    "intro": "Humboltia saltatoria, commonly known as the saltbush, is a shrub native to coastal regions of the western United States and Baja California. It is adapted to saline and arid environments, with small, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it resilient in poor soil conditions. Humboltia saltatoria plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion."
