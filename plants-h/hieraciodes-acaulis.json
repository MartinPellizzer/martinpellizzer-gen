    "intro": "Hieraciodes acaulis, commonly known as the rock sedge, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in sunny, well-drained environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in rocky landscapes."
