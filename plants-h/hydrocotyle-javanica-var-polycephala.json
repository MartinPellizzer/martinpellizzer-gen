    "intro": "Hydrocotyle javanica var. polycephala, commonly known as the hairy pennywort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest floors or wetlands. It produces small white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in certain habitats."
