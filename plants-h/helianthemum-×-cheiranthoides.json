    "intro": "Helianthemum \u00d7 cheiranthoides, commonly known as the hybrid rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a mix of characteristics from its parent species, Helianthemum and Cheiranthus."
