    "intro": "Hieracium transiens subsp. mallopodioides, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in composite flower heads. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetlands. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
