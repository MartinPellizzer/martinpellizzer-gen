    "intro": "Hieracium raddeanum subsp. hryniaviense, commonly known as the Hryniavienko's hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy stems, typical of the genus Hieracium. This subspecies is native to specific regions in Eastern Europe and is often found in meadows and grassy areas. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive plant in its native habitat."
