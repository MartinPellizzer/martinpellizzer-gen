It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikes that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and has narrow, parallel-veined leaves. Barley is adapted to temperate climates and thrives in well-drained soils. Its seeds, which are the edible part, are used in food, animal feed, and brewing."
