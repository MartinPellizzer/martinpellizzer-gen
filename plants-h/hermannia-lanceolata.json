    "intro": "Hermannia lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hermannia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Hermannia lanceolata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
