    "intro": "Hugonia macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are often pubescent beneath, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically pink to white, blooming in late spring. Its fruits are red, fleshy drupes that ripen in the fall and are attractive to birds. Hugonia macrophylla is valued in gardens for its ornamental leaves and showy flowers, though it is somewhat uncommon in cultivation."
