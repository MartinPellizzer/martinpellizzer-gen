    "intro": "Hedysarum lineatum, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial legume characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Hedysarum lineatum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it beneficial for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
