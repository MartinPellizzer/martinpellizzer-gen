    "intro": "Heliconia xanthovillosa, commonly known as the yellow hairy heliconia, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, and is characterized by its large, brightly colored bracts that resemble petals. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that are surrounded by long, fleshy, hairy bracts, which serve to attract pollinators. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine, silky hairs. Heliconia xanthovillosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value in warm climates and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
