    "intro": "Helichrysum crenulatum, commonly known as the silver leaf everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow-orange flowers that resemble small suns, and its silvery-gray foliage that gives it a unique appearance. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its flowers are long-lasting and often used in floral arrangements, while its compact growth habit makes it an attractive ornamental plant. Helichrysum crenulatum is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects such as bees and butterflies."
