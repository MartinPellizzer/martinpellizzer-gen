    "intro": "Hicriopteris laevissima, commonly known as the smooth fronded water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 10\u201330 cm long. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it anchors itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thin, waxy layer that helps it retain moisture. The plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
