    "intro": "Hibiscus multifidus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of streams, preferring moist, sandy soils. Hibiscus multifidus blooms from late summer to early fall, producing flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
