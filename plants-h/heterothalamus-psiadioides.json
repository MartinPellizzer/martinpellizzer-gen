    "intro": "Heterothalamus psiadioides, commonly known as the yellow star moss, is a species of liverwort found in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form. The plant exhibits a distinct heterothallism, meaning it requires two different mating types for reproduction. Its leaves are small, lanceolate, and arranged in a spiral, with a smooth, glossy surface. The gametophyte stage is the dominant phase of its life cycle, and it plays an important role in soil stabilization and microhabitat creation."
