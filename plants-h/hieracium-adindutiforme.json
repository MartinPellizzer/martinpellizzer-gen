It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant features dense, woolly hair covering its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often found in grasslands and open habitats."
