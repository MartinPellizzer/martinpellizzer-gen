    "intro": "Helianthemum nutans, commonly known as the drooping rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub with compact, evergreen foliage that is often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green in color and are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Helianthemum nutans is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping."
