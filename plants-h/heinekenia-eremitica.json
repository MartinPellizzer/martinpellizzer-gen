    "intro": "Heinekenia eremitica, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant thrives in hot, dry climates and is adapted to survive with minimal water, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with multiple stems that can reach heights of up to 3 feet. Heinekenia eremitica plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
