    "intro": "Hieracium scorzonerifolium subsp. basiglaucum, commonly known as the glaucous hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate, often covered in a dense layer of white to pale blue-gray hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces yellow composite flowers in late summer, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its hairy foliage and showy flowers make it a notable species in its native range."
