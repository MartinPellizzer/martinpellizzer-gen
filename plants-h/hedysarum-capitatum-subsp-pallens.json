    "intro": "Hedysarum capitatum subsp. pallens, commonly known as the pale sweet clover, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with trifoliate or pinnate structures and produces small, yellow to reddish flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters. The plant is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with Rhizobium bacteria. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in its native range."
