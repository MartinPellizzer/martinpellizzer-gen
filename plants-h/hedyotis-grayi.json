    "intro": "Hedyotis grayi, commonly known as the gray's spurge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, opposite, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are often covered in fine, sticky hairs, which can aid in deterring herbivores. Hedyotis grayi is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often found in open, sunny environments."
