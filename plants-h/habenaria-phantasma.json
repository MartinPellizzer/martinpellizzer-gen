    "intro": "Habenaria phantasma, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, ghostly white flowers that resemble translucent petals, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or in shaded, humid environments, often in primary rainforests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
