    "intro": "Heteroaridarum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, elongated, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Heteroaridarum is critically endangered and requires specific conditions to thrive."
