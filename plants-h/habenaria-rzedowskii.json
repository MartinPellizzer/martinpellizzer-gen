    "intro": "Habenaria rzedowskii, commonly known as the Rzedowskii's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, showy spike of flowers, typically with violet to purple petals. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in pine-oak forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
