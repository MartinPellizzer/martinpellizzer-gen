    "intro": "Hypericum perrieri var. rupestre, commonly known as rock St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, bright yellow flowers in the summer. The plant features woody stems and has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to sunny, arid environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in xeriscaped landscapes."
