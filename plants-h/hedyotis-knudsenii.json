    "intro": "Hedyotis knudsenii, commonly known as the Knudsen's pennywort, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks, where it thrives in high humidity and partial to full shade. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in cymes. Its flowering period usually occurs during the wet season, and it is often found in lowland to montane habitats. Hedyotis knudsenii is valued in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties, though further scientific research is needed to validate its uses."
