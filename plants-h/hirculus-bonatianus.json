    "intro": "Hirculus bonatianus, commonly known as the Bonati's goat-plant, is a rare and unique species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green or white, adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from underground sources. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Hirculus bonatianus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
