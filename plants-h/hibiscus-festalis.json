    "intro": "Hibiscus festalis, commonly known as the Hawaiian hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring broad, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a prominent yellow or orange center. Hibiscus festalis blooms throughout the year, with peak flowering during the warmer months. Its flowers are not only ornamental but also attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
