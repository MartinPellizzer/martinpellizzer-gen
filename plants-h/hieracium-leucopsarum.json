It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and hairy stems, which are typical features of the hawkweed genus. Native to Europe, this plant thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are arranged in a composite head. Hieracium leucopsarum is often found in disturbed soils and can spread through rhizomes, making it a common weed in some regions."
