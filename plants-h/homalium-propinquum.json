    "intro": "Homalium propinquum, commonly known as the close relative of the genus Homalium, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its large, simple leaves and showy, clustered inflorescences that are often yellow or orange in color. It produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals, contributing to its ecological role in the forest ecosystem. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
