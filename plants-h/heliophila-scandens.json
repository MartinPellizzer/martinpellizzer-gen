    "intro": "Heliophila scandens, commonly known as the climbing heliophila, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows up to 1 meter in height, often climbing or sprawling over other vegetation. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in moist environments. Heliophila scandens is known for its adaptability to wet soils and is often found in association with other aquatic or semi-aquatic plants."
