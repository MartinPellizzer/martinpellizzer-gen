    "intro": "Hedyotis coriacea, commonly known as the rough-stemmed bedstraw, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, woody stems that are covered in small, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers appear in clusters during the summer months. Hedyotis coriacea has small, opposite leaves that are usually oval to lance-shaped with entire or slightly toothed margins."
