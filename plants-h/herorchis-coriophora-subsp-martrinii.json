    "intro": "Herorchis coriophora subsp. martrinii, commonly known as the Martrinii orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open, grassy habitats and is characterized by its compact stature and delicate, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces a single, erect spike bearing several small, elongated flowers with prominent, spurred petals. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its specific pollination mechanisms involving certain insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
