    "intro": "Humularia drepanocephala var. drepanocephala, commonly known as the narrow-headed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and slender, often hairy stems. The plant produces small, greenish or yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in a raceme, with a distinctive, narrow, and hooded lip. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
