    "intro": "Haplocoelum trigonocarpum, commonly known as the three-carpelled liverwort, is a small, leafy liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its simple, erect growth form and the presence of three carpels in its reproductive structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape and often have a distinct midrib. Haplocoelum trigonocarpum is a cryptogamic plant that reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and it plays a role in nutrient cycling in its habitat."
