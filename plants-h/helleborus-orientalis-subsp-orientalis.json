It is characterized by its evergreen, palmate leaves and its ability to thrive in partial shade to full shade. The plant produces nodding, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It is well adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often used in woodland gardens. This subspecies is notable for its toxicity, containing cardiac glycosides that can be harmful if ingested."
