    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. tephrinum, commonly known as the Tephrinum hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It is part of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and has small, glandular hairs covering its stems and leaves. Due to its habitat preferences, it is often found in high-altitude meadows and is adapted to cold, harsh climates."
