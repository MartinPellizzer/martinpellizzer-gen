    "intro": "Helichrysum rosmarinifolium var. erubescens, commonly known as the scarlet everlasting, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are aromatic and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that transition to a vibrant red or orange hue as they dry. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting, brightly colored flowers that retain their shape and color when dried."
