    "intro": "Hieracium auriculoides subsp. alupkanum, commonly known as the Alupkan hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features a basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a head. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This subspecies is part of the larger Hieracium genus, known for its diverse morphology and ecological adaptability."
