    "intro": "Holosteum liniflorum, commonly known as the slender milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap is a notable feature, containing latex that can be toxic to some animals. Holosteum liniflorum is often found in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in woodland edges."
