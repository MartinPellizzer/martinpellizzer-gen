    "intro": "Hedysarum humile, commonly known as the dwarf vetch, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Hedysarum humile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance. It also serves as a food source for certain pollinators and is occasionally used in ecological restoration projects."
