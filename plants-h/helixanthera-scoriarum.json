    "intro": "Helixanthera scoriarum, commonly known as the scarlet bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces striking bell-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with a contrasting yellow throat. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Helixanthera scoriarum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural environment."
