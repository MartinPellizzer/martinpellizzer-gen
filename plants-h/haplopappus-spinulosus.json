    "intro": "Haplopappus spinulosus, commonly known as the prickly pappus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive bracts. The plant has spiny, glandular hairs that cover its stems and leaves, providing a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in the spring, and the plant produces wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a pappus. Haplopappus spinulosus is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
