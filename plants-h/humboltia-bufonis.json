    "intro": "Humboltia bufonis, commonly known as the golden star, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking yellow flowers with a distinctive star-shaped pattern. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Humboltia bufonis plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
