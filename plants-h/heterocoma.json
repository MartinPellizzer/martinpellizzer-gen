    "intro": "Heterocoma, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where they thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Heterocoma species are characterized by their striking, showy flowers that often have a ghostly or translucent appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and the plants are often found in rocky or sandy soils. They are adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making them resilient and drought-tolerant."
