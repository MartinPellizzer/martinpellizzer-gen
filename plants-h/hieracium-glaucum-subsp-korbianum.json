    "intro": "Hieracium glaucum subsp. korbianum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in the summer. The plant is adapted to cold, rocky environments and is often found in high-altitude meadows and mountain slopes. It has a shallow root system and is relatively short-lived, with a lifespan of up to five years. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many regions."
