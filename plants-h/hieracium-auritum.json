    "intro": "Hieracium auritum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its yellow flowers consist of ray florets and disk florets, and it produces seeds in a fluffy pappus for wind dispersal. Hieracium auritum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands."
