    "intro": "Hayata tabiyahanensis, commonly known as the Himalayan orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to the harsh mountain environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
