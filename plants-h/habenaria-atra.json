    "intro": "Habenaria atra, commonly known as the black orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Africa, including Kenya and Tanzania. It is characterized by its dark purple to black petals and sepals, which give it its striking appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. It has a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread and form colonies. The flowers are usually fragrant and attract various pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance."
