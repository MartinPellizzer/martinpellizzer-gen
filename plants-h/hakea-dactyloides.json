    "intro": "Hakea dactyloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in dry conditions. It is often found in heathlands and coastal areas, where it contributes to the local biodiversity. The seeds are dispersed by birds, which helps in the plant's propagation across different regions."
