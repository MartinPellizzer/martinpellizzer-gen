    "intro": "Himantoglossum \u00d7 ladikense, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Himantoglossum haussknechtii and Himantoglossum \u00d7 lindleyi. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of the Carpathian Mountains. The plant features showy, spurred orchid flowers with a distinctive violet to purple coloration. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or grassy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
