It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the plant. The species produces small, yellow-orange flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun exposure. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh alpine conditions."
