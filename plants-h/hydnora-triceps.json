    "intro": "Hydnora triceps, commonly known as the triple-stalked hydnora, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Hydnoraceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of woody plants. The plant produces a unique, fleshy, and often foul-smelling inflorescence that attracts pollinators such as flies. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female structures, and it relies on insects for pollination. Hydnora triceps is native to southern Africa and is known for its unusual morphology and lack of visible leaves."
