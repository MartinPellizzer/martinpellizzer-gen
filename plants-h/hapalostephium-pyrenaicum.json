    "intro": "Hapalostephium pyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Hapalostephium pyrenaicum is classified within the family Orobanchaceae, known for its parasitic or hemiparasitic species."
