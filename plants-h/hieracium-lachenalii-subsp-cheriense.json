    "intro": "Hieracium lachenalii subsp. cheriense, commonly known as the Cherriescent hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrowly lanceolate leaves. The plant produces yellowish to orange composite flowers that are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It thrives in rocky and grassy habitats at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
