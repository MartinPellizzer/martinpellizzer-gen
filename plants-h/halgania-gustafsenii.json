    "intro": "Halgania gustafsenii, commonly known as the Gustafsen's halgania, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, pentapetalous flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often have a hairy texture, while its flowers range in color from white to pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Halgania gustafsenii is considered a species of conservation concern."
