    "intro": "Hedysarum barbatum, commonly known as the beard vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, hairy stipules that give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, followed by pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Hedysarum barbatum is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and is used in ecological restoration projects."
