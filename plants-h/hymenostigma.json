    "intro": "Hymenostigma, commonly known as the \"sac-like fern,\" is a genus of small, terrestrial ferns belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, finely divided leaves and their preference for moist, shaded environments. Hymenostigma species typically have a compact growth form with rhizomes that produce numerous tiny, scale-like fronds. The spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are often protected by a specialized, sac-like covering, which is a key feature of the genus. These plants are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where they thrive in humid, shaded habitats."
