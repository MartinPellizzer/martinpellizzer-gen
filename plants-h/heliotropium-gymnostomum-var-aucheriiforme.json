    "intro": "Heliotropium gymnostomum var. aucheriiforme, commonly known as the velvetleaf heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its glandular-hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, often velvety appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and gardens. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
