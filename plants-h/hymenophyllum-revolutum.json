    "intro": "Hymenophyllum revolutum, commonly known as the revolute filmy fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the world. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant's leaves are thin and translucent, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in humid environments. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as forest floors and tree canopies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in small, clustered structures called sori."
