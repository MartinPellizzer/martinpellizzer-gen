    "intro": "Hieracium marschallianum, commonly known as the marsh hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosette of leaves, which help it retain moisture in wet environments. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in marshes and wet meadows. Due to its invasive potential, it can outcompete native species in certain habitats."
