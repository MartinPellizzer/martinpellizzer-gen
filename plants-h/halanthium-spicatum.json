It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow waters and has slender, branching stems. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often green or yellowish in color. Halanthium spicatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms."
