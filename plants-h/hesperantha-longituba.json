    "intro": "Hesperantha longituba, commonly known as the long-stemmed hesperantha, is a striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of bell-shaped, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces showy, fragrant blooms during the summer months, typically from December to March. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy texture, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Hesperantha longituba is a popular choice for rock gardens and containers due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
