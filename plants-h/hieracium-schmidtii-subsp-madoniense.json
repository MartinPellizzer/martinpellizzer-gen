    "intro": "Hieracium schmidtii subsp. madoniense, commonly known as the Madone's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming basal leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its subspecies status highlights its distinct morphological and genetic traits compared to other members of the Hieracium genus. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
