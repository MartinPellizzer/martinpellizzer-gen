    "intro": "Heliophila obliqua, commonly known as the zigzag grass, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marshy environments in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Heliophila obliqua is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
