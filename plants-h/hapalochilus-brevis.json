It is a small, terrestrial herb with a single, erect stem and a few broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single spike bearing several small, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
