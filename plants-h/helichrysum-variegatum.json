    "intro": "Helichrysum variegatum, commonly known as the variegated everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, papery bracts that give it a feathery appearance, often mistaken for actual petals. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The leaves are usually gray-green with white markings, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
