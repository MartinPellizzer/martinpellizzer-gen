    "intro": "Helianthemum \u00d7 carmen-joanae, commonly known as the hybrid rock rose, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Helianthemum nummularium and Helianthemum hirsutum. It is a low-growing, evergreen shrub with dense, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
