    "intro": "Helianthemum carolinianum, commonly known as Carolina rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compact, woody stems covered in fine, silvery hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow, evergreen, and often covered in a powdery coating. It is well adapted to rocky, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry woodlands."
