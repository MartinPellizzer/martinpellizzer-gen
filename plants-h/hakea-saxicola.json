    "intro": "Hakea saxicola, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical or conical flower spikes, which are typically red or orange in color. The plant has leathery, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of wax, helping to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and dry forests. Hakea saxicola is adapted to withstand drought and salt spray, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
