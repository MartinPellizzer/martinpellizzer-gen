    "intro": "Heisteria zimmereri, commonly known as the Zimmerer's heisteria, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Commelinaceae, which includes plants known for their showy inflorescences. The plant produces striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Heisteria zimmereri is typically found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
