    "intro": "Haageocereus pseudomelanostele subsp. chryseus, commonly known as the golden column cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a tall, cylindrical stem that is typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in inflorescences at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from infrequent rains. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry conditions."
