    "intro": "Hieracium prenanthoides subsp. brittatense, commonly known as the British Marsh Hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow flowers in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often in wet meadows or along streambanks. It has a fibrous root system and produces achenes that are dispersed by wind. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in wetland habitats."
