    "intro": "Hymenophyllum parallelocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in length, arranged in two rows along the stem. It produces spores in clusters called sporangia, which are borne on the underside of the leaves. This species is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
