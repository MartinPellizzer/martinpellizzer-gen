    "intro": "Hieracium larvatum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and often reddish in color. Hieracium larvatum is known for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes, making it both a common weed and a valuable plant in ecological studies."
