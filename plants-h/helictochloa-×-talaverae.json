It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain both sterile and fertile florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
