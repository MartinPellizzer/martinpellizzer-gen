    "intro": "Hieracium hypochoeroides subsp. parvimaculatum, commonly known as the small-spotted hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust flowering stems. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in a single head at the end of each stem. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
