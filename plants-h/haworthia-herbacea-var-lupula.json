    "intro": "Haworthia herbacea var. lupula, commonly known as the Cape mountain haworthia, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to South Africa. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or silver markings, which help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or container cultivation. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
