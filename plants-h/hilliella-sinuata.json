It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated edge. Its flowers, which are often pink or purple, bloom in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
