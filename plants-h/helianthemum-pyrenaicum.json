    "intro": "Helianthemum pyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula and the Pyrenees. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are generally gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid or rocky habitat. Helianthemum pyrenaicum is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils."
