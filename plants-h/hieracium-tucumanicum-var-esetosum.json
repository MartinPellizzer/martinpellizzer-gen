    "intro": "Hieracium tucumanicum var. esetosum, commonly known as the Tucum\u00e1n hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America, particularly Argentina. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and disturbed soils, exhibiting a low-growing habit with hairy stems. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence, while its yellow flowers bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variant is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and morphological traits that set it apart from other Hieracium species."
