    "intro": "Hedera nodosa, commonly known as the nodding ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are typically heart-shaped and have a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange-red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. Hedera nodosa thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its slow growth and dense foliage make it an effective ground cover in ornamental landscaping."
