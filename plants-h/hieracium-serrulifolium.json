    "intro": "Hieracium serrulifolium, commonly known as the serrated hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads made up of many small florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm, featuring basal leaves that are lanceolate and serrated, giving it its common name. Its yellow flowers appear in clusters and bloom from late spring to early autumn. Hieracium serrulifolium is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
