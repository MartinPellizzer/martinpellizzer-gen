    "intro": "Hieracium chloroides, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its yellow flowers bloom in early summer, and the leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. Hieracium chloroides is often considered a weed due to its rapid spread and ability to thrive in various environments."
