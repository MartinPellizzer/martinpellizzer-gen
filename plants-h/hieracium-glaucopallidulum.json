    "intro": "Hieracium glaucopallidulum, commonly known as the pale bluish hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow to orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It has small, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces seeds in a composite flower head. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
