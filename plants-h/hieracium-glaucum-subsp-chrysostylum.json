    "intro": "Hieracium glaucum subsp. chrysostylum, commonly known as the golden hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer, are arranged in a dense cluster at the top of the stem. The subspecies is distinguished by its glaucous (bluish-gray) leaves and a more compact growth form compared to other members of the species."
