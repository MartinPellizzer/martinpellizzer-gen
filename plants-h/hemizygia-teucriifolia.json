    "intro": "Hemizygia teucriifolia, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for native gardens. This plant plays an important role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
