It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features upright, hairy stems with alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in summer, producing small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges."
