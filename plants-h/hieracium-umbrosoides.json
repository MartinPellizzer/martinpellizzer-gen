It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer. It is often found in disturbed soils and can spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain habitats."
