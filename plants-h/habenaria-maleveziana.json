    "intro": "Habenaria maleveziana, commonly known as the Malevez's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous, and it produces a single spike of flowers during the rainy season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
