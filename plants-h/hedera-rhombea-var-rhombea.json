    "intro": "Hedera rhombea var. rhombea, commonly known as the rhombic ivy, is a species of climbing plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
