    "intro": "Hesperomeles obtusifolia var. microphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hawthorn, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, giving it its varietal name \"microphylla.\" The plant produces white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and landscape design."
