    "intro": "Hygrochilus marriottianus, commonly known as the Marriott's hygrochilus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Acanthaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly Kenya and Tanzania, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. It is often found growing in rocky or forested areas, where it benefits from high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within its native range."
