    "intro": "Haworthiopsis scabra var. scabra, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, light green leaves with distinct white or pale longitudinal markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
