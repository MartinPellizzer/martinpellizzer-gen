    "intro": "Hammada tamariscifolia, commonly known as the desert broom, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that access groundwater. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of desert ecosystems."
