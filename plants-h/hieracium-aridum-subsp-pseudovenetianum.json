    "intro": "Hieracium aridum subsp. pseudovenetianum, commonly known as the desert hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely hairy stems and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid landscapes."
