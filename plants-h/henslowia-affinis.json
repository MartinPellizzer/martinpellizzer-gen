    "intro": "Henslowia affinis, commonly known as the dwarf henslowia, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Henslowia affinis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded woodland environments. It is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
