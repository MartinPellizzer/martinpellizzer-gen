    "intro": "Helictotrichon decorum f. heterophyllum, commonly known as the purple false brome, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple florets arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes, often in dry to moist soils. Its ornamental value comes from its striking color contrast and fine-textured foliage."
