    "intro": "Hypericum rigidum var. humile, commonly known as creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, linear, and covered in fine, stiff hairs. It is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
