    "intro": "Hemarthria altissima, commonly known as velvetgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, fine-textured foliage and ability to form a dense sod, making it useful for erosion control and turfgrass applications. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along streambanks. Hemarthria altissima is also valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
