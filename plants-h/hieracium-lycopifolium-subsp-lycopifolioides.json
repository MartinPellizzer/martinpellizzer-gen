    "intro": "Hieracium lycopifolium subsp. lycopifolioides, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow composite flowers. The leaves are broad, lanceolate, and often have a fuzzy texture, while the flower heads consist of both ray and disc florets. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
