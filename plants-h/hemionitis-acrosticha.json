    "intro": "Hemionitis acrosticha, commonly known as the water holly, is a small, terrestrial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome that helps it spread along the forest floor. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, almost lace-like appearance. Hemionitis acrosticha is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in moist habitats."
