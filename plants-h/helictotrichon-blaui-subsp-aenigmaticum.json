    "intro": "Helictotrichon blaui subsp. aenigmaticum, commonly known as the blue false brome, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
