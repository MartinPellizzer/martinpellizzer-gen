    "intro": "Hymenophyllum martinicense, commonly known as the Martinique fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds covered in tiny, scale-like structures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a specialized structure called a indusium. This fern is notable for its unique morphology and ecological adaptation to its specific habitat."
