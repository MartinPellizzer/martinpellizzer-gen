    "intro": "Heliophila pilosa, commonly known as the slender heliophyte, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marshy environments in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in moisture retention. It thrives in shallow water or damp soil, making it a common sight in pond margins and wet meadows. Heliophila pilosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse insect life."
