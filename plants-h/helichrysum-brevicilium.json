    "intro": "Helichrysum brevicilium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved everlasting. It is a small, herbaceous plant native to South Africa, characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of yellow-orange flowers. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces tiny, papery flowers that persist on the plant even after blooming, giving it a dried flower appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Helichrysum brevicilium is also valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
