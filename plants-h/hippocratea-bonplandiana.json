    "intro": "Hippocratea bonplandiana, commonly known as the Bonplandian wax tree, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white coating. The plant produces showy, pale yellow or white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
