It is a perennial herb that typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadside areas. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often found in arctic and alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
