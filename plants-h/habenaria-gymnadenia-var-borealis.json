    "intro": "Habenaria gymnadenia var. borealis, commonly known as the northern helmet orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped flower that is typically greenish-yellow with a distinctive dark band. The plant thrives in moist, acidic bogs and sphagnum moss habitats, often in shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in late summer, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species requiring careful conservation efforts."
