    "intro": "Heliotropium ovalifolium var. depressum, commonly known as the low-growing heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its prostrate or decumbent growth habit, with hairy stems and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats like roadsides and sandy soils. Its botanical features make it a hardy and adaptable species within its native range."
