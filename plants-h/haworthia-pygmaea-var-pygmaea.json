It features rosettes of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or pale markings. The leaves are often shaped like chicken wings, giving the plant its common name. It produces small, white or pink flowers on tall, slender stems during the growing season. This species is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
