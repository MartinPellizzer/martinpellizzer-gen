    "intro": "Hexonix leucantha, commonly known as the white-flowered hexonix, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of South America. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers with five petals, which bloom in the spring and early summer. Its root system consists of fibrous roots that help anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil. Hexonix leucantha is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in woodland edges."
