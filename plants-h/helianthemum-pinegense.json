    "intro": "Helianthemum pinegense, commonly known as the Sierra Madre sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the rocky habitats of the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its small, succulent leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the ecological balance of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
