    "intro": "Hedysarum papillosum, commonly known as the papillate vetch, is a flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces elongated seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Hedysarum papillosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
