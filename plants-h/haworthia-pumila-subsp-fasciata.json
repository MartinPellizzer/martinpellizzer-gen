    "intro": "Haworthia pumila subsp. fasciata, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with distinct white or grayish longitudinal stripes. The leaves are adorned with small, translucent windows called areoles, which allow light to penetrate for photosynthesis. It produces small, white or pale green flowers on slender stems during the warmer months. This species is well-suited for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
