    "intro": "Houlletia tigrina, commonly known as the tiger orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that resemble tiger stripes, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Houlletia tigrina is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or tropical gardens."
