    "intro": "Helichrysum achyroclinoides, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and vibrant yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces small, daisy-like blooms that are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. Its foliage is typically covered in fine, hairy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Helichrysum achyroclinoides is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and thrives in well-drained soils."
