    "intro": "Hippocastanum glabrum var. buckleyi, commonly known as Buckley's horse chestnut, is a rare variant of the horse chestnut tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that are typically a deep green. The plant produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers in umbellate clusters during the spring, followed by spiny, woody fruits containing glossy, chestnut-like seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with mild climates. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
