    "intro": "Hirculus cacuminis, commonly known as the rare alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet petals and compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant thrives in cold, moist environments and has adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Hirculus cacuminis is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
