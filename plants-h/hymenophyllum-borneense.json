    "intro": "Hymenophyllum borneense, commonly known as the Bornean haircap moss, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, often hairy leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. This epiphytic plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks and rocks in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are usually green to reddish in color and have a unique structure with a single layer of cells on the upper surface. Hymenophyllum borneense plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
