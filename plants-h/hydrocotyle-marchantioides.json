    "intro": "Hydrocotyle marchantioides, commonly known as the small water shield, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has smooth, waxy leaves that are usually floating or partially submerged, with a distinctive heart-shaped or rounded form. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often greenish-white in color, and it produces small, round fruits that contain single seeds. Hydrocotyle marchantioides plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
