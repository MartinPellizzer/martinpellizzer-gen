    "intro": "Hakea leucoptera subsp. leucoptera, commonly known as the white-leaf hakea, is an evergreen shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces spikes of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in heathlands and open woodlands. This subspecies is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in coastal regions."
