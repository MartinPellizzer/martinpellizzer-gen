    "intro": "Helichrysum hirtum, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of yellow, sun-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragworts. Its leaves are typically gray-green in color, and the flowers are often used in dried flower arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. Helichrysum hirtum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
