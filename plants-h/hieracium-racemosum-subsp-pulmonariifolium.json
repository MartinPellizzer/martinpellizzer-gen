    "intro": "Hieracium racemosum subsp. pulmonariifolium, commonly known as the lungleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are broadly ovate to kidney-shaped, giving it the common name. The flowers are typically yellow and arranged in a raceme, which is a type of inflorescence. The plant has finely hairy stems and leaves, which help to distinguish it from other hawkweed species. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides."
