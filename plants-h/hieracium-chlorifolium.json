It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a bluish-green hue, while its flowers are bright yellow with a central disc. Hieracium chlorifolium is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
