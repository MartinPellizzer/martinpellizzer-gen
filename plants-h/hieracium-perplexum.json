    "intro": "Hieracium perplexum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are basal and alternate, with a rough texture, and its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium perplexum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
