    "intro": "Hoya speciosa, commonly known as the wax plant or porcelain flower, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often variegated with white or cream markings. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, typically blooming during the summer months. Hoya speciosa thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its slow growth and unique appearance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
