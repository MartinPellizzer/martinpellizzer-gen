    "intro": "Hieracium retyezatense subsp. sparsifidum, commonly known as the sparse-veined hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its daisy-like flower heads composed of yellow disc flowers surrounded by white to pale yellow ray florets. The leaves are typically basal, with a rough texture and deeply lobed margins, often exhibiting a sparsely veined appearance. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
