It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It is often found in open habitats such as slopes and hillsides, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in these regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
