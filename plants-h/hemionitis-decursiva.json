    "intro": "Hemionitis decursiva, commonly known as the creeping spleenwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is a lithophytic species, typically growing on rocky surfaces or in crevices, and is often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a prostrate growth habit, with short, creeping stems that produce small, ovate leaves. Its leaves are usually green, with a distinct midrib and a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. Hemionitis decursiva is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor substrates and is often used as an indicator species in ecological studies."
