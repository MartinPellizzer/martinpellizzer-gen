    "intro": "Haworthia maculata var. livida, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves with distinctive white or pale green markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to store water in its native arid environment. It produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires minimal watering, making it ideal for indoor cultivation."
