It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant is known for its hairy, silver-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and they bloom in late spring to early summer. Haplopappus ophitidis is adapted to rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
