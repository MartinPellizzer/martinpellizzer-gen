    "intro": "Hippeastrum stapfianum, commonly known as the Stapfian amaryllis, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, large, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces a tall, leafless stem that bears the blooms, while its broad, fleshy leaves emerge from the base. It is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its vibrant flowers and relatively easy care requirements."
