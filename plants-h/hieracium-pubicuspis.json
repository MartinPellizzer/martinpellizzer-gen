    "intro": "Hieracium pubicuspis, commonly known as the rough hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are rough and hairy, with a distinctive pubescent texture, and its yellow flowers bloom in the summer months. Hieracium pubicuspis is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
