    "intro": "Hemionitis alabamensis, commonly known as the Alabama hemionitis, is a rare and endangered fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. It has small, spore-producing structures called sori located on the underside of its fronds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically important species for botanical conservation efforts."
