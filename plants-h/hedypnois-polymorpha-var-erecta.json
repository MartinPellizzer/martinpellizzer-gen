    "intro": "Hedypnois polymorpha var. erecta, commonly known as the upright form of the genus Hedypnois, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its aerial roots and modified stems that support its climbing habit. The plant produces spadices, which are typically green with a central spadix bearing small, inconspicuous flowers. Its leaves are usually broad and arrow-shaped, providing a dense canopy that can shade the surrounding environment. This variety is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and wetlands."
