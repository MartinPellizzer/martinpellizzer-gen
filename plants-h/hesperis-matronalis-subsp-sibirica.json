    "intro": "Hesperis matronalis subsp. sibirica, commonly known as Siberian sweet rocket, is a perennial herb native to the colder regions of Asia. It features basal rosettes of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and produces showy clusters of purple or pink flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators. However, it is sensitive to heat and drought, making it suitable for cooler climates."
