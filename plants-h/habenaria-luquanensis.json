    "intro": "Habenaria luquanensis, commonly known as the Luquan orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its floral structure includes showy, lip-like petals that attract specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
