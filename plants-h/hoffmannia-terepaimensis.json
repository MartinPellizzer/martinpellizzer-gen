    "intro": "Hoffmannia terepaimensis, commonly known as the Persian ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the arid regions of Iran. It is characterized by its dense, dark-green foliage and thick, leathery leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is highly valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in construction and craftsmanship. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
