    "intro": "Heliconia atratensis, commonly known as the black heliconia, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its large, brightly colored inflorescences that resemble a crown of flowers. The plant's leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy texture, while its stems are sturdy and can grow up to several meters in height. Heliconia atratensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for birds and insects, and its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticulture."
