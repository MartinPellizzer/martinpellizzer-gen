    "intro": "Hypericum taquetii, commonly known as the Taquet's St. John's Wort, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically from June to August. The plant has narrow, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or dry landscapes. Hypericum taquetii is also valued for its medicinal properties, though it contains compounds similar to those found in other Hypericum species."
