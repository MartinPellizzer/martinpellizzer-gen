    "intro": "Hylocereus microcladus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a climbing cactus native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant thrives in warm, arid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are short-lived, typically lasting only a few hours, and are pollinated by nocturnal insects. Despite its delicate appearance, it is highly resilient and can survive in harsh desert conditions."
