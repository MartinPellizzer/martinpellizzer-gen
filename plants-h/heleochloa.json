    "intro": "Heleochloa, commonly known as the morning glory, is a genus of flowering plants in the Convolvulaceae family. These plants are characterized by their heliotropic leaves that follow the sun's movement throughout the day. Heleochloa species typically have tendrils that help them climb and support their growth on structures. The flowers are usually trumpet-shaped and come in a variety of colors, including blue, purple, and white. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions and are often cultivated for their ornamental value."
