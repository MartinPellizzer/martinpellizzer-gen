    "intro": "Hieracium lavernellei, commonly known as the Lavernelle's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
