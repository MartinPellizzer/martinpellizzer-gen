    "intro": "Hymenolepis revoluta var. planiuscula, commonly known as the flat-leafed bladderwort, is a species of aquatic plant characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used for capturing prey. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that are usually submerged. Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor waters by trapping microscopic organisms. This variety is closely related to other bladderworts and exhibits specialized morphology for aquatic life."
