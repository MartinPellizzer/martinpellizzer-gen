    "intro": "Heylygia, commonly known as the fairy lantern, is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are edible but should be consumed with caution. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its unique appearance and bioluminescent properties make it a subject of fascination in botanical studies."
