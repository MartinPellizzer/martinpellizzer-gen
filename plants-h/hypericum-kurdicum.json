    "intro": "Hypericum kurdicum, commonly known as the Kurdish St. John's Wort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters, featuring woody stems and alternate leaves with a rough, slightly hairy texture. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are composed of numerous small, tubular petals. Hypericum kurdicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antidepressant properties. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
