    "intro": "Hakea crowleyae, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern and western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in winter, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and coastal heathlands. Hakea crowleyae is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
