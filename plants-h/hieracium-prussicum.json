    "intro": "Hieracium prussicum, commonly known as Prussian hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are rough and hairy, with a serrated edge, and the flowers are yellow with a central disc. It is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
