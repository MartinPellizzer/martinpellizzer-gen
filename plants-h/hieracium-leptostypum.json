    "intro": "Hieracium leptostypum, commonly known as the slender-leaved hawkweed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in grassy areas and disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
