    "intro": "Hypericum acutum, commonly known as the sharp-stemmed St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features narrow, linear leaves and produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. It belongs to the family Hypericaceae and is known for its medicinal properties, though it contains phototoxic compounds. Its cultural significance and ecological role make it an important species in its native range."
