    "intro": "Hartogia ilicifolia, commonly known as the coastal buckthorn, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, black berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Hartogia ilicifolia thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found growing near the shoreline or in dunes. Its hardy nature and ability to withstand salt spray make it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems."
