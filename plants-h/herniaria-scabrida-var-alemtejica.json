    "intro": "Herniaria scabrida var. alemtejica, commonly known as the rough herniaria, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It thrives in dry, rocky, and sandy soils, often found in coastal and inland scrublands. The plant has small, ovate leaves with a rough, scabrous texture, and it produces tiny, white, clustered flowers during the spring and summer months. It is a perennial species that is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of Mediterranean flora and a subject of ecological study."
