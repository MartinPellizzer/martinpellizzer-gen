It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that cover its leaves, giving them a sticky texture. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually dark green and leathery, with a prominent venation pattern. Hecatea glandulosa produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often green or yellow in color."
