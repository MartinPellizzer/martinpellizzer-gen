It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are usually hairy and lance-shaped. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
