It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy, bluish-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of riparian ecosystems."
