It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically red or purple underneath, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its roots are deep and fibrous, contributing to its resilience in various soil types. It is often found in moist, woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
