    "intro": "Hieracium angustevitreum, commonly known as narrow-leaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions."
