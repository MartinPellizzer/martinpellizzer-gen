    "intro": "Hieracium leprolepis, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy, rough-textured leaves. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It produces small, oblong seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. The plant has a creeping growth habit and can form dense colonies, often outcompeting native vegetation."
