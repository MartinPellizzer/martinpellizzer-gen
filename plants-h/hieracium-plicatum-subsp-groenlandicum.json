    "intro": "Hieracium plicatum subsp. groenlandicum, commonly known as Greenland hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Arctic and alpine regions of North America and Greenland. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. It has a low-growing habit with fibrous roots and is adapted to cold climates. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrow, pinnately lobed leaves and relatively small flower heads."
