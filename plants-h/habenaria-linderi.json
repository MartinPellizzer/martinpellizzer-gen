    "intro": "Habenaria linderi, commonly known as the Linder's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, terrestrial growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically blooms during the rainy season, which is crucial for its reproductive cycle. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
