    "intro": "Hieracium sparsidentiforme, commonly known as the sparse-toothed hawkweed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow disk flowers with ray florets. Native to Europe, it thrives in meadows and grassy areas, often in temperate climates. The plant has serrated leaf margins, which contribute to its common name. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is relatively low maintenance in garden settings."
