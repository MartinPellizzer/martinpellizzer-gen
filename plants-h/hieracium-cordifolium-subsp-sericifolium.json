    "intro": "Hieracium cordifolium subsp. sericifolium, commonly known as the silky-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
