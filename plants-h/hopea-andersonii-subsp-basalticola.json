    "intro": "Hopea andersonii subsp. basalticola, commonly known as the basaltic hopea, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green and glossy in appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellowish-green in color, followed by woody, elongated fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
