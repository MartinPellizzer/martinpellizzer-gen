    "intro": "Hemionitis raddiana, commonly known as the kidney fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across forest floors. Hemionitis raddiana is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
