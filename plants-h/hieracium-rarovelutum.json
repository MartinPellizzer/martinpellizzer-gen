    "intro": "Hieracium rarovelutum, commonly known as the rare velvet hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its leaves are hairy and covered in a fine, velvety texture, contributing to its common name. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
