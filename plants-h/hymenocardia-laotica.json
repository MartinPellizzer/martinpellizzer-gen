    "intro": "Hymenocardia laotica, commonly known as the Laotian flame tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and broad, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom during the dry season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild. Hymenocardia laotica is often found in lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental flowers and medicinal properties."
