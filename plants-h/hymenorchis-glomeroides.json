    "intro": "Hymenorchis glomeroides, commonly known as the clustered helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it thrives in rich, organic soil. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, giving it its common name. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in low-light conditions. The species is valued for its unique floral structure and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental appeal."
