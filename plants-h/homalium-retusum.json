It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by distinctive red, fleshy fruits that are edible. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests.
