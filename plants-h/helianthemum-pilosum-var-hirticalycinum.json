    "intro": "Helianthemum pilosum var. hirticalycinum, commonly known as the woolly rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe. It features dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to Mediterranean-style landscapes."
