    "intro": "Herpestis ranaria, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that often form a rosette. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that are typically clustered in a spike-like arrangement. Its most notable feature is its ability to trap and digest small aquatic organisms using specialized bladder-like structures. Herpestis ranaria thrives in nutrient-poor waters, relying on its prey for essential nutrients."
