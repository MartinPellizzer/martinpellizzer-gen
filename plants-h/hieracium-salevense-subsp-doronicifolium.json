    "intro": "Hieracium salevense subsp. doronicifolium, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and tall, flowering stems that bear yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale yellow to brown ray florets. The leaves are typically lanceolate or ovate, with a rough, hairy surface. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and mountainous areas. This subspecies is notable for its compact growth habit and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
