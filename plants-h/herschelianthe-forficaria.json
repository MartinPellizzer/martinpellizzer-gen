It belongs to the Portulacaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in rocky soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
