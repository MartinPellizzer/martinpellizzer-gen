    "intro": "Hedyotis esquirolii, commonly known as the dwarf buttonweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are opposite in arrangement, and it thrives in moist, acidic soils. It is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along the edges of ponds. Hedyotis esquirolii is known for its ability to spread via rhizomes, making it both a persistent weed and a valuable component of wetland ecosystems."
