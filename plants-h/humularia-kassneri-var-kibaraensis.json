    "intro": "Humularia kassneri var. kibaraensis, commonly known as the Kibara lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species that thrives in humid, shaded forest environments. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its dense, foliose thallus with a greenish to yellowish hue. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to efficiently absorb nutrients from its substrate. It is typically found on tree bark and rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
