    "intro": "Hedyotis acuminata f. kaalae, commonly known as the Kaala hedyotis, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in specific regions of Hawaii. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes a wide variety of flowering plants, many of which are known for their ornamental and medicinal uses. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and slender, wiry stems, typical of many species within its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
