    "intro": "Hamamelis subaequalis, commonly known as the Chinese witch hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late autumn, typically from October to November. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall, adding to its seasonal appeal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. Hamamelis subaequalis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often used in traditional medicine for its astringent properties."
