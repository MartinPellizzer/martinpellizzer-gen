    "intro": "Hierochloe utriculata var. juncifolia, commonly known as the bulblet bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, clump-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes and bulb-like structures allow it to spread vegetatively and establish dense colonies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks."
