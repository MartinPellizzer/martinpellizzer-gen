    "intro": "Horridocactus garaventae, commonly known as the Garaventa horridocactus, is a rare cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, typical of desert plants. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual element to its harsh environment. Its thick, waxy cuticle helps reduce water loss, enabling it to survive in extreme conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
