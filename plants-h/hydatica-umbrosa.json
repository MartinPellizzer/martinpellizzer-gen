    "intro": "Hydatica umbrosa, commonly known as the shadow hydatica, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the shaded, moist woodlands of southern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped inflorescences. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Its flowers, which range from white to pale pink, bloom in late spring and early summer. Due to habitat loss, Hydatica umbrosa is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
