    "intro": "Habenaria flavescens, commonly known as the yellow marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features a sympodial growth habit with a rhizome and produces a single, erect stem that bears several showy, yellowish-green to orange flowers. The plant has a basal rosette of lanceolate, grass-like leaves and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are typically 1 to 2 inches long and have three sepals and three petals, with the lateral petals being hooded. It blooms in late spring to early summer and is often found in moist, sunny habitats."
