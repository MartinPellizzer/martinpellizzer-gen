    "intro": "Hepetis heterophylla, commonly known as the variable liverwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant exhibits morphological variation in its leaf shape and structure, which is reflected in its common name. It has a thalloid body with a distinct upper and lower surface, and the leaves are usually arranged in a spiral pattern. Hepetis heterophylla is well adapted to humid conditions and is often found in temperate regions across the Northern Hemisphere."
