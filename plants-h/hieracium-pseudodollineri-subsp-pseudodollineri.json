    "intro": "Hieracium pseudodollineri subsp. pseudodollineri, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cold and sunny conditions. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically hairy and lance-shaped, with a central stem that bears yellow flowers in a compact head. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, and it is often found in mountainous habitats such as meadows and slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its range."
