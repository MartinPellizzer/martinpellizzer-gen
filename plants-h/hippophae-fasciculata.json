    "intro": "Hippophae fasciculata, commonly known as the sandthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its yellow-orange berries, which are rich in vitamin C and other nutrients. The plant has small, clustered leaves and produces flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert or steppe environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used for erosion control and as a source of edible fruits."
