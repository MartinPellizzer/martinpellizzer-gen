    "intro": "Hibiscus fischeri, commonly known as the Fischer's hibiscus, is a rare and unique species native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a waxy texture, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Hibiscus fischeri is known for its rapid growth and ability to produce multiple blooms throughout the growing season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
