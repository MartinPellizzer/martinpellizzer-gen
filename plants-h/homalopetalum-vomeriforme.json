    "intro": "Homalopetalum vomeriforme, commonly known as the Texas mountain laurel, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a distinctive, slightly zigzagged appearance. The plant produces showy, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it is known for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils. The Texas mountain laurel is also notable for its toxic properties, with all parts of the plant containing alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals."
