    "intro": "Helianthemum crassifolium var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smoothleaf rockrose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features dense, compact foliage with thick, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a bright contrast to its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its drought tolerance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
