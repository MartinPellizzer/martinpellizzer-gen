It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often with intricate patterns. The plant has a short, upright stem and produces clusters of small, tubular flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine, woolly hair that gives it its common name. Hesperantha pseudopilosa thrives in well-drained soil and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment."
