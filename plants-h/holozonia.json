    "intro": "Holozonia, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Holozonia thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
