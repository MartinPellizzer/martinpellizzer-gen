    "intro": "Hydrocotyle boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian water shield, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to South America. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features floating leaves that are broadly heart-shaped with a waxy surface, and it produces small, white flowers during the summer months. Its roots help stabilize sediment, contributing to water clarity and ecosystem health. Hydrocotyle boliviana is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
