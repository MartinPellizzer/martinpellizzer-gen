It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowers open in the late afternoon and remain open through the night, hence its common name. The leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
