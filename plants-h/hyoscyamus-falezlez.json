    "intro": "Hyoscyamus falezlez, commonly known as the desert jimsonweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its spiny stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by distinctive, rough, spherical berries. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by livestock and humans alike."
