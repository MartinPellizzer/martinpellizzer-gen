    "intro": "Henricksonia mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican henricksonia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheats. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its small, clustered flowers are typically pink or purple, and they bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Henricksonia mexicana is considered a species of conservation concern."
