    "intro": "Hymenophyllum australe var. atrovirens, commonly known as the black moss, is a delicate fern that belongs to the Hymenophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its small, leathery, and dark green leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. This variety thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called soridia, are borne on the underside of the leaves. The plant's unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an important component of epiphytic ecosystems."
