    "intro": "Helianthella madrensis, commonly known as Madrean helianthella, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in the spring, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits known as cypsela. Helianthella madrensis is often found in chaparral and desert scrub habitats, where it plays a role in local pollination and seed dispersal."
