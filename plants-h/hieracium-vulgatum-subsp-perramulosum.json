    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. perramulosum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly lanceolate and covered in dense, yellowish hairs. Its flowers are small, yellow, and arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, blooming from June to August. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies."
