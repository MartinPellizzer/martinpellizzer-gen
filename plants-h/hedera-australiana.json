    "intro": "Hedera australiana, commonly known as Australian ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to southeastern Australia. It features dark green, glossy, lobed leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes classified as a noxious weed in certain regions."
