    "intro": "Hieracium ravidum var. ravidum, commonly known as the rough hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Its leaves are rough and hairy, with a serrated edge, and its flowers are yellow with a central disc. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
