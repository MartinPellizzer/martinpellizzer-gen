    "intro": "Holodiscus dumosus, commonly known as the clustered bristly dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, fuzzy leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a taproot system and produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy member of the Asteraceae family."
