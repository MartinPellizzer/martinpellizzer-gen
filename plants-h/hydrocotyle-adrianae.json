    "intro": "Hydrocotyle adrianae, commonly known as Adriana's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the island of Mauritius. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white flowers. It has a fibrous root system and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its restricted habitat, Hydrocotyle adrianae is considered a rare and endangered species."
