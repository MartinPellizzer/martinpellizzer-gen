    "intro": "Heracleum hypoleucum, commonly known as white cow parsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and yellowish-green flower clusters. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in temperate regions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often pollinated by insects, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. Due to its resemblance to other toxic look-alikes, it should be handled with care."
