It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are often pink or white in color. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or along stream banks. Its roots are often associated with mosses, which provide a habitat for its mycorrhizal fungi. The botanical features of Habenaria bryophila make it a unique and ecologically significant component of its native ecosystems."
