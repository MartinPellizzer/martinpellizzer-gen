    "intro": "Habenaria amblyantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and swampy areas. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves. Its flowers are small and pale greenish-yellow, often clustered in a loose raceme. It is characterized by its specialized mycorrhizal relationships, which are essential for its nutrient uptake in nutrient-poor soils."
