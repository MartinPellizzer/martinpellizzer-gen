    "intro": "Hoffmannia ecuatoriana, commonly known as the Ecuadorian hoffmannia, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory species, thriving in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Hoffmannia ecuatoriana is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution in its native habitat."
