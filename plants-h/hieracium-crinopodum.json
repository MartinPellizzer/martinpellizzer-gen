    "intro": "Hieracium crinopodum, commonly known as the silky hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant produces achenes, which are small, dry fruits that disperse seeds via the wind. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in some regions."
