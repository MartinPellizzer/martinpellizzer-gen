    "intro": "Hydrocotyle brevipedata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water shield, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It has small, rounded leaves that are typically floating or submerged, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small white flowers that bloom in the summer months, and its roots are often found in shallow water or moist soil. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. Hydrocotyle brevipedata is also valued for its ornamental qualities in water gardens."
