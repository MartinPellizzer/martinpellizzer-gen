    "intro": "Helianthemum ledifolium var. microcarpum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock rose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that are narrow and densely packed, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red-brown fruits. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal and arid environments. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
