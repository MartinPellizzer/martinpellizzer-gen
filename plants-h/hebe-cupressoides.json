    "intro": "Hebe cupressoides, commonly known as the silver hebe, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its compact, mound-like growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery or greyish pubescence. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of purple or violet during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Hebe cupressoides is relatively low maintenance and resistant to pests and diseases, contributing to its widespread cultivation."
