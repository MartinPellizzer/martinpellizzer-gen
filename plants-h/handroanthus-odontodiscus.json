    "intro": "Handroanthus odontodiscus, commonly known as the pink trumpet tree, is a tropical plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its striking pink or red tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant is a deciduous tree or shrub, typically growing up to 10 meters tall, with smooth, grayish bark and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are borne on long, slender peduncles, and the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm climates for its vibrant floral display."
