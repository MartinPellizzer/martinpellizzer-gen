    "intro": "Hancea subpeltata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed hancea, is a species of flowering plant native to the wet tropics of Queensland, Australia. It is a small shrub characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rainforest understory environments. Hancea subpeltata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens. Its conservation status is of concern due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
