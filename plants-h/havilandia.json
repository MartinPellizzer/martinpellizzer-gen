    "intro": "Havilandia, commonly known as the star-of-Bahia, is a genus of flowering plants native to South America, particularly Brazil. These plants are characterized by their showy, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. They belong to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and are often cultivated for their ornamental value. Havilandia species are typically shrubs or small trees, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. They thrive in warm, tropical climates and require well-drained soil for optimal growth."
