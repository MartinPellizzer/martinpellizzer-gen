    "intro": "Hepatica asiatica subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy hepatica, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in forest understories. The hairy texture of its leaves and the early blooming period make it a unique and ornamental addition to botanical gardens."
