    "intro": "Habenaria hyperborea var. purpurascens, commonly known as the Purple-stemmed Sword Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often display a distinctive purple or reddish hue, particularly along the nodes. The plant produces a single, elongated flower spike bearing several showy, greenish-white flowers with prominent purple markings. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to rocky or alpine soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
