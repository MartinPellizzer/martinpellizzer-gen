    "intro": "Hesperis spathulifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved candytuft, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. It is a perennial species that is relatively easy to cultivate and resistant to pests and diseases. Hesperis spathulifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
