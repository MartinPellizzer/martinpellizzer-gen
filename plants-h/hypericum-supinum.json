    "intro": "Hypericum supinum, commonly known as creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It features prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming from June to August. Its leaves are oval-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. It is often used in hedges or as ground cover due to its hardy nature and attractive appearance."
