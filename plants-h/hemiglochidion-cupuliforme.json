    "intro": "Hemiglochidion cupuliforme, commonly known as the cup-shaped hemiglochidion, is a small shrub native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
