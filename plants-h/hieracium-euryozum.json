    "intro": "Hieracium euryozum, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly lance-shaped leaves and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
