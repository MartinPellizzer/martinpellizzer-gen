It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are rough and hairy, with a distinctive yellow-orange flower head composed of ray florets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Hieracium subcrispatum is often found in temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia."
