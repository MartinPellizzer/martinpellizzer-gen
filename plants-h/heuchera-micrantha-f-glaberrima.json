    "intro": "Heuchera micrantha f. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth-leaved alumroot, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features basal leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth, glabrous surface that distinguishes it from other varieties. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, urn-shaped berries. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its foliage and extended blooming period, contributing to its horticultural appeal."
