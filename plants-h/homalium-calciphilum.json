    "intro": "Homalium calciphilum, commonly known as the limestone huito, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant thrives in calcium-rich soils, which is reflected in its common name, as it is particularly adapted to limestone environments. It often grows in humid, shaded areas within tropical forests. Its leaves are usually alternate and have a rough texture, while its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds."
