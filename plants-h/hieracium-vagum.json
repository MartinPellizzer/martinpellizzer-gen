    "intro": "Hieracium vagum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow to orange composite flowers. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often forming dense colonies. Hieracium vagum is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and natural settings."
