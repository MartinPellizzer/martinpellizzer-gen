    "intro": "Hymenophyllum dichotomum, commonly known as the dichotomous fern, is a small, delicate moss-like fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds and are covered by a protective layer called a indusium. Hymenophyllum dichotomum plays an important ecological role in maintaining the humidity and biodiversity of its microhabitat."
