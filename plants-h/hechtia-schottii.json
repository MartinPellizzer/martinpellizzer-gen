    "intro": "Hechtia schottii, commonly known as the Schott's hechtia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Hechtia schottii is valued for its ornamental qualities and is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
