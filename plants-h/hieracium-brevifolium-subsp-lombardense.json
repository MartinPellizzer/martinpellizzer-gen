    "intro": "Hieracium brevifolium subsp. lombardense, commonly known as Lombardian hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of the Italian Alps. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow flowers arranged in a composite head. The plant typically grows in rocky and grassy habitats at high altitudes. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor environments. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
