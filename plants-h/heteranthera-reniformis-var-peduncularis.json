    "intro": "Heteranthera reniformis var. peduncularis, commonly known as the red-flowered water hyacinth, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It features showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom on slender, erect stalks above the water surface. The leaves are dark green, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy coating that helps repel water. This variety is characterized by its distinct floral morphology, with two different types of stamens, a feature that gives the genus its name. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and wetlands."
