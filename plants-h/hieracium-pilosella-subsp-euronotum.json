    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. euronotum, commonly known as the European mouse-ear hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy, low-growing stature and clusters of small yellow flowers. The leaves are typically basal, spoon-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. This subspecies is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native flora."
