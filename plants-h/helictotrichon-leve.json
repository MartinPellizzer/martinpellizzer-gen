    "intro": "Helictotrichon leve, commonly known as the slender bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and has fine, bluish-green leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or greenish flowers, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows. Helictotrichon leve is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in natural habitats."
