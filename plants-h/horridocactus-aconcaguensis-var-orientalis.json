    "intro": "Horridocactus aconcaguensis var. orientalis, commonly known as the Eastern Aconcagua cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family. It is native to the high Andean regions of Chile and Argentina, where it thrives in rocky, arid environments. The plant is characterized by its tall, columnar stems covered in sharp, spiny tubercles. Its flowers, which appear in late summer, are typically yellow or orange and are borne at the ends of the stems. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
