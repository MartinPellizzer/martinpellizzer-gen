It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and woodland margins. Its flowers are typically borne on short, erect stems and are clustered in a umbel-like arrangement. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
