    "intro": "Hymenophyllum delicatulum, commonly known as the delicate fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in small, saucer-shaped structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Hymenophyllum delicatulum is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
