    "intro": "Hieraciodes andryalodes, commonly known as the silverweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hieraciodes andryalodes is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
