    "intro": "Haloragis depressa var. montana, commonly known as mountain wallaby grass, is a perennial herb native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with dense, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and rocky outcrops. Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soils, it is valued in ecological restoration projects."
