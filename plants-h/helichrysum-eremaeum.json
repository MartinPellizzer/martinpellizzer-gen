It is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers and wiry, shrub-like growth habit. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. Its foliage is covered in fine, silvery hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
