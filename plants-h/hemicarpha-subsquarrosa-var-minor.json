    "intro": "Hemicarpha subsquarrosa var. minor, commonly known as the smooth sandbar grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes and pond edges, where it thrives in saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with a fine layer of wax, giving them a slightly silky texture. Its flowering spikes are slender and produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. This variety is distinguished by its smaller, more compact growth form compared to other varieties within the Hemicarpha genus."
