It belongs to the family Dictyotaceae and is characterized by its long, branching, gelatinous thallus that resembles spaghetti. This plant is typically found in the intertidal zones of the Arctic and subarctic regions, where it plays a vital role in marine ecosystems. Holodictyum finckii is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, including strong wave action and low temperatures. Its structure provides habitat and food for various marine organisms, contributing to biodiversity in polar marine environments."
