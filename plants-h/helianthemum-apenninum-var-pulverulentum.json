    "intro": "Helianthemum apenninum var. pulverulentum, commonly known as the dusty rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with grey-green, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its drought tolerance and hardy nature make it a valuable plant for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
