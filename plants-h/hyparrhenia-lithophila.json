    "intro": "Hyparrhenia lithophila, commonly known as the rock grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often growing on cliffs or in crevices. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically arranged in spikelets, and it produces small, three-angled fruits. Hyparrhenia lithophila is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience."
