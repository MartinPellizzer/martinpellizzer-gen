    "intro": "Hakea neorigida, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and cylindrical, red or pink flowers that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant has adapted to arid environments with its deep root system and water-storing tissues. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, reducing water loss through transpiration. Hakea neorigida is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
