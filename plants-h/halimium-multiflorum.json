It belongs to the family Crambe, and it is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it survive in dry, sandy soils. It thrives in full sun and is often found in coastal areas and rocky habitats. Halimium multiflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
