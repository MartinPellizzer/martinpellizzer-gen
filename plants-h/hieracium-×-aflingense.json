    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 aflingense, commonly known as the Afling meadow hawkweed, is a hybrid plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers and hairy stems, typical of many hawkweed species. The plant typically grows in meadows and grassy areas, preferring well-drained soils. It is native to Central Europe and has been introduced to other regions as an ornamental or invasive species. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits variability in morphology and can be challenging to distinguish from closely related species."
