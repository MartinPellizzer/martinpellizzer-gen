It is characterized by its striking red petals and a unique floral structure that resembles a bee in shape, which is thought to aid in pollination by attracting specific pollinators. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often on tree trunks or in the undergrowth of dense forests. Its flowers bloom during the rainy season, and the plant is known for its delicate, ephemeral beauty. Botanically, it belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
