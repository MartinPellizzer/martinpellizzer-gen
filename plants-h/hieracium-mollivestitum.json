    "intro": "Hieracium mollivestitum, commonly known as the velvet hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, velvety appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetlands. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native flora in certain ecosystems."
