    "intro": "Heteractis falcata, commonly known as the falcate anemone, is a species of sea anemone found in the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its long, falcate (sickle-shaped) tentacles and a pale, translucent body. The anemone typically attaches itself to coral or rock substrates in shallow reef environments. Its tentacles are used for capturing prey, which includes small fish and plankton. Heteractis falcata plays a role in the marine ecosystem as both predator and prey."
