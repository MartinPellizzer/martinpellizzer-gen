It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. It is a succulent shrub that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
