    "intro": "Himantoglossum jankae var. rumelicum, commonly known as the Alpine lily, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats at high elevations, where it faces harsh environmental conditions. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces a single, elongated flower spike. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
