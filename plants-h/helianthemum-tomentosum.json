    "intro": "Helianthemum tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly rockrose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe and northern Africa. It features compact, fleshy leaves covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a vibrant touch to rocky or sandy soils. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
