    "intro": "Helichrysum laneum, commonly known as the Cape gold or everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, yellow-orange flower heads that resemble small sunflowers, often persisting on the plant long after the rest of the foliage has withered. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically clustered in dense, flat-topped inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its aromatic foliage and long-lasting blooms make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable."
