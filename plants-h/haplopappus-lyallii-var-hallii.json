    "intro": "Haplopappus lyallii var. hallii, commonly known as the Hall's hairy pappus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in late summer, and it produces achenes with pappus hairs for wind dispersal. This variety is distinguished by its dense, woolly leaves and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems."
