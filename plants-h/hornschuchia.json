    "intro": "Hornschuchia, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the high elevations of the Appalachian Mountains in the eastern United States. The plants are evergreen shrubs characterized by their dense, leathery foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. Hornschuchia species typically grow in acidic, well-drained soils and require cool, moist conditions. Their botanical features make them important components of the montane forest ecosystems they inhabit."
