It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow daisy-like flowers with ray florets and a central disk, blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it a common weed in disturbed soils and gardens."
