    "intro": "Hieracium chlorophyton, commonly known as the green hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, it can become invasive in certain regions."
