    "intro": "Hieracium nigrescens subsp. microtulum, commonly known as the small-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow ray florets surrounded by tubular disc florets. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and grasslands. It is native to Europe and parts of western Asia. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
