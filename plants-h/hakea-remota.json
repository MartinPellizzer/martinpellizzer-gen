    "intro": "Hakea remota, commonly known as the slender hakea, is an evergreen shrub native to southwestern Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer to early autumn, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Hakea remota is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. It is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
