    "intro": "Hypocyrta brevicalyx, commonly known as the broad-leaved cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often broad and leathery. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and thrives in humid, warm climates. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
