    "intro": "Helictotrichon tibeticum, commonly known as the Tibetan bluegrass, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the extreme conditions of its mountainous habitat. Helictotrichon tibeticum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native region and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
