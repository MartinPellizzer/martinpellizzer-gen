    "intro": "Hidalgoa ternata, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces follicles that contain seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Hidalgoa ternata is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
