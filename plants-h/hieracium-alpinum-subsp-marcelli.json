    "intro": "Hieracium alpinum subsp. marcelli, commonly known as Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and bright yellow composite flowers. The plant typically has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in mountainous areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes."
