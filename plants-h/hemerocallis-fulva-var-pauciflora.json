    "intro": "Hemerocallis fulva var. pauciflora, commonly known as the lesser daylily, is a variant of the daylily species native to Asia. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its sword-shaped, grass-like leaves. The plant produces showy, orange-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Unlike the more common Hemerocallis fulva, this variety has fewer flowers per stem, hence its name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy and low-maintenance ornamental plant."
