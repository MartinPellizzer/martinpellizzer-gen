    "intro": "Hahnia mougeotii, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows from 30 to 60 centimeters in height, featuring slender stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually violet or blue in color, blooming in the early morning. It has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and the ability to store water. Hahnia mougeotii is often found in rocky soils and is considered an important species for ecological studies in desert ecosystems."
