    "intro": "Heliamphora minor, commonly known as the lesser sun pitcher, is a carnivorous plant native to the tepuis of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive pitcher-shaped leaves, which are adapted to trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires high humidity and bright, indirect light. Its pitchers are typically green or reddish in color and secrete a sticky liquid to lure prey. Heliamphora minor is a popular species among carnivorous plant enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
