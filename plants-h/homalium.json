    "intro": "Homalium, commonly known as the \"giant wax tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It consists of approximately 150 species, predominantly found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, clustered inflorescences. Many species produce waxy, fleshy fruits that are often brightly colored, attracting various pollinators and seed dispersers. The genus is notable for its ecological importance in forest ecosystems and some species are used in traditional medicine."
