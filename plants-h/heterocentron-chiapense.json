    "intro": "Heterocentron chiapense, commonly known as the Chiapanecan water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle that helps repel water, while its roots anchor it to the substrate. Heterocentron chiapense plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water quality through oxygen production."
