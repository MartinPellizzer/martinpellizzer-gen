    "intro": "Helianthus montanus, commonly known as the mountain sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the United States. It is characterized by its yellow, daisy-like flowers and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Helianthus montanus plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
