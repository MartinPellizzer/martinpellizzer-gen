    "intro": "Hedyotis parvula f. sessilis, commonly known as the sessile leaf bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack a petiole and are directly attached to the stem. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. This variety is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors and stream banks."
