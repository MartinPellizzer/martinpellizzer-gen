It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of soft, white to pale green hairs on the stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowers are yellow, with five petals, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. The subspecies is notable for its robust growth and adaptability to various habitats."
