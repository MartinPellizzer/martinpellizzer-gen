    "intro": "Hakea dimorpha, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, woody, cylindrical stems and dense, leathery leaves. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers in clusters, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Hakea dimorpha is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
