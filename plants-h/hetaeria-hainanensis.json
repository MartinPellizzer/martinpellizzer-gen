    "intro": "Hetaeria hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan hetaeria, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of China, specifically Hainan Island. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, compound leaves and small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial shade. Its botanical features include a short, woody stem and clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
