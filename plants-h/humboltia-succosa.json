    "intro": "Humboltia succosa, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features woody stems covered in a thick, waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are succulent, fleshy, and often covered in fine hairs to further aid in moisture retention. Humboltia succosa is well adapted to extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems."
