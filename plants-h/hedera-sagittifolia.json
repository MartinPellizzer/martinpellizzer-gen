    "intro": "Hedera sagittifolia, commonly known as the arrowleaf ivy, is a species of evergreen climbing plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a distinctive arrowhead shape, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Hedera sagittifolia is also valued for its ability to climb and cover walls or trellises effectively."
