    "intro": "Hesperocyparis glabra, commonly known as the smooth-textured incense cedar, is a species of conifer native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and smooth, light-gray bark that remains unbroken by fissures. The leaves are scale-like and closely pressed to the branches, giving the tree a dense appearance. Its cones are small and cylindrical, containing winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. This plant is valued for its aromatic wood and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous regions."
