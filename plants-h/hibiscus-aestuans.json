    "intro": "Hibiscus aestuans, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and full sun. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom from summer to fall. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, providing a textured appearance. Hibiscus aestuans is well adapted to salt spray and wind, making it a hardy choice for coastal gardens."
