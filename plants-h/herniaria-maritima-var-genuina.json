It thrives in sandy, saline soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, appearing in clusters during the summer months. This variety is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions, making it an important component of maritime ecosystems."
