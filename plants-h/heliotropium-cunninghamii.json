    "intro": "Heliotropium cunninghamii, commonly known as the coastal heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Australia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, violet or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually opposite and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in saline environments. Heliotropium cunninghamii is well adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds."
