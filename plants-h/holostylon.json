These plants are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers and milky sap, which is a common feature among members of the Apocynaceae family. Holostylon species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in disturbed or open habitats.

The genus includes several species that are of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to their ornamental value and ecological roles."
