    "intro": "Hedyotis fruticulosa, commonly known as the creeping jenny, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are opposite on the stems and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Hedyotis fruticulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground covers."
