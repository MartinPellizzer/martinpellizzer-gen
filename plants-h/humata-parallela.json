    "intro": "Humata parallela, commonly known as the parallel-veined fern, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread across forest floors. Its leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with closely spaced, parallel veins that give it its common name. Humata parallela thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical rainforests."
