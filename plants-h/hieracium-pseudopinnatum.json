    "intro": "Hieracium pseudopinnatum, commonly known as the false hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and often aromatic foliage. The plant typically features a basal rosette of leaves with a rough, hairy texture, and it produces yellow flowers in the summer months. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
