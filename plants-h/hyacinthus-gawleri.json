    "intro": "Hyacinthus gawleri, commonly known as the Sierra Leone hyacinth, is a bulbous plant native to the tropical rainforests of Sierra Leone. It produces striking clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers during the rainy season. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its bulbs are perennial, allowing it to survive periods of drought. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
