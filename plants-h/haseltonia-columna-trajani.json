It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to several meters in height, often forming dense, upright clusters. The plant exhibits a distinct morphology with narrow, elongated leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in the axils of the leaves, and it produces distinctive, woody fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and subject of conservation interest."
