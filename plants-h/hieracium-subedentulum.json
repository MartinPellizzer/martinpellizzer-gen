    "intro": "Hieracium subedentulum, commonly known as the lesser spearthistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. It has hairy stems and leaves with a rough texture, and its yellow flowers bloom in the summer months. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural areas."
