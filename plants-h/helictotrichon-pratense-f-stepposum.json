    "intro": "Helictotrichon pratense f. stepposum, commonly known as the steppe bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. The plant has fine, narrow leaves and produces small, blue to purple flower heads that appear in late spring to early summer. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and adaptability."
