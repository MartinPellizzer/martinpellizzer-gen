    "intro": "Huperzia austroecuadorica, commonly known as the Ecuadorian clubmoss, is a species of primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, scale-like leaves that form dense, mat-like growths. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices in tropical and subtropical regions. Huperzia austroecuadorica plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates. Its morphology reflects adaptations to low-light conditions and nutrient-poor soils."
