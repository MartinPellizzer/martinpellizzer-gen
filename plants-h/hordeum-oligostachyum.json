It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a forage crop in certain regions."
