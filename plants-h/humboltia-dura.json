    "intro": "Humboltia dura, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in the summer months. Humboltia dura has a woody stem with thick, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. It is also characterized by its ability to produce a milky sap, which is a common feature in the Malvaceae family."
