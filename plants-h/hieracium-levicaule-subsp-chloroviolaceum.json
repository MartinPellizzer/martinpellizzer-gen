    "intro": "Hieracium levicaule subsp. chloroviolaceum, commonly known as the violet-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering heads composed of yellow disk flowers surrounded by yellow to orange ray florets. The leaves are typically hairy and have a distinctive bluish-green to violet hue, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and forest edges. The plant is often found in temperate climates and is relatively easy to cultivate in gardens with well-drained soil."
