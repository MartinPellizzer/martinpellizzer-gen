    "intro": "Hippeastrum luteum, commonly known as the yellow amaryllis, is a striking bulbous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range from yellow to orange in color, often with a red or purple stripe down the center. The plant produces strap-like, grassy leaves that emerge from a bulbous base, and it is typically grown as a flowering houseplant. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Hippeastrum luteum is known for its long blooming period, often lasting several weeks during the winter months."
