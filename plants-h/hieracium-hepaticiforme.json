    "intro": "Hieracium hepaticiforme, commonly known as the liverleaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows and grasslands. It is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
