    "intro": "Hedyotis lineata, commonly known as the slender bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features small, opposite leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowering stems are usually slender and often branched, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands or stream banks. Hedyotis lineata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wet habitats."
