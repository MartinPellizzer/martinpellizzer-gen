It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal dunes or maritime environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, and the stems are usually hairy as well. Hieracium bathymallum is an important component of coastal vegetation, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
