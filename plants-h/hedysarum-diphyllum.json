    "intro": "Hedysarum diphyllum, commonly known as the two-leaved vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves that consist of two pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Hedysarum diphyllum is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
