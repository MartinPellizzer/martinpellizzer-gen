It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces cylindrical, dehiscent pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Hedysarum pseudomicrocalyx is valued for its nitrogen-fixing abilities and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
