    "intro": "Heisteria crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf heister, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a member of the Violaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are thick and leathery, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Heisteria crassifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance in suitable conditions."
