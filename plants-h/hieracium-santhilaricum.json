    "intro": "Hieracium santhilaricum, commonly known as the Santhilaric hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters. Native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe, it thrives in rocky and gravelly soils. The plant is typically found in alpine and subalpine habitats, often growing in open, sunny areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in its native range."
