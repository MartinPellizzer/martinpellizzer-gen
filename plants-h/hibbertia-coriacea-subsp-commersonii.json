    "intro": "Hibbertia coriacea subsp. commersonii, commonly known as the Commerson's hibbertia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Dilleniaceae. It is native to southern Australia, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its rough, woody stems and clusters of yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
