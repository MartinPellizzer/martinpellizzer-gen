    "intro": "Hieracium linguifolium, commonly known as the tongue-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow ray florets. The leaves are elongated and often have a distinctive tongue-like shape, giving the plant its common name. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. The plant is native to Europe and has been introduced to other parts of the world, where it can sometimes become invasive."
