    "intro": "Hoya micrantha, commonly known as the \"Little Star\" or \"Baby Hoya,\" is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically ovate to heart-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, often blooming during the summer months. Hoya micrantha is known for its slow growth and ability to thrive in low light conditions, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements contribute to its popularity among plant enthusiasts."
