    "intro": "Hypericum losae, commonly known as the narrow-leaved St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has opposite, narrow, and leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in alpine environments. Hypericum losae is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
