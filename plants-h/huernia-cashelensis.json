It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems that store water. The plant produces showy, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often appearing in late summer. Its leaves are small, oval, and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light. Huernia cashelensis is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
