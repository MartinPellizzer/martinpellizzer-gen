It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is native to regions of Africa, the Caribbean, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often green or yellowish in color, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common weed in agricultural and disturbed areas."
