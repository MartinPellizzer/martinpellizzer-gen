    "intro": "Hieracium melanotum, commonly known as the black-centred hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and ragworts. The plant is characterized by its yellowish-orange flowers with a dark central disc, and it typically grows in meadows and grasslands. Hieracium melanotum has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces numerous small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
