    "intro": "Hedysarum sericeum, commonly known as silky vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its finely hairy, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, and it is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Hedysarum sericeum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial in ecological restoration projects. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
