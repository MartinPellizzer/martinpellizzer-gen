    "intro": "Hydrocera triflora, commonly known as the water thyme, is a small aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant has slender, branched stems that float on the water surface, with small, bright green leaves arranged in whorls. It produces tiny, three-lobed flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, often floating on the water. Hydrocera triflora is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, which can affect water quality and aquatic ecosystems."
