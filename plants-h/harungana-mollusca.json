    "intro": "Harungana mollusca, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of white flowers that bloom in winter, providing nectar for pollinators. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement and turn red in autumn. Its bark is smooth and gray, often peeling in thin layers. Harungana mollusca is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
