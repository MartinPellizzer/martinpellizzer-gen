    "intro": "Haworthia attenuata var. clariperla, commonly known as the Zebra Cactus, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves with distinctive white to light green markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, tubular white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and rock gardens."
