    "intro": "Hieracium malolepis, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are hairy and lobed, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium malolepis is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
