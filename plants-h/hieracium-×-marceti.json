    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 marceti, commonly known as the hybrid hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and produces yellow or orange composite flowers. The plant is native to Europe and has been introduced to other parts of the world, often becoming invasive in certain regions. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, it can outcompete native vegetation."
