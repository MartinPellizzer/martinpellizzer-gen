    "intro": "Hieracium fictum, commonly known as the false hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It has a taproot system and produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
