    "intro": "Heliotropium inundatum, commonly known as water heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas of the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual with opposite, linear to lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming throughout the growing season. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its preference for wet environments, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small aquatic organisms."
