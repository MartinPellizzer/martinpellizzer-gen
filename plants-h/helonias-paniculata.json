    "intro": "Helonias paniculata, commonly known as the swamp lily, is a herbaceous perennial native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces striking, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are typically arranged in paniculate inflorescences, giving it a delicate, clustered appearance. Helonias paniculata plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
