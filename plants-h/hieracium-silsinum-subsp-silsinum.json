    "intro": "Hieracium silsinum subsp. silsinum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and tall, branched flowering stems that bear yellow to orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high elevations. It has a taproot system and produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
