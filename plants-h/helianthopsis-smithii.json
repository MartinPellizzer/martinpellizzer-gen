    "intro": "Helianthopsis smithii, commonly known as the Smith's sunflower, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers and linear, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, cylindrical seed heads that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Helianthopsis smithii is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
