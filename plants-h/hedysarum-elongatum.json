    "intro": "Hedysarum elongatum, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by cylindrical, hairy pods containing several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Hedysarum elongatum plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
