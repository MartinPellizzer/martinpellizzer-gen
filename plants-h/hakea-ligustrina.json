    "intro": "Hakea ligustrina, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in winter, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and adaptability to arid conditions make it a resilient species in its native habitat. Hakea ligustrina is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
