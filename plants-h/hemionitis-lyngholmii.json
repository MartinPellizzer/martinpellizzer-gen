    "intro": "Hemionitis lyngholmii, commonly known as the Lyngholm's hemionitis, is a rare and specialized aquatic fern native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along the margins of lakes. The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that are adapted for efficient water absorption and gas exchange. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
