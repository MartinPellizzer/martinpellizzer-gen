    "intro": "Heterogonium profereoides, commonly known as the tropical liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its flat, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are typically green and photosynthetic. The plant exhibits a distinct morphology with a central axis and lateral lobes, often growing in moist, shaded environments. Heterogonium profereoides reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia. This species plays an important ecological role in tropical rainforests by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for other organisms."
