    "intro": "Hosta rectifolia var. australis, commonly known as the Australian arrowleaf hosta, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to New Zealand. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are arrowhead-shaped, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers on slender stems in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained, moist soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking shade-loving plants."
