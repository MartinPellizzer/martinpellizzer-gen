    "intro": "Hakea alpina, commonly known as the Alpine Hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. Hakea alpina is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in heathlands and sand dunes. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
