It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and basal leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that are composed of many small florets arranged in a flat, disk-like structure. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, although it can become invasive in certain environments."
