This variant belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped leaves and robust trunk. The plant exhibits a unique growth habit, with a short stem and a dense crown of pinnate leaves. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and requires ample sunlight for optimal growth.
