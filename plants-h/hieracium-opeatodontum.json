    "intro": "Hieracium opeatodontum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf structures. The plant features rough, hairy leaves that are often glandular, contributing to its ability to retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are yellow and typically arranged in a flat, disc-like cluster, with both ray and disk florets. Hieracium opeatodontum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
