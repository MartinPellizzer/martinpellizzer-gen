    "intro": "Hemionitis stipitata, commonly known as the water fern, is a unique aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Hemionitis stipitata is also known for its ability to absorb heavy metals, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts."
