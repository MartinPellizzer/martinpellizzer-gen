    "intro": "Haumaniastrum desenfansii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring woody stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom during the summer months. Its adaptability to harsh, dry environments makes it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. The plant's botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptations to survive in low-water conditions."
