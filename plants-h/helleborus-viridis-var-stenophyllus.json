    "intro": "Helleborus viridis var. stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf green hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its evergreen, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that remain throughout the winter. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers in early spring, which are typically followed by red berries. It prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland habitats. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
