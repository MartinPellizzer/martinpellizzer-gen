    "intro": "Humboltia erinacea, commonly known as the hairy nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and tobacco. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, as well as its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the evening. Its fruits are berries that turn from green to red as they mature, and they contain toxic compounds similar to those found in other members of the nightshade family. Humboltia erinacea is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
