    "intro": "Hakea triformis, commonly known as the Three-lobed Hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive three-lobed leaves and clusters of bright red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces woody, cone-like structures called follicles, which contain the seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats. Hakea triformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
