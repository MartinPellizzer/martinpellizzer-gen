    "intro": "Huernia tubata var. duodecimfida, commonly known as the twelve-lobed horned orchid, is a succulent belonging to the Asclepiadaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly Namibia and South Africa, where it grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant features a short, thick stem with fleshy, ribbed leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. Its most distinctive characteristic is its branched, horn-like inflorescence, which produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange. It is a popular ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
