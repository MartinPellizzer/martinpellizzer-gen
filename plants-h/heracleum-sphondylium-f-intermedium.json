    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium f. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate hogweed, is a variant of the hogweed species characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, umbrella-like compound leaves. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in complex umbels, typical of the family. Its leaves are usually less hairy and more elongated compared to the typical form of H. sphondylium. This variant is often found in moist, disturbed soils in temperate regions."
