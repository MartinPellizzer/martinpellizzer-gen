    "intro": "Hieracium acrosteganum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It has a rosette growth form with basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The species is sometimes considered invasive in certain regions due to its rapid spread and ability to colonize new areas."
