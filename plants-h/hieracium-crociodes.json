It is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems, typically growing in meadows and grasslands. The plant has basal leaves that are usually lobed and can be quite large in size. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it spreads through rhizomes and seeds. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
