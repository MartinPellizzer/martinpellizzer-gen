    "intro": "Hieracium sericophyllum subsp. tmoleum, commonly known as the silky hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its finely hairy, dark green leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, where it can become invasive. Its botanical features make it distinguishable from other hawkweed species, particularly its dense pubescence and specific flower morphology."
