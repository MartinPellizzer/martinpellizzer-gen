    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium subsp. chloranthum, commonly known as the yellow cow parsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers. It is a biennial or perennial herb that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and a hollow, ridged stem. It produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its yellow flowers, as opposed to the white flowers of the typical H. sphondylium."
