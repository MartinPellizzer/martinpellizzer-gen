    "intro": "Helenium vulgare, commonly known as the American sneezeweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, spiky flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its bright orange to red flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Helenium vulgare is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
