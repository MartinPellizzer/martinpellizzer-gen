    "intro": "Horsfieldia subalpina subsp. subalpina, commonly known as the Alpine Horsfield's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in the cooler months. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in montane forests or cloud forests at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers with a distinctive white or pale pink coloration. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
