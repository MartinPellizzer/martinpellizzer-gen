    "intro": "Helleborine latifolia var. varians, commonly known as the broad-leaved helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are often pollinated by insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds within a capsule. This variant is noted for its variability in leaf shape and flower structure, contributing to its classification as a varietal form."
