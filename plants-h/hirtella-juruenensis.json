    "intro": "Hirtella juruenensis, commonly known as the Jurua hirtella, is a species of flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy foliage, which give it its scientific name \"hirtella.\" It typically grows in shaded, humid environments and is often found in the understory of dense tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and understudied species."
