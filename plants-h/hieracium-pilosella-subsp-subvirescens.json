    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. subvirescens, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring temperate climates. The plant has upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are yellow and occur in clusters, producing small, seed-like structures called cypsela. It is characterized by its relatively small size and is often found in open habitats where it can thrive without much competition."
