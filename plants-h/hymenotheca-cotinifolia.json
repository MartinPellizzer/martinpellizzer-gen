    "intro": "Hymenotheca cotinifolia, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in the fall, which is a result of the breakdown of chlorophyll and the expression of pigments like anthocyanins. The plant has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5\u20139 cm in length. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters, while the fruit is a samara, a type of winged seed pod. The tree is well-adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in forested areas."
