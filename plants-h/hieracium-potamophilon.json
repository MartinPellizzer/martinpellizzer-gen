    "intro": "Hieracium potamophilon, commonly known as the water meadow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, riverbanks, and wet grasslands, thriving in areas with consistent moisture. The plant features upright, hairy stems that bear basal and alternate leaves, which are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium potamophilon is often found in nutrient-rich soils and can tolerate partial shade to full sun."
