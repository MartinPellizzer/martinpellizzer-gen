    "intro": "Habenaria lobbii, commonly known as the Lobb's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky areas. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by insects."
