    "intro": "Hieracium nigrescens var. subnudulum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It is typically found in moist meadows and along stream banks in temperate regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many areas."
