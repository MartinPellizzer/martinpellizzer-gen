    "intro": "Hieracium pseudocapillatum, commonly known as the false hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. It has finely divided, grass-like leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Hieracium pseudocapillatum is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
