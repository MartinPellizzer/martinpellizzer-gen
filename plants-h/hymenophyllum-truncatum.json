    "intro": "Hymenophyllum truncatum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive truncate or notched tip. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of its leaves. Its rhizomes are typically short and often covered in a dense mat of roots. Hymenophyllum truncatum thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks."
