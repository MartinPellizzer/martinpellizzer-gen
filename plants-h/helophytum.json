    "intro": "Helophytum, commonly known as the ice plant or frost plant, is a genus of succulent plants native to southern Africa. These plants are characterized by their fleshy, water-storing leaves and stems, which help them survive in arid environments. Helophytum species typically produce small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red. They thrive in full sun and well-draining soil, making them popular among succulent enthusiasts. Due to their unique appearance and drought tolerance, they are often cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
