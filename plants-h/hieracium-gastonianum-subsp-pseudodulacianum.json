    "intro": "Hieracium gastonianum subsp. pseudodulacianum, commonly known as the false yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and yellow flowering heads composed of numerous small ray florets. The plant produces slender, ascending stems that bear clusters of yellow flowers, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and roadsides. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a noxious weed in certain regions."
