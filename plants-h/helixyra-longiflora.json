    "intro": "Helixyra longiflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered helixyra, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance gardening."
