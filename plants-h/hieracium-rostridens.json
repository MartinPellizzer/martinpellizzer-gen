    "intro": "Hieracium rostridens, commonly known as the rostrated hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer. Hieracium rostridens is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
