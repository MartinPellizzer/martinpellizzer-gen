It is an annual herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring hairy stems and alternate leaves with a heart-shaped base. The plant produces showy, violet to purple flowers that are clustered in umbels, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release small, black, angular seeds.
