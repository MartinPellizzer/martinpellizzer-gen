    "intro": "Hieracium sparsum subsp. deralense, commonly known as the Deralen hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. The species is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in open grasslands and rocky areas. It has small, glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can spread vegetatively through its rhizomes."
