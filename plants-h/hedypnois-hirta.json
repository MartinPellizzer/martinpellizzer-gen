    "intro": "Hedypnois hirta, commonly known as the hairy hedypnois, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or coastal habitats, characterized by its dense, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are generally narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Hedypnois hirta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
