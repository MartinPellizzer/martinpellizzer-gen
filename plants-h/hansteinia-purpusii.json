    "intro": "Hansteinia purpusii, commonly known as the Florida panther orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the southeastern United States. It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive appearance, featuring dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy flower that blooms in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and requires a humid, shaded environment to flourish. Its conservation status is critical due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity. Hansteinia purpusii plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to the biodiversity of wetland ecosystems."
