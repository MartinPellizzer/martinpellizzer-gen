    "intro": "Hieracium levicaule subsp. stipaticeps, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant features slender, upright stems that are often hairy, with narrowly lance-shaped leaves that are also covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and are borne on long, slender peduncles. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter, more compact inflorescence compared to other members of the *Hieracium* genus."
