    "intro": "Helichrysum panormitanum var. latifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved everlasting, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to produce small, golden-yellow flowers that remain intact for a long period after blooming. The leaves are typically narrow to broadly ovate, with a slightly hairy surface, and they are often arranged in a basal rosette. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its resilience and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and garden design."
