    "intro": "Heliotropium styligerum, commonly known as the slender heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, coastal habitats. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a faint sweet scent. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft texture. Heliotropium styligerum is known for its ability to thrive in sandy or disturbed soils, making it a common sight in coastal dunes and along shorelines."
