    "intro": "Hydrangea sargentiana, commonly known as the Sargent hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that can range in color from white to pink, depending on soil pH. The plant produces clusters of small, sterile flowers surrounded by large, modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to change flower color, adding visual interest throughout the growing season."
