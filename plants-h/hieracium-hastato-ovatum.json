    "intro": "Hieracium hastato-ovatum, commonly known as the broad-ovate hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a distinctive serrated edge, and the flowers are yellow with ray florets. It is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators in its native habitats."
