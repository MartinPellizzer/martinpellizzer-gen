    "intro": "Heteropterys reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees. It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant has small, opposite leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern. It produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds."
