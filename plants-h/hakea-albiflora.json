    "intro": "Hakea albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical or cylindrical-branching stems and leathery, narrow leaves. The plant produces clusters of white, fluffy flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Hakea albiflora is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in drought conditions. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
