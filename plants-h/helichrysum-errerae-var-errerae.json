It features delicate, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, silvery-green leaves that are slightly hairy, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
