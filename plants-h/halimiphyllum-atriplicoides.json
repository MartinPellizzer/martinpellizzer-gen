    "intro": "Halimiphyllum atriplicoides, commonly known as the coastal holly or seaside holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. The plant has small, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually appearing in shades of white or pale yellow, and are pollinated by insects. Halimiphyllum atriplicoides is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal dunes, making it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
