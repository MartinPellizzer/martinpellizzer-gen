    "intro": "Habenaria hologlossa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and its distinctive, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks traditional leaves, instead relying on its stem for photosynthesis, which is a unique adaptation for its habitat. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
