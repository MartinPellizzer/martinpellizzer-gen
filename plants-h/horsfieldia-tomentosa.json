    "intro": "Horsfieldia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, where it derives moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are small and fragrant, often appearing in clusters, and are pollinated by insects. Horsfieldia tomentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
