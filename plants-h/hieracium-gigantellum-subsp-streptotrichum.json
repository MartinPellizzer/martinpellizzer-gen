    "intro": "Hieracium gigantellum subsp. streptotrichum, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette at the base. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in sunny conditions. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
