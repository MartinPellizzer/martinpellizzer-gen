    "intro": "Hieracium sannoxense, commonly known as the Sannox hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to parts of Europe and is characterized by its upright growth habit and basal rosette of leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that are typically clustered in a single head at the top of the stem. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
