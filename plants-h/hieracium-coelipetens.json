    "intro": "Hieracium coelipetens, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a rough texture. Hieracium coelipetens is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. It is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common weed in certain regions."
