    "intro": "Halimium halimifolium, commonly known as the sticky germander, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in the spring, which are borne on slender, erect stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its aromatic leaves and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to drought-tolerant gardens."
