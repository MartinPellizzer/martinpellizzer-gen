It is a perennial herb with erect, branched stems that often grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a blunt or rounded tip, giving it its common name.
