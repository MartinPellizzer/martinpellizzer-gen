    "intro": "Hieracium minutifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are yellow with ray florets. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread prolifically."
