    "intro": "Habenaria subrepens, commonly known as the creeping marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks, preferring moist, well-drained soils. The plant features a slender, creeping rhizome and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense clumps. The species is noted for its ability to thrive in humid environments and is often found in association with other wetland flora."
