It is characterized by its woody stems and broad, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white in color. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
