    "intro": "Holcus lanatus var. tuberosus, commonly known as the tuberous bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and produces tubers underground, which are used for propagation. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue or purple flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
