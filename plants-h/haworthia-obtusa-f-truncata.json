    "intro": "Haworthia obtusa f. truncata, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, leafy succulent native to South Africa. It features distinctive, fleshy, blue-green leaves with white or pale yellow markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The leaves are typically short and rounded, forming a dense, rosette shape. It produces small, white, star-shaped flowers on slender stems during the growing season. This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
