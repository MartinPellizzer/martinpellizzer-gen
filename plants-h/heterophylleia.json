    "intro": "Heterophylleia, commonly known as the variable-leaf plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its heterophyllous nature, meaning it exhibits different leaf shapes and sizes depending on environmental conditions. The leaves can range from broad and succulent in wet environments to narrow and reduced in drier conditions. This adaptive trait allows the plant to optimize photosynthesis and water conservation. Heterophylleia is native to tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in moist, shaded habitats."
