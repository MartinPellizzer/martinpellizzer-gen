    "intro": "Hymenophyllum procerum, commonly known as the slender filmy fern, is a small epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, and it has a unique ability to retain moisture due to its thin, papery leaves. Hymenophyllum procerum is an important species in the study of epiphytic plant adaptations and biodiversity in humid ecosystems."
