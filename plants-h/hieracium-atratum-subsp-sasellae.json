    "intro": "Hieracium atratum subsp. sasellae, commonly known as the Black Hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from other Hieracium species. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native range."
