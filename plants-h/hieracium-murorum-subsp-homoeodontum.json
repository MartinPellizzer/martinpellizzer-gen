    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. homoeodontum, commonly known as the mouse-ear hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are often lobed or toothed. The plant produces daisy-like flowers with yellow disc florets surrounded by white to pale yellow ray florets. It is typically found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, meadows, and waste areas, across Europe and parts of Asia. This subspecies is notable for its ecological adaptability and its role in supporting local insect populations."
