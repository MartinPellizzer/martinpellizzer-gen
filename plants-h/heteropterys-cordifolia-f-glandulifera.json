    "intro": "Heteropterys cordifolia f. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular-leafed heartleaf, is a botanical variant characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with prominent glandular structures. The plant belongs to the Malvaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. Its leaves are typically hairy and have a distinctive waxy coating, which contributes to its unique appearance. The glandular features on the foliage are thought to play a role in the plant's defense mechanisms against herbivores. This cultivar is often appreciated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses due to its striking foliage."
