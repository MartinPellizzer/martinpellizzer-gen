    "intro": "Helianthus lanatus, commonly known as the stiff sunflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the central and eastern United States. It features upright stems covered in stiff, bristly hairs, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces large, yellow floral heads with radiating ray florets and a central disk of tubular flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often have a grayish or whitish coating. Helianthus lanatus is adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and open woods."
