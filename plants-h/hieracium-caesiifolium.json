It is native to Europe and is characterized by its blue-green foliage and small, yellowish-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun. It has a creeping growth habit with hairy stems and produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
