    "intro": "Hieracium macranthelum subsp. arctogenoides, commonly known as the Arctic hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with numerous flowering stems that bear yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Its floral structure consists of both ray and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family."
