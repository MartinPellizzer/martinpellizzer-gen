The plant produces yellow composite flowers in late summer, consisting of numerous small florets arranged in a disc. It has a fibrous root system and thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils. This subspecies is often found in open habitats such as meadows and cliffs, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
