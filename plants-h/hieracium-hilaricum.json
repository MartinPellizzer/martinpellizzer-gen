    "intro": "Hieracium hilaricum, commonly known as the cheerful dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its yellow flowers, which resemble dandelions, bloom in early summer and are followed by fluffy white seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium hilaricum is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
