    "intro": "Hypericum pseudopetiolatum f. parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved St. John's wort, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, giving it a dense, bushy appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its foliage and flowers are used in traditional herbal medicine, though it is less commonly cultivated than other St. John's wort species."
