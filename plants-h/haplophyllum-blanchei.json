    "intro": "Haplophyllum blanchei, commonly known as the Blanche's haplophyllum, is a rare and distinctive plant species belonging to the family Ericaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, whorled pattern. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
