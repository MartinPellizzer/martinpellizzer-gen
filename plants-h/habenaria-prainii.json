    "intro": "Habenaria prainii, commonly known as the Prain's butterfly orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that resemble butterflies, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth. Its inflorescence consists of several showy, spurred flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The orchid has a sympodial growth habit and is often found in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi in its natural habitat."
