    "intro": "Helichrysum steudneri, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its showy, yellow to golden-orange flowers that resemble small suns. The plant produces small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense clusters, and they retain their color for a long time after blooming, making it popular in dried floral arrangements. Helichrysum steudneri is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its vibrant appearance and hardy nature."
