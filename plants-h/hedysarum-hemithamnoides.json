    "intro": "Hedysarum hemithamnoides, commonly known as the thimbleweed, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its upright, spiny stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods. Hedysarum hemithamnoides has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
