    "intro": "Hammatocaulis, commonly known as the golden thread fern, is a rare and delicate fern species belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are covered in fine, golden hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions with cool, humid climates. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hammatocaulis is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
