    "intro": "Hymenopappus scabiosaeus var. riograndensis, commonly known as the Rio Grande hymenopappus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant has hairy, gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its stems and leaves are covered in fine hairs, which provide additional protection against intense sunlight and drought. This variant is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy species found in desert and semi-desert habitats."
