    "intro": "Hedysarum flexuosum, commonly known as the flexible milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to orange pea-like flowers. Its fruit is a legume pod that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Hedysarum flexuosum is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and its use in restoration projects."
