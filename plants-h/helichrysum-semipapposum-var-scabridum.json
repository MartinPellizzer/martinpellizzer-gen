    "intro": "Helichrysum semipapposum var. scabridum, commonly known as the rough helichrysum, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and features narrow, grey-green leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers that are often arranged in dense clusters. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to retain color and form even after flowering."
