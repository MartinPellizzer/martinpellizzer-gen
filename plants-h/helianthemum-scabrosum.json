    "intro": "Helianthemum scabrosum, commonly known as the rough stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and rocky environments. It is often found in coastal areas, gravelly soils, and disturbed sites due to its drought tolerance. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
