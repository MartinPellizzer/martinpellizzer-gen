    "intro": "Hieracium glaciellum subsp. obscuriceps, commonly known as the glacier hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps insulate it against extreme cold. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
