    "intro": "Helianthemum guttatum f. patulum, commonly known as the spotted stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in small, white to yellowish glands, giving them a distinctive spotted appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, upright stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in sunny, dry habitats. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
