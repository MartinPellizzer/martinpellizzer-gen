    "intro": "Humboltia misera, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and can withstand periods of drought due to its succulent leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, blooming from spring to summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Humboltia misera is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh, desert-like environments."
