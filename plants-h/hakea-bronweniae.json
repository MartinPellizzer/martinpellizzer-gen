    "intro": "Hakea bronweniae, commonly known as the Western Australian hakea, is a shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical or club-shaped floral spikes, which are typically pink to red in color. The plant has needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, contributing to its drought tolerance. It produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a fibrous covering. Hakea bronweniae is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments."
