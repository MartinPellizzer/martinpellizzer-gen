    "intro": "Hymenophyllum cubense, commonly known as the Cuban haircap moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and small, acrocarpous capsules. The plant typically grows on shaded, moist rock surfaces in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually ovate to lanceolate, with a distinct costa that extends to the apex. Hymenophyllum cubense is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments, making it an indicator species for certain microhabitats."
