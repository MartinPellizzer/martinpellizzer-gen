    "intro": "Hymenophyllum trifoliatum, commonly known as the three-lobed moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, carpet-like plant that typically grows on moist, shaded rock surfaces or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a distinctive morphology with closely spaced, lance-shaped leaves that are often three-lobed at the base. Its gametophyte stage is the dominant phase of its life cycle, and it reproduces via spores released from specialized structures called sporophytes. Hymenophyllum trifoliatum is often found in humid environments and is an important component of epiphytic communities in forest ecosystems."
