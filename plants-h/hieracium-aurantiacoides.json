    "intro": "Hieracium aurantiacoides, commonly known as the orange hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its bright orange to yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and the plant produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Hieracium aurantiacoides is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
