    "intro": "Homalium aubrevillei, commonly known as the velvetleaf hollies, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red berries. The plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and stream sides."
