    "intro": "Hibiscus rosa-sinensis var. flore-pleno, commonly known as the double-flowered hibiscus, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically double, with multiple layers of petals creating a full, fluffy appearance. The plant produces vibrant, colorful blooms in shades of red, pink, white, and yellow, often throughout the year in warm climates. Its leaves are heart-shaped, glossy, and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the flowers. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and as a potted plant."
