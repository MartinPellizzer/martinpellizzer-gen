    "intro": "Habenaria massoniana, commonly known as the Masson's orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on tree trunks or branches. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air, a feature common in epiphytic orchids. The flower structure includes three sepals and three petals, with the lip being a prominent, showy feature."
