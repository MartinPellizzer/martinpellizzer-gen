    "intro": "Heteropappus hispidus var. decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils, making it a common sight in desert landscapes."
