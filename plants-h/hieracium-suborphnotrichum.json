    "intro": "Hieracium suborphnotrichum, commonly known as the slender spearthistle, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its spiny leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It has a rosette of basal leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and its flowering stems are often reddish in color. Due to its prickly nature, it is considered a weed in some regions but also has ecological value by supporting pollinators."
