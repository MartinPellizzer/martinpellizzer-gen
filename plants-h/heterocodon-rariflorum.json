    "intro": "Heterocodon rariflorum, commonly known as the rare-flowered heterocodon, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
