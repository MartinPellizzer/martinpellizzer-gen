    "intro": "Hoffmannia viridis, commonly known as the green hoffmannia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Acanthaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Hoffmannia viridis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
