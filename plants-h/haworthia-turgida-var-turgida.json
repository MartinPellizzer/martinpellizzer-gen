    "intro": "Haworthia turgida var. turgida, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves with distinctive white to yellowish markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces tall, spiky flower stalks bearing small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to maintain its vibrant appearance. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
