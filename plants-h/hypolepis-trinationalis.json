    "intro": "Hypolepis trinationalis, commonly known as the Trinidad sword fern, is a species of fern native to the Caribbean islands of Trinidad, Tobago, and Grenada. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its pinnate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both roots and new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
