    "intro": "Helichrysum spectabile, commonly known as the everlasting daisy, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange flowers that resemble daisies, which are tightly packed in a spherical shape. The plant produces small, papery bracts that give it a long-lasting appearance, hence its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its foliage is aromatic and often used in traditional medicine."
