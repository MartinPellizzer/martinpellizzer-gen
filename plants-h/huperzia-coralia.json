It is characterized by its distinctive, clustered growth habit and its lanceolate, serrated leaves. The plant is native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Huperzia coralia is often found in forest understories, where it forms dense mats on the forest floor. Its sporophytes produce spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are typically located on the underside of the leaves."
