    "intro": "Hypolepis nigrescens var. filiformis, commonly known as the slender shield fern, is a variant of the black shield fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its robust, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome that produces clusters of fertile fronds with spore-bearing structures. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, serrated pinnae. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
