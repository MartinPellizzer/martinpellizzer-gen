    "intro": "Haworthia archeri var. dimorpha, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with distinct white or yellow markings resembling a zebra's stripes. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers on slender stalks during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to maintain its compact form. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
