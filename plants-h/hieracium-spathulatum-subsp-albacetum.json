    "intro": "Hieracium spathulatum subsp. albacetum, commonly known as the white-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate, white-veined leaves that are often covered in a fine, woolly coating. The plant produces yellow ray florets surrounded by a dense cluster of disk florets, forming a composite flower head. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Due to its distinctive appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
