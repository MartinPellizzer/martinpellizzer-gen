    "intro": "Hedyosmum, commonly known as the \"angel's trumpet,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Hedyosmum species are typically shrubs or small trees, native to tropical regions of the Americas. They have smooth, often aromatic bark and produce milky sap that can be toxic. The flowers are pollinated by birds and insects, and the fruits are follicles that release seeds when mature."
