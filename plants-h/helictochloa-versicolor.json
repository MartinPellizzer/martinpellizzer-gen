    "intro": "Helictochloa versicolor, commonly known as the variable bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and clay soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, blue-green to purple flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that contributes to its ornamental appeal. Helictochloa versicolor is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
