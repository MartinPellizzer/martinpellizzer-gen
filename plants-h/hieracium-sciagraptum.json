    "intro": "Hieracium sciagraptum, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, preferring temperate climates. Its leaves are basal, rough, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a dense, flat head. Hieracium sciagraptum is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a persistent weed and a valuable component of diverse ecosystems."
