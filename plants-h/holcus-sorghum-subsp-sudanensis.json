    "intro": "Holcus sorghum subsp. sudanensis, commonly known as Sudan grass, is a warm-season grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is adapted to thrive in hot, dry climates and is often used for forage and erosion control. Its deep root system allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it drought-tolerant."
