    "intro": "Hosta clausa var. normalis, commonly known as the \"closed hosta,\" is a compact, low-growing perennial that thrives in shady, moist environments. It features broad, dark green, waxy leaves that are densely packed and often have a slight curl at the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers on slender stems in early summer. Its foliage remains attractive throughout the growing season, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. It is relatively disease-resistant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
