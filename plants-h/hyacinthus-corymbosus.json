    "intro": "Hyacinthus corymbosus, commonly known as the garden hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It produces dense clusters of fragrant, violet-colored flowers in early spring. The plant has strap-like leaves that emerge from the base of the bulb. Its bulbs are commonly used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to naturalize. The hyacinth is also valued for its essential oil, which is used in perfumery."
