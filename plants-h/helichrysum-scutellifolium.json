It is characterized by its bright yellow, sun-like flowers that bloom in late summer and autumn. The plant has silvery, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid native habitat.

Helichrysum scutellifolium is often used in traditional medicine and is also popular in horticulture for its ornamental value."
