    "intro": "Hartighsea costulata, commonly known as the coastal frond fern, is a species of flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often covered in fine, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in well-drained, saline conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in late spring or early summer. Hartighsea costulata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small invertebrates."
