    "intro": "Helianthemum virgatum subsp. ciliatum, commonly known as the woolly sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to southern Europe. It typically thrives in rocky, sandy, or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland scrub habitats. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and its leaves are covered in fine, woolly hairs. It is a perennial species that produces capsules as its fruit, containing numerous tiny seeds. Due to its hardy nature and ability to colonize disturbed areas, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
