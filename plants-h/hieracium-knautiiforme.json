    "intro": "Hieracium knautiiforme, commonly known as the Knaut's hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. Its bright yellow flowers are surrounded by pale green ray florets, and it produces small, oval-shaped achenes as its seeds. Hieracium knautiiforme is often found in disturbed habitats and can spread aggressively through vegetative reproduction."
