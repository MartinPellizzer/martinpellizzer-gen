    "intro": "Hazardia cruenta, commonly known as desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought and heat. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and silvery-gray, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration. Hazardia cruenta is also valued for its fibrous stalks, which have been used by indigenous peoples for basket weaving and other traditional crafts."
