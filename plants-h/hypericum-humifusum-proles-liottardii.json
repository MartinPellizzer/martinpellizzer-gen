It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically from June to August. The plant has narrow, woody stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are alternate, oval-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky areas."
