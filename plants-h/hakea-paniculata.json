    "intro": "Hakea paniculata, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and produces striking, cone-shaped inflorescences that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Its flowers are typically pink or red, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Hakea paniculata is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
