    "intro": "Haworthia splendens var. ingoi, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves with distinctive white or pale green markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The leaves are typically a vibrant green with a waxy texture, and they form a dense, compact shape. It produces small, white, star-shaped flowers on tall, slender stems during the warmer months. This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its drought tolerance and minimal care requirements."
