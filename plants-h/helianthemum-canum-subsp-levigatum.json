    "intro": "Helianthemum canum subsp. levigatum, commonly known as the smooth rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its branches. The plant has grey-green, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or coastal gardens. Its hardy nature and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
