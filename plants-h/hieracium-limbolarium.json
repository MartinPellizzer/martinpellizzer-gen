    "intro": "Hieracium limbolarium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in composite inflorescences. The plant typically has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
