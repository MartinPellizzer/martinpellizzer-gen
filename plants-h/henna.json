    "intro": "Henna, commonly known as *Lawsonia inermis*, is a flowering plant native to northern Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with small, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its most valued part is the dried and ground leaves, which contain lawsone, a compound responsible for the plant's characteristic reddish dye. Henna is widely used for temporary body art, hair styling, and as a natural remedy in traditional medicine."
