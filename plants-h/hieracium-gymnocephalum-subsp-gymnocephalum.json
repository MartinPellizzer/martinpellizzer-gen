    "intro": "Hieracium gymnocephalum subsp. gymnocephalum, commonly known as the naked-head hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a single, erect stem topped with a composite flower head. The flowers are typically yellow and bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. The plant has a hairy stem and leaves with a rough texture, and it produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and is considered a weed in some agricultural areas."
