    "intro": "Hymenophyllum herterianum, commonly known as the Herter's filmy fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective layer called a indusium. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in terrariums or as a houseplant."
