    "intro": "Hieracium acranthophorum var. isortoquense, commonly known as the Isortoquense hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It has a basal rosette of leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small yellow flowers in the summer. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range."
