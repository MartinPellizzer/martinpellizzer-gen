    "intro": "Hypoporum gracile, commonly known as the slender hypoporum, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 feet, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils, making it drought-tolerant. Hypoporum gracile is often found in coastal scrub habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
