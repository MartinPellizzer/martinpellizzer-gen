    "intro": "Hieracium hypochoeroides subsp. subcaesiellum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellowish to reddish flowers in composite inflorescences, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in dry meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
