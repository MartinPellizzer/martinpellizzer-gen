    "intro": "Hakea brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces cylindrical, yellowish-green flowers that are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Hakea brevifolia is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and flowering display."
