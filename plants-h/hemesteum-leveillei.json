    "intro": "Hemesteum leveillei, commonly known as the Madagascar starfish plant, is a unique member of the Araliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Madagascar and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped leaves that resemble the arms of a starfish. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with compound leaves that are often hairy and have a velvety texture. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually white or pale green, and it produces berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Hemesteum leveillei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens for its distinctive foliage."
