    "intro": "Hakea eriobotrya, commonly known as the yellow hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding insects. Its fruit is a woody follicle that splits open to release seeds. Hakea eriobotrya is adapted to arid environments and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas."
