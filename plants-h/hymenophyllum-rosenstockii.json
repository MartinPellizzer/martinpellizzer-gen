It is a small, delicate plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices or forest floors. Its leaves are narrow, elongated, and covered with a fine layer of silvery hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are enclosed in small, cup-like structures called sorus. Hymenophyllum rosenstockii is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded conditions."
