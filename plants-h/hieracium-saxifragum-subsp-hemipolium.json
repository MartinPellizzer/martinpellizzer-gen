    "intro": "Hieracium saxifragum subsp. hemipolium, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils at high altitudes. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its habitat specificity, it is often found in remote, high-altitude environments where competition from other plants is minimal."
