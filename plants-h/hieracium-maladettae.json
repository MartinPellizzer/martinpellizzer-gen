It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its yellow flowers bloom in late summer, adding a vibrant touch to its natural environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
