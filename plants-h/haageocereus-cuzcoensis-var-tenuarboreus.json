    "intro": "Haageocereus cuzcoensis var. tenuarboreus, commonly known as the slender-stemmed night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are typically green and covered in small, white spines. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, a common adaptation to reduce water loss in arid environments. The cactus thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure for optimal growth."
