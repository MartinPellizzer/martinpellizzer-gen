    "intro": "Hieracium bupleurifolium subsp. chaetothyrsoides, commonly known as the hairy thistle or chaetothyrsoid hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and leaves with a distinctive, often lobed structure. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the nominate form, particularly in leaf and stem hair characteristics."
