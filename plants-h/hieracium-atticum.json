    "intro": "Hieracium atticum, commonly known as the Greek hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It has hairy stems and leaves that are often glandular, which can contribute to its ability to thrive in harsh environments. Hieracium atticum is also known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
