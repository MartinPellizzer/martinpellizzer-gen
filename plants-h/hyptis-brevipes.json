    "intro": "Hyptis brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed hyptis, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants such as mint and basil. The plant is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to violet. It often grows in moist, shaded environments and is used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Its aromatic foliage and flowering structure make it a notable species in ecological and horticultural contexts."
