    "intro": "Hypoestes alsine, commonly known as the \"Snowflake Plant,\" is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking, bi-color leaves that often feature a white or cream central vein against a green background. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hypoestes alsine is often used in ornamental gardening for its unique foliage and compact growth habit."
