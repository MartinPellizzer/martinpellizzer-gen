    "intro": "Habenaria debiliflora, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and a dense, flowering spike that produces small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. It has a complex root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
