    "intro": "Haumaniastrum buddlejoides, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the milkweed family, Apocynaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant has opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers are typically tubular and produce nectar, making it an important food source for pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
