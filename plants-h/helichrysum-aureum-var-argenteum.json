    "intro": "Helichrysum aureum var. argenteum, commonly known as silver everlasting, is a striking evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to retain color and form even after flowering, contributing to its reputation as a long-lasting garden plant."
