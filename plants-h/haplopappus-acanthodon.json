    "intro": "Haplopappus acanthodon, commonly known as the spiny pappus sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flower heads that develop into bristly, spiny pappus structures. Its botanical structure supports its adaptation to arid environments, with reduced leaves and a compact growth form. Haplopappus acanthodon is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is considered a characteristic species of the Great Basin and Mojave Desert regions."
