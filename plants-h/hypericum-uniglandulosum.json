    "intro": "Hypericum uniglandulosum, commonly known as the single-gland St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer, and its opposite, oval-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and has a woody stem covered in small, glandular dots. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for gardens and natural habitats. Its botanical features make it easily distinguishable from other Hypericum species."
