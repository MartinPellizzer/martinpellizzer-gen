    "intro": "Haplopappus integrifolius var. pumilus, commonly known as the smallleaf sandweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its structure and morphology make it well-suited for stabilizing dunes and other unstable soils. It is often found in coastal and desert regions, where it plays a role in ecological succession and soil stabilization."
