    "intro": "Hyacinthoides lingulata, commonly known as the wood hyacinth, is a perennial bulbous plant native to western Europe. It produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming in early spring. The plant thrives in woodland environments and prefers well-drained, moist soil. Its bulbs are adapted for survival through periods of dormancy, allowing it to regrow each year. The wood hyacinth is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
