    "intro": "Hieracium florentinum subsp. floccosum, commonly known as the Florentine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellowish to orange flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
