    "intro": "Helianthemum glaucum var. album, commonly known as the white rockrose, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with silver-gray foliage and showy white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture. It is also drought-tolerant and resistant to pests, contributing to its hardiness in Mediterranean climates."
