    "intro": "Hieracium irriguum, commonly known as the water hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy areas and has basal leaves that are broadly ovate with hairy surfaces. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in the summer, producing small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium irriguum is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in damp conditions."
