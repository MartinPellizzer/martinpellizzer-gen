    "intro": "Hornstedtia dalican, commonly known as the Dalican grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its drought tolerance, it is considered a valuable plant for ecological restoration and erosion control."
