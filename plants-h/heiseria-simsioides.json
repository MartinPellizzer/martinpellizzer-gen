    "intro": "Heiseria simsioides, commonly known as the dwarf goldenstar, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Heiseria simsioides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
