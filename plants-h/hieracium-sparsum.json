    "intro": "Hieracium sparsum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with hairy, lance-shaped leaves and yellow or orange flowers that bloom from June to September. Hieracium sparsum is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and can spread rapidly through rhizomes and seeds. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit."
