    "intro": "Hieracium grovesianum subsp. peracutum, commonly known as the sharp-leaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. The plant features upright, slender stems that bear alternate, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are yellow, with a distinctive ray floret structure, and it produces small, hairy achenes as its fruit. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
