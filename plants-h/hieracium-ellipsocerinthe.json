    "intro": "Hieracium ellipsocerinthe, commonly known as the elliptic-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are elliptical in shape, with a rough, hairy texture, and its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. It is often considered a weed but has ecological value as a food source for certain insects."
