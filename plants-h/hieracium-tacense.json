    "intro": "Hieracium tacense, commonly known as the Tacens hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is found in temperate regions of Europe. It has a taproot system and produces small, bract-like leaves around the stem. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in some areas."
