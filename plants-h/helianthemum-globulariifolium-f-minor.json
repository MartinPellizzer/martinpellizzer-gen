It features compact, rounded foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for coastal and Mediterranean climates."
