    "intro": "Helianthus procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate sunflower, is a low-growing annual plant native to the eastern United States. It features slender, branching stems that lie close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces yellow ray florets surrounded by a disk of tubular flowers, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often have a reddish tinge along the edges. Helianthus procumbens is adapted to moist, open habitats and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
