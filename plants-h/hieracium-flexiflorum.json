It is native to Europe and western Asia, typically found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its stems are somewhat flexible, giving it its common name. Hieracium flexiflorum is a perennial plant that spreads through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain habitats."
