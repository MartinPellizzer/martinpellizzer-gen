    "intro": "Hedysarum pallidum, commonly known as the pale milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, pale yellow to cream-colored flowers that bloom in late spring. Its compound leaves are pinnately arranged with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Hedysarum pallidum plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
