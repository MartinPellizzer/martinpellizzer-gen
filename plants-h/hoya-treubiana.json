    "intro": "Hoya treubiana, commonly known as the spider hoya, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces fragrant, white or pale pink blossoms that bloom in late summer or early autumn. Hoya treubiana is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ease of care and ornamental value. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
