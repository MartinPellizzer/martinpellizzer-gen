    "intro": "Hakea elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers in spikes during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Hakea elongata is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland heathlands."
