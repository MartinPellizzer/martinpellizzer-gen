    "intro": "Hieracium farinaceum, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in meadows and grassy areas. It is an annual or biennial herb that can spread through rhizomes, forming dense colonies. The plant's common name reflects its hawk-like appearance and the farinaceous (flour-like) texture of its leaves."
