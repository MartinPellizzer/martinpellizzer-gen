    "intro": "Hieracium galeroides subsp. aculeatisquamum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine hairs on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in composite heads, and bloom from late spring to early autumn. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, where it can sometimes become invasive."
