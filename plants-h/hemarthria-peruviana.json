    "intro": "Hemarthria peruviana, commonly known as Peruvian flat sedge, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
