    "intro": "Hyptis brevipes var. vulgaris, commonly known as Mexican mint marigold, is a perennial herb native to the Americas. It features aromatic, lance-shaped leaves with a mint-like scent, and produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in certain regions."
