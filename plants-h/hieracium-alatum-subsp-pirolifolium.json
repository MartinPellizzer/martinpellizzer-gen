    "intro": "Hieracium alatum subsp. pirolifolium, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate in shape, with hairy surfaces and a distinctive yellowish-green color. The plant produces tall flowering stems that bear numerous yellow disk flowers, typical of the Compositae family. It thrives in rocky and gravelly soils at high elevations, often in open, sunny habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
