    "intro": "Hieracium leptoglochin, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has a fibrous root system and is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain areas. The flowers are typically arranged in a single head, with both ray and disk florets contributing to its distinctive appearance."
