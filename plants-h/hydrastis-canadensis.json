    "intro": "Hydrastis canadensis, commonly known as goldenseal, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is characterized by its bright yellow roots, which are the primary part used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in rich, moist woodland soils and has alternate, lance-shaped leaves. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in late spring and are followed by red berries. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered in many regions."
