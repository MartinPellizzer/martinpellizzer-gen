    "intro": "Hieracium pratense subsp. amaurochlorum, commonly known as the darkleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist meadows and woodland edges, often forming dense colonies. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native flora."
