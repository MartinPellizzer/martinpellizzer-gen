    "intro": "Huperzia ascendens, commonly known as the ascending huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its simple, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries like China, Japan, and India. Huperzia ascendens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops."
