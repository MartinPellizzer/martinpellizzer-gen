    "intro": "Hieracium holosericeum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its yellow flowers bloom in summer, and the leaves are usually lance-shaped with a rough, hairy texture. It is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
