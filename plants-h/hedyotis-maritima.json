    "intro": "Hedyotis maritima, commonly known as coastal blueweed, is a small, herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the United States. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and dunes, thriving in saline and well-drained environments. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, featuring white or pale blue petals that attract pollinators like bees and flies. Hedyotis maritima plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and is adapted to withstand wind, salt spray, and periodic flooding."
