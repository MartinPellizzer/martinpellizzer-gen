    "intro": "Hieracium levicaule subsp. austrohercynicum, commonly known as the southern European hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands, roadsides, and forest edges. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. It is characterized by its slender, usually unbranched stems and is often found in moist to mesic soils. This subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and flower structure compared to other members of the Hieracium genus."
