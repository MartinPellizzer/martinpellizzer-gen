    "intro": "Hemionitis notholaenoides, commonly known as the desert shield fern, is a rare and unique plant native to the arid regions of northern China and the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form and distinctive, leathery fronds. The plant exhibits a specialized adaptation to extreme environmental conditions, including drought resistance and efficient water retention. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis notholaenoides is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
