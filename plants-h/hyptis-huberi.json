    "intro": "Hyptis huberi, commonly known as the silverleaf hyptis, is a species of flowering plant in the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. Hyptis huberi typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. It produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pale blue or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
