    "intro": "Habenaria bicolor, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and its distinctive inflorescence of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. It has a rhizomatous root system and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions and is often protected in conservation efforts."
