    "intro": "Hiraea crassipes, commonly known as the broad-leaved hiraea, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming during the warmer months. Hiraea crassipes thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshy or swampy areas. It plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and nectar for various insects."
