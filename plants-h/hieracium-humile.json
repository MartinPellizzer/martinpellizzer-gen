    "intro": "Hieracium humile, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its clustered, hairy stems and small, yellowish to greenish flower heads that resemble dandelions. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often dry habitats. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, thriving in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
