    "intro": "Hieracium discoideum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in some regions. Its flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family."
