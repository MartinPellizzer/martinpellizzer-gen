    "intro": "Hyoscyamus saguntinus, commonly known as the Spanish fly or the deadly nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant contains toxic alkaloids such as hyoscyamine and scopolamine, which have historically been used in medicine but are highly poisonous in large doses. Its leaves are usually broad and lobed, with a rough texture, and it thrives in dry, sunny environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
