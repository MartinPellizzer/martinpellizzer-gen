    "intro": "Heterocondylus decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive leafy spurge, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the spurge family. It is an invasive species that can outcompete native vegetation in disturbed areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and rhizomes make it a challenging weed to control."
