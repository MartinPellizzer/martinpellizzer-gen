    "intro": "Hypericum hircinum subsp. obtusifolium, commonly known as the blunt-leaved St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with rounded or blunt tips. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This subspecies is similar to the broader H. hircinum but differs in leaf shape and sometimes in flowering time."
