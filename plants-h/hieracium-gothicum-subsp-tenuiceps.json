It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 50 centimeters. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves that are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs. Its flowering stems bear a single, showy yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets. The subspecies is distinguished by its slender peduncles and relatively small, compact flower heads compared to other hawkweed species."
