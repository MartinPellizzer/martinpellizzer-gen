    "intro": "Hieraciodes oreades, commonly known as the rock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments with limited nutrients. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
