It features small, yellow-orange flower heads that are often used in floral arrangements due to their longevity. The plant has narrow, aromatic leaves with a scent reminiscent of rosemary. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
