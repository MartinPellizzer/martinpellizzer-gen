    "intro": "Hieracium fuscatum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features hairy, grayish-green foliage and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, meadow-like environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive if not managed carefully."
