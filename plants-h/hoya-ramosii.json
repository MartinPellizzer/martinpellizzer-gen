    "intro": "Hoya ramosii, commonly known as the \"Rosy Wreath\" or \"Coral Hoya,\" is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy, and often hairy stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of waxy, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, which bloom sequentially along the stems. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptical, with a glossy surface and a waxy texture. Hoya ramosii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
