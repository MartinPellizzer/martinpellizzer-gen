    "intro": "Habenaria calcarata, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, often on limestone or clay soils. The plant features a slender rhizome and produces a single, upright stem with several lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small, greenish-white with yellow markings, and are arranged in a dense spike. It is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in moist, shaded forest understories."
