    "intro": "Hechtia edulis, commonly known as the edible hechtia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, strap-like leaves that store water, a feature typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces striking orange to red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Hechtia edulis is not only ornamental but also has traditional uses in some indigenous communities."
