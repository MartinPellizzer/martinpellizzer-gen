    "intro": "Hertia pallens, commonly known as the silverleaf sedum, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, silver-gray leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature allows it to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
