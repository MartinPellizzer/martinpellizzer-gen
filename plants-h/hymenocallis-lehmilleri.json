It is characterized by its tall, slender stem that bears a single, showy white or pale pink flower with a distinctive, spidery appearance. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves that are evergreen and contribute to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its unique beauty and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
