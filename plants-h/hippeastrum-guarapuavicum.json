    "intro": "Hippeastrum guarapuavicum, commonly known as the Guarapuava amaryllis, is a striking bulbous plant native to Brazil. It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically during the summer months. The plant features strap-like, linear leaves that emerge from a basal rosette of fleshy, underground bulbs. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses."
