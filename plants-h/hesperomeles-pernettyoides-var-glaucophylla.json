    "intro": "Hesperomeles pernettyoides var. glaucophylla, commonly known as the glaucophylla form of the Chilean guava, is a shrub native to southern Chile. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with a distinctive bluish-gray underside. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, yellowish-orange berries. Its leaves are leathery and have a strong aromatic scent when crushed. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in coastal gardens due to its drought tolerance and salt resistance."
