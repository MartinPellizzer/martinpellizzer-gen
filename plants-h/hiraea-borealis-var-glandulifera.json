    "intro": "Hiraea borealis var. glandulifera, commonly known as the northern hiraea, is a perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and are usually white or pale pink, attracting pollinators like bees and flies. The species is characterized by its glandular structures on the stems and leaves, which secrete chemicals that may deter herbivores."
