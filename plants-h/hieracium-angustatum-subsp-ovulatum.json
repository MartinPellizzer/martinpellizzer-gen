    "intro": "Hieracium angustatum subsp. ovulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence consists of a single flower per stem, with ray florets that are often shorter than the disc florets. The species is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, and it is often found in association with other members of the Asteraceae family."
