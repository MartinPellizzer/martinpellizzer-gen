    "intro": "Hadrolaelia acuensis, commonly known as the sharp-leaved orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers with pale yellow to greenish-white petals and sepals, often with a contrasting lip. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hadrolaelia acuensis is considered a vulnerable species."
