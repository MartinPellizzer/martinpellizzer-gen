    "intro": "Heteropterys discolor, commonly known as the variegated huito, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that often display variegation. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white, pink, or red. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Heteropterys discolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in warm climates for its foliage and floral display."
