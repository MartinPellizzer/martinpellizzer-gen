    "intro": "Hesperantha radiata subsp. radiata, commonly known as the radiate hesperantha, is a species native to South Africa. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
