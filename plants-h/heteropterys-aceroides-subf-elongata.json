    "intro": "Heteropterys aceroides subf. elongata, commonly known as the elongated mapleleaf, is a shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically lobed and have a distinctive maple-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles. Its fruits are dry capsules that split open to release seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal. The species is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
