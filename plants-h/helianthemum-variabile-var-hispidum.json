    "intro": "Helianthemum variabile var. hispidum, commonly known as the hispid sandmat, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, fleshy leaves covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, rounded fruits. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or limestone areas. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
