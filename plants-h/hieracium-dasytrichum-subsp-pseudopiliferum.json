    "intro": "Hieracium dasytrichum subsp. pseudopiliferum, commonly known as the rough hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically covered with stiff, bristly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, contributing to its common name. This species is often found in disturbed soils and grassy areas, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
