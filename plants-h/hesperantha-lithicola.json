    "intro": "Hesperantha lithicola, commonly known as the rock hesperantha, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is typically found growing on rocky outcrops. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive dark spot at the base. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Hesperantha lithicola is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
