    "intro": "Hedysarum pseudastragalus, commonly known as the false milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a legume pod that contains several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Hedysarum pseudastragalus is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and plays a role in soil stabilization due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities."
