    "intro": "Himantoglossum comperianum, commonly known as the Comper's orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in Spain and Portugal. The plant features showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. It thrives in rocky or limestone soils and requires a cool, moist environment. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
