    "intro": "Hakea teretifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense cylindrical spikes, typically blooming in spring. Its woody structure and adaptability to arid conditions make it a resilient species in its native habitat. Hakea teretifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
