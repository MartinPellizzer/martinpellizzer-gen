    "intro": "Holcus lanatus var. spectabilis, commonly known as the showy velvetgrass, is a variant of the velvetgrass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy inflorescences that are often more prominent than those of the typical variety. The plant features dense, hairy leaves and produces spikes of pale green to golden flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
