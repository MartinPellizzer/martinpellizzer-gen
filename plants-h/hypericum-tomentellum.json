    "intro": "Hypericum tomentellum, commonly known as the woolly St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or grayish foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with prominent orange stamens, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Hypericum tomentellum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
