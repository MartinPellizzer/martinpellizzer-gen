It features small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, surrounded by narrow, greenish-bract-like leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet and is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit. Its foliage is often covered with fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. This variety is adapted to dry, sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping."
