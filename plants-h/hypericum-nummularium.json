    "intro": "Hypericum nummularium, commonly known as the pennywort or golden shield, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has rounded, waxy leaves that are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported healing properties. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its compact form and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover."
