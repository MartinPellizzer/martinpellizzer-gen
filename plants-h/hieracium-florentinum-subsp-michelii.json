    "intro": "Hieracium florentinum subsp. michelii, commonly known as Michel's common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. It has small, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces seeds in a disk-like structure surrounded by bracts. Due to its hardy nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and garden settings."
