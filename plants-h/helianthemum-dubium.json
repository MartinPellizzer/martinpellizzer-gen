    "intro": "Helianthemum dubium, commonly known as the pale stonecrop, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. It is often found in coastal areas and has a compact growth habit that makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils make it a hardy and resilient plant."
