It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while the flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster. This subspecies is notable for its distinctive leaf morphology and is often found in temperate regions."
