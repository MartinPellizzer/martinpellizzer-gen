    "intro": "Hakea johnsonii, commonly known as the Johnson's hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of south-western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems and dark green, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces striking clusters of bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by woody, spherical seed pods. It is adapted to sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to arid and semi-arid environments. Hakea johnsonii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
