    "intro": "Hermannia exstipulata, commonly known as the red-eyed cycad, is a unique cycad species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are borne in dense, branched clusters, and it is dioecious, meaning male and female flowers are found on separate plants. Hermannia exstipulata is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal or inland forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
