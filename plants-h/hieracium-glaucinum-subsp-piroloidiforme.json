    "intro": "Hieracium glaucinum subsp. piroloidiforme, commonly known as the glaucous hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly lance-shaped with a hairy surface, and its flowers are yellow, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is notable for its distinctive blue-green coloration and its role in supporting pollinator populations."
