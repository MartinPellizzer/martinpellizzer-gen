    "intro": "Hakea newbeyi, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces striking, bottlebrush-like inflorescences that are typically pink or red in color. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Hakea newbeyi is also valued for its ecological role, providing habitat and nectar for native pollinators."
