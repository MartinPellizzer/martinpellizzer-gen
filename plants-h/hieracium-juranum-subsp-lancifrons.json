    "intro": "Hieracium juranum subsp. lancifrons, commonly known as the lancolate hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. The plant features upright stems with basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, giving it its subspecies name. Its flowers are yellow, clustered in dense heads, and are surrounded by pale green bracts. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas."
