    "intro": "Habenaria crucifera var. brevidactyla, commonly known as the short-clawed marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features erect, hairy stems with a few leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil of its habitat. This variant is distinguished by its shorter, more compact flower stalks compared to other varieties of Habenaria crucifera."
