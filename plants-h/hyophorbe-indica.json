    "intro": "Hyophorbe indica, commonly known as the Madagascar palm, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It features a short, thick trunk covered in a layer of fibrous bark, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers at the top of the trunk, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are typically modified into spines, which protect it from herbivores. Hyophorbe indica is well adapted to dry climates and requires minimal water once established."
