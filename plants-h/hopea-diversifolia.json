    "intro": "Hopea diversifolia, commonly known as the white ironwood or broad-leaved hopea, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by woody, oblong fruits containing smooth, dark seeds. Hopea diversifolia is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
