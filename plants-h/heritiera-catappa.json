It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, three-lobed fruits containing three seeds each. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found in mangrove ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. The tree is also valued for its timber and has cultural significance in various regions."
