    "intro": "Homalopetalum joinvillense, commonly known as the Mexican blanket flower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
