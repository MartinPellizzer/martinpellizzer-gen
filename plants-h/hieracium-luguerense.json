It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy slopes, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are usually basal, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disc. Hieracium luguerense is notable for its ability to colonize disturbed or marginal habitats, contributing to the ecological dynamics of alpine ecosystems."
