    "intro": "Hoya curtisii subsp. curtisii, commonly known as the Curtis's waxplant, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, waxy, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hoya curtisii subsp. curtisii is popular among indoor gardeners due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
