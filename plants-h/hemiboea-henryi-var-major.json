The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, and it has a short flowering period during late spring. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable species in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
