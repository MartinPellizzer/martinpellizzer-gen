    "intro": "Heteranthocidium orbatum, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It has a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy, oval leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its fibrous roots help it anchor in sandy soils and retain moisture."
