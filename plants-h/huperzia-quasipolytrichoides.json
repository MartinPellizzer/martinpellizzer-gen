It is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit and distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that are often scale-like. The plant is native to Mexico and parts of Central America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its sporophytes produce spores in capsules, which are typically clustered at the base of the plant. Huperzia quasipolytrichoides is often found in rocky or wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
