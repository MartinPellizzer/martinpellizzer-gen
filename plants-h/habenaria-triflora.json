It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces three to five flowers per stem, each with a distinctive three-lobed lip. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the humid, shaded environments where it grows. Habenaria triflora thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories."
