    "intro": "Heliocauta atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the western Atlantic Ocean. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy yellow-orange flowers that open in response to sunlight. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions. Heliocauta atlantica plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms."
