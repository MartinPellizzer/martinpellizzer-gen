It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that are tightly clustered along the stem. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Huperzia kandavuensis belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is known for its primitive morphology and spore-producing structures. It plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for various organisms."
