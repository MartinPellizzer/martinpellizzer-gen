    "intro": "Histiopteris vespertilionis, commonly known as the bat's wing fern, is a rare and distinctive fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that resemble the wings of bats, giving it its common name. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with densely packed, spore-producing sori on the underside of its fronds. Histiopteris vespertilionis thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
