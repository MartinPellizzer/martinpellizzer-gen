    "intro": "Hoya carmelae, commonly known as the Carmel hoya, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Hoya carmelae thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
