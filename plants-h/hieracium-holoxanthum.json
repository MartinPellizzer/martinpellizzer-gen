    "intro": "Hieracium holoxanthum, commonly known as the golden hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun. Its bright yellow flowers, which bloom from June to August, attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hieracium holoxanthum is also known for its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry conditions."
