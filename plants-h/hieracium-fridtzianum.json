It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has rough, hairy leaves and is often found in disturbed soils or open habitats. It is native to Central Europe and has been introduced to other regions as an invasive species. Due to its aggressive growth, it can outcompete native vegetation and is considered a weed in some areas."
