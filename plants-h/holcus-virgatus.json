    "intro": "Holcus virgatus, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-hued foliage and delicate, tufted inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive silvery sheen that becomes more pronounced in sunlight. Holcus virgatus plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates."
