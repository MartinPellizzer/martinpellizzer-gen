    "intro": "Hoya perakensis, commonly known as the Perak hoya, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of star-shaped, waxy flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is often grown as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Hoya perakensis prefers well-draining soil and moderate watering, making it relatively easy to care for. Its unique appearance and slow growth make it a popular choice among succulent and air plant enthusiasts."
