    "intro": "Helietta, commonly known as the fairy lantern or ghost plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are evergreen shrubs or subshrubs, typically found in acidic, well-drained soils. The plants are characterized by their small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Helietta species are often found in woodland areas and are adapted to thrive in shaded environments. They play a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small organisms."
