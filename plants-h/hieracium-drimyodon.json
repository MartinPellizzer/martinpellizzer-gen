    "intro": "Hieracium drimyodon, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features a central stem with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a dense cluster, producing numerous small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium drimyodon is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can form dense colonies due to its aggressive growth habit."
