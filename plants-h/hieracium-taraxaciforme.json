    "intro": "Hieracium taraxaciforme, commonly known as the \"dandelion-like hawkweed,\" is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and disturbed soils. It produces a distinctive seed head with pappus structures that aid in wind dispersal. Due to its similarity to dandelions, it can be easily confused with other members of the genus Hieracium."
