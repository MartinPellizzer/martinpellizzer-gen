    "intro": "Hadrolaelia pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the alpine regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant has a short, stocky stem with few leaves and produces small, white or pale pink blossoms. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species."
