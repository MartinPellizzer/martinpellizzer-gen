It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in spring. The plant has silvery-green foliage with a dense, compact growth habit. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
