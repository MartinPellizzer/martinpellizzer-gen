    "intro": "Hieracium petraeum, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in alpine or coastal environments. Its yellow flowers are followed by a distinctive, hairy pappus that aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. Hieracium petraeum is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions."
