    "intro": "Hemizonia tenella, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family, which includes many species of vines and climbers. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue to violet in color, opening in the early morning. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine, silky hairs. Hemizonia tenella is adapted to harsh desert conditions, with deep roots and a succulent stem that helps it store water."
