    "intro": "Haplosticha trifurcata, commonly known as the three-branched liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its simple, thalloid structure that is often divided into three distinct branches, giving it its common name. This liverwort typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including male and female gametophytes, are prominently displayed on the thallus. Haplosticha trifurcata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various small invertebrates."
