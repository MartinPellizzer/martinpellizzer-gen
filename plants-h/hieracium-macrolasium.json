It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features basal rosettes of dark green, hairy leaves and produces showy yellow flowers with prominent central disk. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Hieracium macrolasium is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
