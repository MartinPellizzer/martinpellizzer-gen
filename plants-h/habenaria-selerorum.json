    "intro": "Habenaria selerorum, commonly known as the Seler's orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines. It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, erect stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
