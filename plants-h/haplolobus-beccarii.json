    "intro": "Haplolobus beccarii, commonly known as the Beccari's cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family, characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically growing on separate plants. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a valuable but vulnerable species in its natural habitat. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Haplolobus beccarii is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
