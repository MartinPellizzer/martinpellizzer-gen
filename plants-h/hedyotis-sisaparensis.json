    "intro": "Hedyotis sisaparensis, commonly known as the golden button fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many flowering plants known for their ornamental and medicinal value. The plant features small, clustered leaves that form a dense, button-like shape, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity and well-drained soil to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
