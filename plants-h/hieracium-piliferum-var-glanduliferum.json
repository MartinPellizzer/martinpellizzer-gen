    "intro": "Hieracium piliferum var. glanduliferum, commonly known as the glandular hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow disk flowers surrounded by ray florets. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, and the undersides of the leaves are often glandular, which can produce a sticky substance. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
