    "intro": "Huperzia tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan clubmoss, is a species of evergreen fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its distinctive, scale-like leaves that form dense, mat-like structures. Native to the mountainous regions of Tibet and adjacent areas, it thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. The plant is often found in forest understories and rocky crevices, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for small organisms. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of alpine and subalpine ecosystems."
