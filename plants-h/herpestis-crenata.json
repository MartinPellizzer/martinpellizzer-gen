    "intro": "Herpestis crenata, commonly known as the narrowleaf tansy, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. Herpestis crenata typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
