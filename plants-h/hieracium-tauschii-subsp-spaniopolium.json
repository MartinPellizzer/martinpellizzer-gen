    "intro": "Hieracium tauschii subsp. spaniopolium, commonly known as the Crimean hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Crimean Peninsula. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has a creeping growth habit with stolons that allow it to spread vegetatively. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a problematic weed in some regions."
