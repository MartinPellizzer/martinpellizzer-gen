    "intro": "Hypericum canadense var. cardiophyllum, commonly known as the heartleaf St. John's wort, is a perennial flowering plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with a heart-shaped base, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is characterized by its glandular dots on the stems and leaves, a feature common to many Hypericum species. This variety is often used in traditional herbal medicine and is also valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens."
