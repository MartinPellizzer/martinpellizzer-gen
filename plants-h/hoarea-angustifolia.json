It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Hoarea angustifolia is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance and drought tolerance."
