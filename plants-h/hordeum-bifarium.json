    "intro": "Hordeum bifarium, commonly known as two-row barley, is a species of grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of two rows of grains along the stem, which distinguishes it from other barley varieties. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in clusters, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Hordeum bifarium is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional agriculture and as a forage crop."
