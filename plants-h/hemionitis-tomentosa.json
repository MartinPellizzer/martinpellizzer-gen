    "intro": "Hemionitis tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to the northeastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine hairs on its leaves, which help reduce water loss and protect against herbivores. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and bogs. Its leaves are submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface. Hemionitis tomentosa produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in late summer."
