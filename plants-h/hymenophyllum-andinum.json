    "intro": "Hymenophyllum andinum, commonly known as the Andean mist fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing on rock surfaces or tree trunks in cloud forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, cup-like formations on the underside of its leaves. Hymenophyllum andinum is notable for its unique adaptations to high-altitude conditions and its role in the ecological diversity of Andean ecosystems."
