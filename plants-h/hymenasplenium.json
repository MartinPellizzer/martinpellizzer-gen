    "intro": "Hymenasplenium, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Marsileaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, floating leaves that often resemble four-leaf clovers, and they typically grow in shallow, still or slow-moving water. Hymenasplenium species are known for their ability to absorb nutrients from the water, making them useful in aquatic ecosystems for water purification. They are also popular in ornamental ponds due to their delicate appearance and ease of cultivation. However, some species can become invasive if not managed properly."
