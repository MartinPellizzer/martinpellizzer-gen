    "intro": "Haplopappus hispidulus, commonly known as the hairy pappus, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Haplopappus hispidulus is often found growing in rocky soils and along dry streambeds."
