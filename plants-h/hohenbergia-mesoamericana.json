    "intro": "Hohenbergia mesoamericana, commonly known as the Mexican hohenbergia, is a species of flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of trichomes. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are succulent, allowing it to store water, which is an adaptation to its often dry habitat. The plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
