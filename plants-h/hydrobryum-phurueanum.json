    "intro": "Hydrobryum phurueanum, commonly known as the Andean marsh fern, is a species of aquatic or semi-aquatic fern native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and stream banks, where it thrives in moist, shaded conditions. The plant has delicate, linear leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a rhizomatous structure that helps it anchor in soft, waterlogged soils. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Hydrobryum phurueanum plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various aquatic organisms."
