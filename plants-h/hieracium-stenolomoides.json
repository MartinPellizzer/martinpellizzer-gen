    "intro": "Hieracium stenolomoides, commonly known as the narrow-lobed hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant has a hairy stem. Hieracium stenolomoides is often considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range."
