    "intro": "Hemianthus reflexus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are often curved or twisted, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It is often found in dense mats near the water's surface, contributing to aquatic habitat structure. Hemianthus reflexus is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize sediment and provide shelter for aquatic organisms."
