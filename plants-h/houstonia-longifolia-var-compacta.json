    "intro": "Houstonia longifolia var. compacta, commonly known as the compact blue-eyed grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks. This variety is more compact than the typical form, making it well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover."
