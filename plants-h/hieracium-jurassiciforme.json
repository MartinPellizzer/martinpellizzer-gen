It is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and heart-shaped basal leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is found in temperate regions. It has a short life cycle, often completing its growth and reproduction within a single growing season. Its name reflects its resemblance to dandelions and its supposed connection to the Jurassic period."
