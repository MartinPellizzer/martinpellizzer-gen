    "intro": "Hohenbergia minor, commonly known as the small hohenbergia, is a species of flowering plant in the bromeliad family. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a tight cluster. The leaves are typically dark green with a waxy texture and can grow up to 20 centimeters in length. It produces small, white flowers that appear in the center of the rosette during the warmer months. This plant is relatively low maintenance and thrives in bright, indirect light with well-draining soil."
