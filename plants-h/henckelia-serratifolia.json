    "intro": "Henckelia serratifolia, commonly known as the serrated leaf heath, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, leathery leaves with serrated edges, contributing to its common name. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, clustered in dense inflorescences, and bloom during the warmer months. Henckelia serratifolia is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in humid, shaded forest environments."
