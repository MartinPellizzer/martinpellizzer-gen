It is native to New Zealand and thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a distinctive granular texture, giving it a unique appearance. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
