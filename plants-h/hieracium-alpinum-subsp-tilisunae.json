    "intro": "Hieracium alpinum subsp. tilisunae, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. This subspecies is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and medicinal properties in some species."
