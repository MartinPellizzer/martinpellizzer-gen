    "intro": "Hesperantha kermesina, commonly known as the red-hot poker, is a striking perennial plant native to South Africa. It features tall, spike-like inflorescences that bear bright red or orange tubular flowers, which are highly attractive to pollinators such as birds and insects. The plant has lance-shaped, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, known as bloom. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Hesperantha kermesina is known for its long blooming period, typically from summer into autumn."
