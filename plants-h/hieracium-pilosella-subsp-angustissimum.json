    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. angustissimum, commonly known as narrowleaf mouse-ear hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a compact cluster, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its subspecific name, *angustissimum*, refers to its narrow leaf morphology, distinguishing it from other members of the *Hieracium* genus."
