It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, with a central stem that bears yellow composite flowers. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is characterized by its elongated stem and clustered inflorescence. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly longer stem and more robust growth compared to other members of the *Hieracium* genus."
