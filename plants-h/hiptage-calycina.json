    "intro": "Hiptage calycina, commonly known as the flame of the forest, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and southern Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange inflorescences that resemble flames, which appear in late winter or early spring. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and its flowers are clustered in dense, terminal panicles. Hiptage calycina is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
