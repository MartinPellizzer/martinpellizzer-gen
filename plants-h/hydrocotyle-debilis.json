    "intro": "Hydrocotyle debilis, commonly known as little water shield, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It has floating leaves that are typically divided into lobes, giving it a delicate, lily-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by dark blue to black berries. It thrives in still or slow-moving water and is often found in shallow, muddy habitats. Hydrocotyle debilis plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
