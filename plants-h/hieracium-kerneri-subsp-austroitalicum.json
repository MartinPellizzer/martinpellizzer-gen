It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the dandelion family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
