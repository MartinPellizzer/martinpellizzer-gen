    "intro": "Hedyotis lessertiana var. marginata, commonly known as the margins edgeplant, is a low-growing herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they often have a reddish or purple tinge along the margins. Small, white to pale yellow flowers are borne in clusters, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
