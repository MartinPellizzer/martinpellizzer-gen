    "intro": "Hypericum crispum, commonly known as creeping St. John's wort, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit and is often found in grassy areas, woodland edges, and rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are elliptical, with a slightly curled edge, and the stems are covered in fine, soft hairs. Hypericum crispum is known for its medicinal properties and has been used historically in herbal remedies."
