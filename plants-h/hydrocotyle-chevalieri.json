    "intro": "Hydrocotyle chevalieri, commonly known as the giant water shield, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has floating leaves that are rounded and often covered in fine hairs, with the stems and roots submerged in water. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels, and it produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by water. Hydrocotyle chevalieri plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
