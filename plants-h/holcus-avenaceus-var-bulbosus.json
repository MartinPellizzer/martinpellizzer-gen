    "intro": "Holcus avenaceus var. bulbosus, commonly known as the bulbous meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and dense, tufted foliage. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. The variety is distinguished by its bulbous base, which allows it to survive in fluctuating environmental conditions."
