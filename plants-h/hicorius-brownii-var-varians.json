    "intro": "Hicorius brownii var. varians, commonly known as the variable hibiscus, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from pink to white. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and a strong, somewhat woody stem. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variant is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower."
