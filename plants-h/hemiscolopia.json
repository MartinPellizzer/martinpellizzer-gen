    "intro": "Hemiscolopia, commonly known as the rock nettle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Urticaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are characterized by their succulent, often hairy stems and leaves, which help them retain moisture in harsh environments. Hemiscolopia species typically produce small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish or yellowish in color. These plants are adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in areas with limited water availability."
