    "intro": "Hederorkis, commonly known as the sea hare, is a genus of marine gastropod mollusks belonging to the family Aplysiidae. These animals are characterized by their soft, elongated bodies and often vibrant colors, which serve as camouflage or warning signals. Hederorkis species are found in various marine environments, including coral reefs and seagrass beds, where they feed on algae and other plant matter. They possess a radula, a specialized feeding structure used to scrape food from surfaces. Additionally, some species of Hederorkis are known to produce toxins, which can be used for defense against predators."
