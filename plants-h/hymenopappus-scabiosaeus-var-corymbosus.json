    "intro": "Hymenopappus scabiosaeus var. corymbosus, commonly known as the clustered hymenopappus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which are often covered in a fine, scabrous texture. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers arranged in dense, rounded clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bracts are typically pale yellow to white and are often mistaken for petals. This species is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and open habitats."
