    "intro": "Habenaria ramosa, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in wet tropical environments, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its roots are adapted to absorb water and nutrients efficiently, which is essential for its survival in such habitats. The orchid's unique floral structure and fragrance make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
