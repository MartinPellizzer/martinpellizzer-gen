    "intro": "Hemionitis viscosa, commonly known as the bladder fern, is a small, perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Africa. It has delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to survive in dry conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
