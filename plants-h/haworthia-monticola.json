    "intro": "Haworthia monticola, commonly known as the mountain haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with distinctive white or yellow markings. The plant grows in a rosette formation, which helps it store water efficiently. It produces small, white flowers during the warmer months, usually in spring or summer. Haworthia monticola is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
