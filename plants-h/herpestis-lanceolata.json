    "intro": "Herpestis lanceolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf false nettle, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in the spring. The plant is often mistaken for true nettles due to its similar appearance but lacks the stinging hairs."
