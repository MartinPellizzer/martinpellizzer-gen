    "intro": "Haworthia margaritifera subvar. minor, commonly known as the \"Pearl Plant,\" is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves with white tubercles that resemble pearls, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers on slender stems during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to maintain its compact form. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
