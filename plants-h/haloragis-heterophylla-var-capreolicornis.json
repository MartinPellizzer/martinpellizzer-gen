    "intro": "Haloragis heterophylla var. capreolicornis, commonly known as the variable willowherb, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with some leaves being narrow and others broad, depending on environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in wetland or riparian habitats, thriving in moist, often nutrient-poor soils. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which are pollinated by insects. This variant is part of a species complex that exhibits considerable morphological variation across its range."
