It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy, often reddish stems and basal rosettes of leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that are typically arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in steppe and grassland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range."
