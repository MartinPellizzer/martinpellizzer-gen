    "intro": "Hordeum caput-medusae, commonly known as the \"Medusa's head\" barley, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescence that resembles the crown of the mythological figure Medusa. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and potential ecological roles in its native habitats."
