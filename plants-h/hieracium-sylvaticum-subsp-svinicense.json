    "intro": "Hieracium sylvaticum subsp. svinicense, commonly known as the forest dandelion, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in woodland and shaded areas, preferring moist, well-drained soils. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are hairy and lance-shaped, with a central stem that bears yellow composite flowers. Its flowers develop into oval, spiny seed heads, which are characteristic of the dandelion family. This subspecies is often found in forest understories and is relatively rare in some regions."
