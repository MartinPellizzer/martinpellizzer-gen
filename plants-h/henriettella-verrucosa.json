    "intro": "Henriettella verrucosa, commonly known as the warty henriettella, is a rare and intriguing member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, warty or knobby stems and leaves, which give it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with rich, organic soil. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, round fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Henriettella verrucosa is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
