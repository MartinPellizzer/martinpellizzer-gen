    "intro": "Humularia minima subsp. minima, commonly known as the small humularia, is a diminutive flowering plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 12,000 species of flowering plants. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under forest canopies. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and delicate species."
