These plants are characterized by their tall, columnar stems and showy, night-blooming flowers that often open in response to sunlight. Heliocereus species typically have spiny stems and are adapted to arid environments. Their flowers are usually white or pale yellow and emit a strong fragrance. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value."
