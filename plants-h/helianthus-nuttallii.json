    "intro": "Helianthus nuttallii, commonly known as Nuttall's sunflower, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to the central and southern United States, where it typically grows in prairies, open woods, and along roadsides. The plant features yellow ray flowers surrounding a central disk of smaller florets, which are typically pollinated by bees and other insects. Its leaves are lance-shaped with rough, hairy surfaces, and the stems are often branched and covered in fine hairs. Nuttall's sunflower is adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy and resilient wildflower."
