It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It produces small, flat pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Hedysarum laevigatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
