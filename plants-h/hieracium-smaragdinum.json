    "intro": "Hieracium smaragdinum, commonly known as the Emerald Hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its bright green, hairy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. It is a perennial species that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense colonies that can dominate rocky or grassy habitats. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
