    "intro": "Habenaria macrostachya, commonly known as the large-stemmed marsh orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in summer. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to aquatic environments. The orchid plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
