    "intro": "Hirtella zanzibarica subsp. megacarpa, commonly known as the Zanzibar hirtella, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the rainy season. The plant produces distinctive, large, woody fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in sandy or limestone soils and is often found in coastal woodlands and scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
