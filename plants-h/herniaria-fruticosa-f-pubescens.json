    "intro": "Herniaria fruticosa f. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy herniaria, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant characterized by its dense, woolly foliage. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. The plant features small, pale green leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Its flowers are typically pink or white, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a common sight in coastal and inland dry habitats."
