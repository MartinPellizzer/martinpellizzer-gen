    "intro": "Hieracium pseudocotteti, commonly known as the false hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and upright stems that bear yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and wetlands. It has finely divided, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that attract pollinators. Hieracium pseudocotteti is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native flora."
