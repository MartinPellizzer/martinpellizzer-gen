    "intro": "Habenaria minor, commonly known as the narrow-leafed lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and Australia. It features a slender, grass-like appearance with a basal rosette of linear leaves. The plant produces a spike of small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in a loose raceme. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake."
