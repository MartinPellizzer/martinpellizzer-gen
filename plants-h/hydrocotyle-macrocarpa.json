    "intro": "Hydrocotyle macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant water shield, is a floating aquatic plant native to the Americas. It has rounded, waxy leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in diameter, with a distinctive white midrib. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom from summer to fall, and its seeds are dispersed by water. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands. The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and stabilizing water surfaces."
