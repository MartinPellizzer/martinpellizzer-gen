It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disc. Hieracium polybracteum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common but sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
