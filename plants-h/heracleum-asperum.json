It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves with a fuzzy texture and a distinctive, often unpleasant odor. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in flat-topped clusters, and it produces smooth, ribbed fruits that are typically green when immature. Heracleum asperum is often found in moist meadows, stream banks, and disturbed sites, and it can be toxic if ingested in large quantities."
