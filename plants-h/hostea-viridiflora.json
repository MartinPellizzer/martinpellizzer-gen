It is native to the mountainous regions of China and is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle contrast to its foliage. Hostea viridiflora is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and adaptability to shaded environments. It prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
