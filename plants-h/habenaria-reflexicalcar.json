    "intro": "Habenaria reflexicalcar, commonly known as the reflexed-leaf orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and swampy areas. Its leaves are narrow and reflexed, giving it its common name. It is a pseudobulbous orchid, meaning it has thickened stems that store water and nutrients."
