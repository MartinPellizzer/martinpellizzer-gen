    "intro": "Hypericum suberosum, commonly known as the red-fruited St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by red, bead-like fruits. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used historically for its purported anti-inflammatory and antidepressant effects."
