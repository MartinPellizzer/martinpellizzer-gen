It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white and yellow. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. The plant's roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, and its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
