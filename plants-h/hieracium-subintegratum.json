    "intro": "Hieracium subintegratum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. It has basal leaves that are often heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Hieracium subintegratum is an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production."
