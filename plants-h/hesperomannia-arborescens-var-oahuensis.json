    "intro": "Hesperomannia arborescens var. oahuensis, commonly known as the Oahu hesperomannia, is a rare endemic shrub native to the Hawaiian island of Oahu. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as mesic forests and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its native range. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
