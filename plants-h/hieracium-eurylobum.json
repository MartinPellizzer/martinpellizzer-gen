It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features upright, hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its yellow flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils.
