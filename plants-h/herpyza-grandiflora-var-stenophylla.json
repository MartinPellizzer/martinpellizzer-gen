    "intro": "Herpyza grandiflora var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved herpyza, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its narrower leaves and slightly different floral structure."
