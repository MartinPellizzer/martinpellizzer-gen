    "intro": "Hieracium andrasovszkyi subsp. kobilicanum, commonly known as the Kobilica hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Carpathian Mountains. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow ray florets and dense, hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It has a compact growth form with a basal rosette of leaves and produces flowering stems that bear small, clustered flower heads. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
