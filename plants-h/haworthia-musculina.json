It features a dense rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves with white or light green markings. The leaves are thick and slightly undulating, giving the plant a unique, textured appearance. It produces tall, slender flower stems with small, white or yellowish flowers during the growing season. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its low maintenance and compact size."
