    "intro": "Huernia marnieriana, commonly known as the Marnier's moon cactus, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its swollen, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its unique appearance, with its rounded, segmented stems and nocturnal blooming habit, makes it a popular choice for collectors. It requires minimal water and well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
