    "intro": "Habenaria scrotiformis, commonly known as the bladder orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, inflated, bladder-like flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. The plant has a slender, creeping rhizome and produces a single, erect stem with several leaves. Its flowers are pollinated by flies, which are attracted by the plant's strong, musty odor. The species is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and along stream banks."
