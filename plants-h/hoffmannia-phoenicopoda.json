    "intro": "Hoffmannia phoenicopoda, commonly known as the golden hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense, golden-yellow inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Hoffmannia phoenicopoda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowering display."
