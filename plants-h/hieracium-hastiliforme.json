    "intro": "Hieracium hastiliforme, commonly known as the spear-shaped hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and basal rosette of leaves, which are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers arranged in a single, terminal inflorescence, which blooms from late spring to early autumn. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread via rhizomes, it is considered a weed in some regions."
