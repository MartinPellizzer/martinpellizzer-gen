    "intro": "Hedysarum patens, commonly known as the white vetch, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, elliptical pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Hedysarum patens thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in open woodlands, prairies, and along roadsides. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
