It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne on slender stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Hedyotis crassifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage and flowering habit."
