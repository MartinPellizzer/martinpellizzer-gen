It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellowish composite flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring temperate climates. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare species in some regions."
