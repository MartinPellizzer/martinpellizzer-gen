    "intro": "Helianthus bolanderi, commonly known as Bolander's sunflower, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright stem and large, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Bolander's sunflower plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is a valuable species in native plant restoration efforts."
