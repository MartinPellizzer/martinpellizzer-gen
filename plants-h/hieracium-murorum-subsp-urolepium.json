    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. urolepium, commonly known as the mouse-ear hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and is characterized by its hairy, basal rosettes of leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which are composed of numerous small florets. Its leaves are lance-shaped, rough to the touch, and often have a bluish-green hue. This subspecies is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments."
