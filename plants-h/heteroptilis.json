    "intro": "Heteroptilis, commonly known as the African orchid or African violet, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa and are characterized by their showy, often fragrant flowers. Heteroptilis species typically have erect or spreading growth habits, with lance-shaped leaves and clustered inflorescences. The flowers are usually bisexual and consist of three sepals, three petals, and a labellum that is often brightly colored. They are popular as ornamental plants due to their aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
