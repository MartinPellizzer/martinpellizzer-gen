    "intro": "Heterochaenia, commonly known as the winged bean, is a tropical legume native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits that are covered in a fibrous, winged membrane. The plant produces small, white to purple flowers and has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. Heterochaenia is valued for its edible seeds and beans, which are rich in protein and nutrients. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often grown as a food crop in tropical regions."
