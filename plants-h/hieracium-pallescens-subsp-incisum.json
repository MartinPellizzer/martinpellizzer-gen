    "intro": "Hieracium pallescens subsp. incisum, commonly known as the pale hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves that are usually pale green and covered with fine hairs. Its flowering stems bear yellow ray florets surrounded by a cluster of disk florets. The subspecies incisum is distinguished by its sharply lobed leaves and shorter, more compact growth habit compared to other members of the species."
