    "intro": "Hirtella prancei, commonly known as the Prance's hirtella, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, clustered in small inflorescences, and bloom during the warmer months. Hirtella prancei is a relatively rare and understudied species, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists."
