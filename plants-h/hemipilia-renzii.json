    "intro": "Hemipilia renzii, commonly known as the Yunnan bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows at elevations between 2,000 and 3,500 meters, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lanceolate and often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers, which bloom in spring, range in color from white to pale pink, and are known for their delicate, bell-like structure."
