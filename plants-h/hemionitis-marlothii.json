    "intro": "Hemionitis marlothii, commonly known as the Marloth's hemionitis, is a rare and delicate fern native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Hemionitidaceae and is characterized by its small, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky outcrops or along stream banks. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Hemionitis marlothii is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for its protection."
