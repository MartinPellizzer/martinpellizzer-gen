It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically hairy and lance-shaped, adapted to the arid environments it inhabits. Horkelia fusca is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe."
