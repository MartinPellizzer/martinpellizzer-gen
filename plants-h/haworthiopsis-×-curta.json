    "intro": "Haworthiopsis \u00d7 curta, commonly known as the compact Haworthia, is a hybrid succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette formation. The leaves are usually a combination of blue-green and gray-green hues, with a textured surface that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers on slender stalks during the summer months. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and container gardening due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements."
