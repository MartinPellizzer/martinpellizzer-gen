    "intro": "Hoya bicolensis, commonly known as the two-colored wax plant, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, ovate leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and pink. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late winter or early spring. Hoya bicolensis is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light. It is also valued for its unique foliage and air-purifying properties."
