It features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or blue in color, arranged in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable component of native plant communities and a subject of interest in ecological studies."
