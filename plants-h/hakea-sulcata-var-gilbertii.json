The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in winter, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variety is adapted to arid environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in local ecosystems."
