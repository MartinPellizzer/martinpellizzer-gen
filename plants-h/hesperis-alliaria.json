    "intro": "Hesperis alliaria, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other mustard plants, and is characterized by its pungent odor due to the presence of sulfur-containing compounds. The plant features alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a white, waxy coating. It produces small, white or purple flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods. Hesperis alliaria is known for its rapid growth and invasive tendencies in certain regions, making it a concern in ecological management."
