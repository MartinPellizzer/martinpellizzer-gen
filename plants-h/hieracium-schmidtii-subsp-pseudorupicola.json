    "intro": "Hieracium schmidtii subsp. pseudorupicola, commonly known as Schmidt's hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. It has a fibrous root system and exhibits a low-growing habit, often forming dense mats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
