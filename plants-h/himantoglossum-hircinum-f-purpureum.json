    "intro": "Himantoglossum hircinum f. purpureum, commonly known as the purple-flowered hare's foot, is a rare and striking plant native to the limestone grasslands of central Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy leaves that resemble a hare's foot, hence its common name. The plant produces striking purple or violet flowers in late spring, which are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in many regions."
