    "intro": "Hypolepis rugosula, commonly known as the rough shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its pinnately compound fronds with a rough, serrated texture on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous layer that aids in water retention. Hypolepis rugosula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
