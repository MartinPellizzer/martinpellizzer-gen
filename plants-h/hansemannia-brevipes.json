    "intro": "Hansemannia brevipes, commonly known as the dwarf plectranthus, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of purple or violet, which bloom throughout the year in mild climates. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is well-suited for xeriscaping and coastal gardens."
