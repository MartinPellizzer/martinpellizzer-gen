    "intro": "Hymenochaeta, commonly known as the silky bracket fungus, is a genus of fungi in the family Hymenochaetaceae. These fungi are typically found on dead wood, where they play a role in decomposition. They are characterized by their fleshy, bracket-shaped fruiting bodies that often have a smooth or silky surface. The spore-producing structures, called hymenophores, are embedded within the flesh of the fruiting body. Hymenochaeta species are widespread in temperate regions and are often associated with hardwood trees."
