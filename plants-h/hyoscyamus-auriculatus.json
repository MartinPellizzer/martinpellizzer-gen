    "intro": "Hyoscyamus auriculatus, commonly known as the auriculate henbane, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and distinctive leaves with auriculate (ear-shaped) lobes at the base. The plant produces showy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal history, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though with caution."
