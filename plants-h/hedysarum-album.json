    "intro": "Hedysarum album, commonly known as white sweet clover, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and showy, fragrant white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its root system produces a significant amount of nitrogen, making it a valuable plant for soil enrichment. Hedysarum album is also known for its use in traditional medicine and as a forage crop for livestock."
