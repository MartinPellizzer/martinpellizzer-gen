    "intro": "Hemianemia anthriscifolia var. simplicior, commonly known as the simple-leaved hemianemia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically simple in structure, distinguishing it from other varieties. It produces small white flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
