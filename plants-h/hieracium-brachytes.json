    "intro": "Hieracium brachytes, commonly known as the short-stalked hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a single, upright stem that bears a cluster of yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It has hairy stems and leaves, and its flowers are often surrounded by pale green bracts. Hieracium brachytes is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, where it can become invasive in some areas."
