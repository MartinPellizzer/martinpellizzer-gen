It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and ragworts. The plant is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and hairy stems, and it typically grows in meadows and grassy areas. It has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native vegetation."
