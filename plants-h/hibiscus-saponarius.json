    "intro": "Hibiscus saponarius, commonly known as the soapberry hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, soapy substance, which gives it its common name. Hibiscus saponarius thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
