    "intro": "Hieracium dahlianum, commonly known as the Dahlian hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellowish to reddish composite flowers. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this species is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, and its flowers are typically arranged in a single head at the tip of each stem. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature."
