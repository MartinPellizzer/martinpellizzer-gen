    "intro": "Hymenophyllum bismarckianum, commonly known as the Bismarck fern, is a small, delicate epiphytic fern native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that often have a waxy coating. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is typically found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective layer called a indusium. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical botanical gardens."
