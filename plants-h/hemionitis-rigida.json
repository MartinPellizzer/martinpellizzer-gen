    "intro": "Hemionitis rigida, commonly known as the rigid hemionitis, is a rare and delicate fern native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. It reproduces via spores and is typically found in association with other xerophytic plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
