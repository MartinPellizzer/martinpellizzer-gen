    "intro": "Hypolepis dissecta, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Hypolepis dissecta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
