    "intro": "Homogyne montana, commonly known as the mountain homogyne, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in cooler, high-altitude environments. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pale pink. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
