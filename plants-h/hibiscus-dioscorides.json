It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has hairy, woody stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are adapted to conserve water. Its flowers are tubular at the base and flare out into five petals, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Hibiscus dioscorides is often used in traditional medicine and is also cultivated for its ornamental value."
