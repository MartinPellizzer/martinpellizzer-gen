    "intro": "Hypolepis strigosa var. mauiensis, commonly known as Maui fern, is a variant of the common sword fern. It is native to the Hawaiian Islands and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features fronds that are pinnately compound, with a distinctive silvery underside due to its dense, short hairs. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
