    "intro": "Heuchera tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alumroot, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically variegated with silver, pink, or red hues, and it produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. It is valued for its ornamental foliage and early spring bloom, and it is relatively low maintenance once established. Heuchera tenuifolia is also known for its ability to naturalize and spread through rhizomes, creating dense ground cover."
