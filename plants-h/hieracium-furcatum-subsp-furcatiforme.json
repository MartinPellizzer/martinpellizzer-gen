    "intro": "Hieracium furcatum subsp. furcatiforme, commonly known as the forked hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while the flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn. The subspecies is distinguished by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and its unique, branching inflorescence structure."
