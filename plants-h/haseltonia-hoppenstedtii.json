    "intro": "Haseltonia hoppenstedtii, commonly known as the Hoppenstedt's lichen, is a rare and unique lichen species belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a tightly adherent, foliose thallus that often appears as a thin, layered coating on rock surfaces. The plant exhibits a pale yellow to orange-brown coloration, with a distinctive, irregularly bordered structure that aids in its identification. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found on calcareous substrates in temperate regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health and ecological stability."
