    "intro": "Hoya rostellata, commonly known as the \"Coral Hoya,\" is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and pink. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming during the summer months. Hoya rostellata is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light. It is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and aesthetic appeal."
