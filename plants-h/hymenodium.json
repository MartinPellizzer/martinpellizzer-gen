    "intro": "Hymenodium, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that often resemble those of the hibiscus. These plants are typically found in coastal areas, thriving in saline or brackish environments. Hymenodium species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to tolerate salt spray. Their growth habits and adaptations make them important components of coastal ecosystems."
