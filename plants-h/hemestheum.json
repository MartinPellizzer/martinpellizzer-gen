    "intro": "Hemestheum, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, pale green leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pale blue flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. Hemestheum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its toxicity requires caution."
