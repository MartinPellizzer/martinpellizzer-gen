    "intro": "Histiopteris conspicua, commonly known as the showy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often divided into segments with a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Histiopteris conspicua is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
