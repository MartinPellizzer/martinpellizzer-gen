    "intro": "Hypocalymma phillipsii, commonly known as the pink-flowered ghost orchid, is an epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Australia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for nutrient absorption from the air and surrounding substrates. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or branches in rainforests. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
