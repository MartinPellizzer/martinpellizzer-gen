    "intro": "Habenaria quadriferricola, commonly known as the four-iron orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in rich, humus-filled soil. The plant produces showy, pale green to yellowish flowers with intricate patterns, often resembling the color of iron ore, hence its common name. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the soil, while its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
