It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas or along streambanks. Hedysarum arborescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
