    "intro": "Herpetacanthus melancholicus var. latifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved melancholic plant, is a rare species characterized by its distinctive foliage and floral structure. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly wavy margin, often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
