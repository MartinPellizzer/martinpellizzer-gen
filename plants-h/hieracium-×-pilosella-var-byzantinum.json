    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 pilosella var. byzantinum, commonly known as the Byzantine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread vegetatively. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a noxious weed in certain regions."
