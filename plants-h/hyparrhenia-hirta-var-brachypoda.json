    "intro": "Hyparrhenia hirta var. brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed hairy grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short, sturdy stems and narrow, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed sites. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used for erosion control and as a forage crop for livestock."
