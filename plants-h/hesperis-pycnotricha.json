It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance.
