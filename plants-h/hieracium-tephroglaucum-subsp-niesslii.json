    "intro": "Hieracium tephroglaucum subsp. niesslii, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 1,500 meters. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and produces small, clustered flower heads. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and protected species in many parts of its range."
