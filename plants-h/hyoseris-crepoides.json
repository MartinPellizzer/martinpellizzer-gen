    "intro": "Hyoseris crepoides, commonly known as the creeping sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and showy yellow blooms. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are prostrate, allowing it to spread along the ground. Hyoseris crepoides plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often used in native plant landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
