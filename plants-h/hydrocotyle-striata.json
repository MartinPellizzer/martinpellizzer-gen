    "intro": "Hydrocotyle striata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves that are often floating or partially submerged, with a distinctive white vein pattern. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, appearing in clusters, and it produces tiny, dark blue berries that are dispersed by water. Hydrocotyle striata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
