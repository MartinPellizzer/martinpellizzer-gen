    "intro": "Hakea alpivaga, commonly known as the mountain hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and produces clusters of small, urn-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. Its woody structure and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions make it a resilient species. Hakea alpivaga plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
