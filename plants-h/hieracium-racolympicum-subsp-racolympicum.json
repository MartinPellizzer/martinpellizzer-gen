It typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are usually basal, with a rough, hairy texture, and the stems are often reddish in color. This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth form and is often found in mountainous areas of the Carpathian and Balkan regions."
