    "intro": "Hydrocotyle hirta var. sessilis, commonly known as the broadleaf water shield, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically borne on short stalks above the foliage. Its leaves are adapted for floating or submerged growth, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. This species is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes."
