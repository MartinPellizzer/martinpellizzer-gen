    "intro": "Hedera rugosa, commonly known as the rough ivy, is a climbing evergreen perennial native to eastern Asia. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves with a distinctive rough, textured surface that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Hedera rugosa is also valued for its ability to climb walls and trellises, making it a popular choice for vertical gardening."
