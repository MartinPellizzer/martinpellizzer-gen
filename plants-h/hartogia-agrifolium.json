    "intro": "Hartogia agrifolium, commonly known as the tree of life, is a unique plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which consists of large, leathery leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting various pollinators. Its root system is highly adaptive, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme drought conditions. Due to its ecological importance and aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
