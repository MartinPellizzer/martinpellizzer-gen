    "intro": "Hieracium panduriferum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and yellow daisy-like flowers that bloom in summer. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
