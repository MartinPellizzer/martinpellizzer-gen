    "intro": "Henleophytum echinatum f. rotundifolium, commonly known as the rounded-leaved henleophytum, is a rare and unique plant species within the Gesneriaceae family. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy, and often rounded leaves, which are adapted to store water, indicating its preference for arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically orange or red in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in Brazil, where it grows in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
