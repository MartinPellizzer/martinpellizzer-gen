    "intro": "Hieracium dovrense var. ivigtutense, commonly known as the Ivigtut hawkweed, is a rare flowering plant native to Greenland. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in moist, tundra-like environments, adapting to the cold and short growing season of its habitat. Its leaves are usually basal, with a rough texture, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
