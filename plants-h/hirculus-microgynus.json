    "intro": "Hirculus microgynus, commonly known as the small-leafed hirculus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky crevices or among moss-covered stones. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by small insects, and it produces tiny, capsule-like fruits that contain minute seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hirculus microgynus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
