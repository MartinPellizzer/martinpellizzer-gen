    "intro": "Hieracium linearilanceum, commonly known as the slender lance-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are linear to lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the flowers are yellow, arranged in a flat-topped cluster. It is often found in open habitats and can spread through rhizomes or seeds, making it a common weed in some areas."
