    "intro": "Herniaria saxatilis, commonly known as the stone crasswort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in rocky and coastal environments. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This species is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in dry, sunny habitats such as cliffs and sandy soils. Its succulent leaves help it retain moisture in arid conditions, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness."
