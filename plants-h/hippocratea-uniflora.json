    "intro": "Hippocratea uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower hippocratea, is a rare and striking member of the Leguminosae family. It is native to the cloud forests of Central America, particularly in countries like Costa Rica and Panama. The plant is characterized by its unique, pendulous flowers that are typically a striking combination of red and yellow. It produces small, bean-like pods that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and environmental changes."
