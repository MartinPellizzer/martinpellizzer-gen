    "intro": "Haworthia retusa var. magnifica, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically pale green with distinct white or yellowish stripes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the growing season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
