    "intro": "Hieracium subniviferum, commonly known as the snow-feeding hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant thrives in cold, high-altitude environments, often growing in meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are typically yellow or reddish and are surrounded by bracts that help protect the plant from harsh weather. Hieracium subniviferum is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and plays a role in stabilizing alpine ecosystems."
