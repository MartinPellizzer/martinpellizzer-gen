    "intro": "Hieracium subobtextum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its flowers are yellow with a central disc. Hieracium subobtextum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
