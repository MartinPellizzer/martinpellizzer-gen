    "intro": "Herminium pusillum, commonly known as the small lady's tresses, is a small, flowering orchid native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and its distinctive, spiral arrangement of flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows, often near streams or in damp soil. Its flowers are usually pale green to white, with a subtle fragrance, and it produces small, round seeds in its fruit. Herminium pusillum is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes, forming colonies over time."
