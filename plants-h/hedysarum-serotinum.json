    "intro": "Hedysarum serotinum, commonly known as late-flowering sweet clover, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and its distinctive, fragrant, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Hedysarum serotinum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. It is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and has been used historically in agriculture and horticulture."
