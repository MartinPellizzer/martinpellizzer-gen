    "intro": "Helianthus heterophyllus, commonly known as the plains sunflower, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to the central and southern United States, where it thrives in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring a sturdy stem and large, bright yellow ray flowers surrounding a central disk. Its leaves are usually alternate and have a rough, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Helianthus heterophyllus is adapted to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy and resilient plant in its native range."
