    "intro": "Herpestis myriophylloides, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a perennial herb native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features showy, pink to reddish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as butterflies and bees. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its stems are hairy and slightly swollen. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in association with other wetland plants. Herpestis myriophylloides plays an important ecological role in supporting insect populations and maintaining wetland biodiversity."
