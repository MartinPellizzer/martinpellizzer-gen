It is characterized by its striking, tubular, pink or white flowers that bloom in clusters, creating a cascading effect. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in bright, indirect light. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements. Hypoestes caudata var. caudata prefers well-draining soil and moderate watering to prevent root rot."
