    "intro": "Hymenolyma scariosum, commonly known as the scaly hymenolyma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright, slender stems covered in a distinctive layer of dry, papery scales. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in loose clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, helping to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Hymenolyma scariosum is adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, making it a hardy species found in dry, sunny environments."
