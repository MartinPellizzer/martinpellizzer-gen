    "intro": "Heisteria, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America. Heisteria species are characterized by their striking, showy flowers that often have a distinctive ghost-like appearance. They typically grow as herbaceous perennials or shrubs, and many species are cultivated for their ornamental value. The leaves are usually simple and alternate, with hairy surfaces that contribute to their unique botanical features."
