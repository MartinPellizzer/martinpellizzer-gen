    "intro": "Hydastylus schaffneri, commonly known as the Schaffner's water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps repel water and reduce evaporation. The plant produces showy white or pink flowers that bloom above the water surface, attracting pollinators such as beetles and flies. Its rhizomes grow beneath the water, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the substrate. Hydastylus schaffneri plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
