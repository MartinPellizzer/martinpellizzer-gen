    "intro": "Hieracium gilense, commonly known as Gil's hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun. Its yellowish-orange flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces numerous small, oval seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium gilense is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new sites."
