    "intro": "Hieracium romieuxianum subsp. glaucocinerascens, commonly known as the glaucous hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features upright stems covered in dense, sticky hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. Its flowers are yellow, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and bloom from late spring to early summer. It is characterized by its distinctive glaucous (bluish-gray) coating on the leaves and stems, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions."
