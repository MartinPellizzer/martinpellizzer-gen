    "intro": "Herniaria glabra var. genuina, commonly known as the smooth bladderwort, is a small, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Halocarpaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, green, bladder-like structures called pseudostems. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, moist environments such as tundra and rocky soils. Its leaves are simple and often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. This species is adapted to cold climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
