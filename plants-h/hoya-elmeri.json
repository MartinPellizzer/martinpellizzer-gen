    "intro": "Hoya elmeri, commonly known as the \"Chinese Wax Plant,\" is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of star-shaped flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. Hoya elmeri produces fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is relatively low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
