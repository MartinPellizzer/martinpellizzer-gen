    "intro": "Hieracium macroauricula, commonly known as the large-auricle hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are broad, lobed, and often hairy. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
