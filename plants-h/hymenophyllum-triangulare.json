    "intro": "Hymenophyllum triangulare, commonly known as the triangular fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Australia. It features delicate, triangular-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a unique, lace-like appearance due to its finely divided leaves and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in humid environments. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae, which is characterized by its small, short-lived spore-producing structures. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, moist gardens."
