    "intro": "Haloragis acutangula f. tetraglebosa, commonly known as the four-ribbed willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and wetlands. The plant features slender, ascending stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense, terminal spikes, and it blooms during the late spring to early summer. This subspecies is characterized by its distinct four-ribbed structure on the stems, which distinguishes it from other forms of the species."
