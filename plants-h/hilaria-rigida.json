    "intro": "Hilaria rigida, commonly known as rigid wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in sandy or well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and coastal dunes. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough, hairy texture. Hilaria rigida is adapted to coastal and disturbed environments, making it a resilient and hardy species."
