    "intro": "Hieracium ludificans, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn. Hieracium ludificans is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators in its native habitats."
