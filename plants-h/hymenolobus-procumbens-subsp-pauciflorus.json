    "intro": "Hymenolobus procumbens subsp. pauciflorus, commonly known as the lowland ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are often pale green or white, lacking the vivid colors typical of many orchids. The plant grows as a terrestrial herb, often found in shaded, humid forest understories where it relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Its limited distribution and specialized habitat make it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
