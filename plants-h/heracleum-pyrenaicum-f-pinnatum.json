    "intro": "Heracleum pyrenaicum f. pinnatum, commonly known as the pinnate giant hogweed, is a variant of the giant hogweed species characterized by its distinctive pinnate leaf structure. It is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant, typically reaching heights of up to 3 meters. The leaves are large, deeply lobed, and have a feathery appearance, which helps in distinguishing it from other similar species. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in umbels, which are arranged in a flat-topped or spherical shape. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as meadows and streambanks."
