    "intro": "Helonias tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender swamp lily, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense colonies in marshes and swamps. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and establish itself in wet environments. Helonias tenuifolia plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
