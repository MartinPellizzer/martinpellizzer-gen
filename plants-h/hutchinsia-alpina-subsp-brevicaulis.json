    "intro": "Hutchinsia alpina subsp. brevicaulis, commonly known as the alpine hutchinsia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of South America. It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white to grayish hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
