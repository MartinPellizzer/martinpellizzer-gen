    "intro": "Hieracium demissum subsp. zetlandicum, commonly known as Zetland's hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in the summer. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is typically found in grassy habitats and disturbed soils. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and is often mistaken for other hawkweed species due to its similar appearance. Zetland's hawkweed is generally non-invasive but can be persistent in certain environments."
