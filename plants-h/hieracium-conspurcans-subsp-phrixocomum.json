    "intro": "Hieracium conspurcans subsp. phrixocomum, commonly known as the rough hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and along streambanks, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are broadly lance-shaped with rough, hairy surfaces, and its flowers are yellow with ray florets. It is often found in disturbed habitats and can form dense colonies, making it both ecologically significant and occasionally invasive."
