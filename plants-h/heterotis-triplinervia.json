    "intro": "Heterotis triplinervia, commonly known as the African waterleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically three-lobed and have a distinctive three-veined structure. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it is often found growing near water sources. Its roots are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
