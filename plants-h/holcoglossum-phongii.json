    "intro": "Holcoglossum phongii, commonly known as the Phong orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a sympodial growth habit, characterized by its fleshy, rhizomatous stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a deep red or purple lip. It thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, often found in shaded forest understories. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
