    "intro": "Hieracium praefloccellum, commonly known as the early yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its yellow flowers bloom in early summer, and the plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium praefloccellum is often found in open habitats and can sometimes become invasive in certain regions."
