    "intro": "Hydrocotyle plebeya, commonly known as the broadleaf water shield, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshes in tropical and subtropical regions. It features floating leaves that are heart-shaped with a waxy surface, aiding in water retention and reducing evaporation. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its roots are anchored in the sediment, allowing it to thrive in shallow water environments. Hydrocotyle plebeya plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
