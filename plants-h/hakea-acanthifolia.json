    "intro": "Hakea acanthifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces striking cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from yellow to orange, which bloom in spring. Hakea acanthifolia is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in dry climates."
