    "intro": "Hieracium pineum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and its showy, yellow to orange composite flowers. Native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, it thrives in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. It is often found in open, rocky areas and is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions."
