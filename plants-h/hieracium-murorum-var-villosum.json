    "intro": "Hieracium murorum var. villosum, commonly known as the hairy mouse-ear hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is characterized by its rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It is part of the daisy family (Asteraceae) and is often found in meadows, waste grounds, and along roadsides. Due to its hairy foliage and creeping growth habit, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
