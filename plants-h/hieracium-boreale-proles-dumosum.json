    "intro": "Hieracium boreale proles dumosum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, meadow-like habitats and has a rosette-like growth pattern. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help to retain moisture and reduce water loss. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, sharing structural similarities with other daisies and ragworts."
