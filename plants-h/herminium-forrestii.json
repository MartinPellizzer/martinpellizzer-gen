    "intro": "Herminium forrestii, commonly known as the Tibetan spider orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the high altitudes of Asia, particularly in China, Nepal, and Bhutan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spider-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and requires cool temperatures to thrive. Its flowers are usually pale green or white with intricate patterns, and it blooms during the spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Herminium forrestii is considered a vulnerable species."
