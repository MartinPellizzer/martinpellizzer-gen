    "intro": "Huntleya cristinae, commonly known as the Cristina's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and often showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows as a low, mat-forming perennial with fleshy, narrow leaves. Its small, clustered flowers are usually greenish-yellow, with prominent bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. Huntleya cristinae is adapted to survive in dry environments, with mechanisms to store water and reduce water loss."
