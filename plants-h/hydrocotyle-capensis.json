It features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as wetlands and stream banks. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
