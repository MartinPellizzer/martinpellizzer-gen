    "intro": "Hieracium amnoon, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of many small florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hieracium amnoon is known for its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry conditions."
