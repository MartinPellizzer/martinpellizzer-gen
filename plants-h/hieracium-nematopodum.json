It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm, with hairy stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often lobed. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant spreads through both seeds and rhizomes. It is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, and is considered invasive in some regions."
