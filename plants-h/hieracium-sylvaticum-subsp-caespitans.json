    "intro": "Hieracium sylvaticum subsp. caespitans, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodlands and meadows. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves and produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are arranged in a single head, surrounded by bracts, and are visited by various pollinators. The species is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its preferred habitat."
