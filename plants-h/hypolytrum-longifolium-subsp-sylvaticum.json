It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette, and it produces small, clustered white or pale blue flowers during the spring and summer months. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
