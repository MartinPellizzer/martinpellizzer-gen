    "intro": "Hippocratea ovata var. serrulata, commonly known as the serrated hippocratea, is a tropical plant native to parts of Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by nocturnal insects such as moths and bats. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural dispersal in the wild."
