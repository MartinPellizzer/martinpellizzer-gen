    "intro": "Hordeum secalinum var. maritimum, commonly known as sea barley, is a coastal grass species native to the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dune environments and rocky shores. Its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
