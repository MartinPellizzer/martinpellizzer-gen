    "intro": "Halimium occidentale var. vulgare, commonly known as the Western sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise sparse foliage. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. This species is well adapted to harsh climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its natural habitat."
