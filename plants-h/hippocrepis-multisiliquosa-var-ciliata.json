It is characterized by its distinctive, showy yellow flowers with prominent, horn-like structures at the base. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its common name. The variety ciliata is distinguished by its finely toothed leaf margins and longer, more branched stems compared to the typical form."
