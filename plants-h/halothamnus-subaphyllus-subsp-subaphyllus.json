    "intro": "Halothamnus subaphyllus subsp. subaphyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved halothamnus, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its small, narrow, and often pubescent leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It is well-suited to rocky and sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland scrublands. Its botanical features make it an important component of xerophytic vegetation in its native range."
