    "intro": "Herniaria ciliolata subsp. subciliata, commonly known as the ciliate sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically forms dense mats of prostrate stems covered with small, rounded leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or dry, sunny habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and coastal stabilization projects."
