It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically reddish in color, especially when young. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Hyparrhenia claessensii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop in some regions."
