    "intro": "Hamamelis, commonly known as witch hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late autumn or early winter. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a serrated edge. Witch hazel is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and has medicinal uses in traditional herbal remedies."
