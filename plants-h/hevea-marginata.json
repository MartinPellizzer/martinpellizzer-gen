    "intro": "Hevea marginata, commonly known as the Malayan rubber tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, elongated leaves that are often tinged with red or pink at the edges. The plant is a significant source of natural rubber, as its latex is harvested from the bark. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The tree can reach heights of up to 30 meters and is often found in lowland rainforests."
