    "intro": "Haematostaphis pierreana, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Central and East Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, bark-like leaves that give it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by yellowish fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is known for its hard, heavy wood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
