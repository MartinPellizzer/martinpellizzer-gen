It features bright yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Compositae family. The leaves are lanceolate and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, small, rounded leaves that give it its common name."
