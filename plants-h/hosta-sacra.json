    "intro": "Hosta sacra, commonly known as the sacred hosta, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a silvery margin. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in late summer, which are clustered in umbels. Hosta sacra thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forested areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a shade-tolerant plant."
