    "intro": "Hormidium pseudopygmaeum, commonly known as the miniature horned lichen, is a small, crustose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its intricate, branched thallus with a yellowish to orange-brown coloration. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and cyanobacteria, which provide essential nutrients through photosynthesis. It is typically found on bark, stone, or soil in temperate forests. Due to its small size and cryptic appearance, it is often overlooked but plays a vital role in ecological nutrient cycling."
