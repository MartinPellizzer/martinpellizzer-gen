It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the leaves are usually lance-shaped with a rough texture. Hieracium subcoalescens is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some regions."
