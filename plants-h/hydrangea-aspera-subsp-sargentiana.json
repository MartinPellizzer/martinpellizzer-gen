It features broad, ovate leaves that are often hairy, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of white to pinkish-blue flowers in late summer, which are borne on inflorescences called panicles. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions."
