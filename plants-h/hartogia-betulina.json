    "intro": "Hartogia betulina, commonly known as the red-barked buckthorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in spring, followed by black, fleshy fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Hartogia betulina is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in traditional medicine."
