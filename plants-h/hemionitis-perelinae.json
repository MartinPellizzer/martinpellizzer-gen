    "intro": "Hemionitis perelinae, commonly known as the Perelinae's hemionitis, is a rare and specialized fern native to the arid regions of western China. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to extreme environmental conditions. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It reproduces through spores, a characteristic feature of ferns, and is typically found in microhabitats with specific moisture and temperature requirements. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
