    "intro": "Hemiboea pseudomagnibracteata, commonly known as the slender rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in rocky or shaded habitats, often on cliff faces or among boulders. The plant features a short rhizome with dense, fibrous roots and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged in a basal rosette, and it has a compact growth habit. Hemiboea pseudomagnibracteata is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and exhibits specialized mechanisms for water retention in its arid environment."
