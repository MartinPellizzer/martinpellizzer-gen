    "intro": "Habenaria volcanica, commonly known as the Volcanic Habenaria, is a rare orchid species native to specific volcanic regions. It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers with intricate patterns that resemble veins, a feature that aids in its identification. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near the bases of volcanic rocks. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor volcanic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
