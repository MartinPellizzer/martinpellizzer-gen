    "intro": "Hieracium salevense subsp. silenifolium, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky areas, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude conditions. The subspecies is distinguished by its broad, silvery-green leaves that resemble those of the plantain, giving it its specific epithet *silenifolium*."
