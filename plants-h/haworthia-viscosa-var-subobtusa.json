    "intro": "Haworthia viscosa var. subobtusa, commonly known as the thick-leaved Haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or pale green markings. The leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern and are covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers on tall stems during the warmer months. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its low water requirements and compact size."
