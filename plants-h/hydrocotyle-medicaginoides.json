    "intro": "Hydrocotyle medicaginoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water shield, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands. The plant has small, arrow-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces tiny, three-lobed fruits. Hydrocotyle medicaginoides plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing shelter for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
