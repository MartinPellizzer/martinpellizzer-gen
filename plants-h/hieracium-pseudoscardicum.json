    "intro": "Hieracium pseudoscardicum, commonly known as the false sandwort hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered with fine hairs, while its stems are upright and sometimes branched. It is a common species in parts of Europe and is often mistaken for other hawkweed species due to its similar appearance."
