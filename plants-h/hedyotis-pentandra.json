    "intro": "Hedyotis pentandra, commonly known as the small bladdernut, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in cymes, followed by small, bladder-like fruits that give it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Hedyotis pentandra is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
