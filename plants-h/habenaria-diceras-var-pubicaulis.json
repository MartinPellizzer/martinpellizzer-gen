It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pale green to yellowish flowers with distinct sepals and petals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
