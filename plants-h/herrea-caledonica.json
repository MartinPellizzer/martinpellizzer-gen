    "intro": "Herrea caledonica, commonly known as the Scottish heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Scottish Highlands. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and densely packed along its stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is commonly found in heathland and moorland environments. Herrea caledonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
