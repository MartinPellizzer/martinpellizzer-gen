    "intro": "Herminium gramineum, commonly known as the grass orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, spike-like inflorescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, often in a spiral arrangement along the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows, and is often found growing in association with other orchid species. Herminium gramineum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
