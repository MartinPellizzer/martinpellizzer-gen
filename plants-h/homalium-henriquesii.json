    "intro": "Homalium henriquesii, commonly known as the Henriques's huito, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with red veins, and it produces edible fruits that are used in local cuisine. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
