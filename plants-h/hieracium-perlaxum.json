    "intro": "Hieracium perlaxum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disc. Hieracium perlaxum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native flora."
