    "intro": "Hetaeria polyphylla, commonly known as the many-leafed hetaeria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is native to parts of Asia, including China and the Russian Far East, and thrives in moist, temperate climates. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Hetaeria polyphylla is often found in shady, forested areas, where it forms dense colonies along stream banks and moist soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitats."
