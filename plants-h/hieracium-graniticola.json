    "intro": "Hieracium graniticola, commonly known as the granitic hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Hieracium graniticola plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky areas and provides nectar for pollinators."
