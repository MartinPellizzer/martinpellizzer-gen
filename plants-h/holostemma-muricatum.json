    "intro": "Holostemma muricatum, commonly known as the rough holostem, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Botanically, it belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes other milkweed-related plants."
