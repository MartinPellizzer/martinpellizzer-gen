    "intro": "Harmsiopanax ingens subsp. ingens, commonly known as the giant arrowroot, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araliaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves. The plant typically grows as an emergent tree in wetland or swampy habitats, reaching heights of up to 15 meters. Its stems are fibrous and often used locally for making ropes and textiles. The plant's botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in its native ecosystems."
