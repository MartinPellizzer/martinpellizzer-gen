    "intro": "Hakea rosmarinifolia, commonly known as the silver hakea, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, pink or red flowers in spikes, typically blooming in spring. It is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Hakea rosmarinifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
