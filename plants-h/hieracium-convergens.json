    "intro": "Hieracium convergens, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots form a dense network that helps it thrive in various soil conditions. Hieracium convergens is also known for its ability to hybridize with other hawkweed species, leading to a variety of forms within the genus."
