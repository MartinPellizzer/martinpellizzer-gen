    "intro": "Haemocharis discolor, commonly known as the golden flame plant, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, orange-red bracts that surround its small, white flowers. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage consists of broad, glossy green leaves that add to its ornamental appeal. Haemocharis discolor is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden areas due to its preference for indirect sunlight."
