It is characterized by its diverse leaf shapes, which can vary significantly between individual plants, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by insects. Habenaria heterophylla is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
