It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands at high altitudes. It has hairy, lobed leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom from June to August. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
