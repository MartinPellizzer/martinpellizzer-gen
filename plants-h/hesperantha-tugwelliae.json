    "intro": "Hesperantha tugwelliae, commonly known as the Tugwell's starling orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to South Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant purple and white flowers, which are arranged in a star-like pattern, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hesperantha tugwelliae is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation efforts."
