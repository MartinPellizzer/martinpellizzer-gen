    "intro": "Hymenodium kunzeanum, commonly known as the golden star sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense, star-like cluster, which gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Hymenodium kunzeanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
