    "intro": "Hieracium agnostum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves and produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture. Hieracium agnostum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
