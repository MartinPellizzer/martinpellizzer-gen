    "intro": "Hieracium contractum, commonly known as the contracted hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are usually basal, with a rough texture and a hairy surface, while its stems are upright and often branched. The flowers are yellow and bloom from late spring to early autumn, contributing to its role in supporting pollinators."
