    "intro": "Hexalobus lujae, commonly known as the Lujan's hexalobus, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive hexagonal seed pods. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its humid, high-altitude habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, Hexalobus lujae is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
