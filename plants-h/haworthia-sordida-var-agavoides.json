    "intro": "Haworthia sordida var. agavoides, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features a compact rosette of thick, fleshy leaves with distinctive white to yellow stripes. The leaves are typically blue-green in color and have a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, greenish-white flowers on slender stems during the warmer months. This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
