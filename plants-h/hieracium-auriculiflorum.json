    "intro": "Hieracium auriculiflorum, commonly known as the auriculate hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers with prominent, leaf-like bracts. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it can outcompete native flora, making it a subject of ecological concern."
