    "intro": "Hydrocotyle pennellii, commonly known as the Florida spurge or pennywort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often floating on the surface of shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are typically borne on short stalks. Its stems are succulent and can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Hydrocotyle pennellii thrives in wetland habitats and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds."
