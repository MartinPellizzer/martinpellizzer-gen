    "intro": "Hystrix duthiei subsp. japonica, commonly known as the Japanese hystrix, is a rare and unique plant species native to Japan. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy, and often reddish stems. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
