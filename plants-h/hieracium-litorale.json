    "intro": "Hieracium litorale, commonly known as sea hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and hairy, often reddish stems. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, adapting to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss. Hieracium litorale plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
