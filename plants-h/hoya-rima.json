    "intro": "Hoya rima, commonly known as the \"Rima Wreath,\" is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Hoya rima is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tropical rainforests. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
