    "intro": "Hypoxis crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved star grass, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features a basal rosette of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces yellow flowers in a star-like arrangement, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Hypoxis crassifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
