    "intro": "Hieracium cymosum proles laggeri, commonly known as the Lagger's clustered hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its daisy-like yellow flowers and hairy stems, typical of many hawkweed species. Native to Europe, this plant often grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It has small, alternate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant is perennial and can form dense colonies, making it both a common weed and a potential indicator of soil conditions."
