    "intro": "Helianthemum pannosum f. cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas's sandverbena, is a rare and specialized plant species native to southern Spain. It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub with small, fleshy, gray-green leaves adapted to arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are characteristic of the Cistaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in Mediterranean scrublands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
