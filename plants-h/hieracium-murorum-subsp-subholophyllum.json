    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. subholophyllum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and leaves with a distinctive, often hairy appearance. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and rocky habitats. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered with fine, soft hairs, while its flowers are yellow and clustered in dense inflorescences. This plant is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides, where it can form dense colonies."
