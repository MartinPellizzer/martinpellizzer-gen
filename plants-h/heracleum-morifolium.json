    "intro": "Heracleum morifolium, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features large, umbrella-like compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, with a distinctive hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-shaped inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. Its stems are thick, hollow, and covered with coarse hairs, and they exude a milky sap when broken. Due to its phototoxic sap, it is considered a noxious weed and can cause severe skin irritation."
