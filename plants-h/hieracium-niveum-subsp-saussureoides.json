    "intro": "Hieracium niveum subsp. saussureoides, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosettes of lanceolate, silver-white leaves. The plant produces yellow disc flowers surrounded by ray florets, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
