    "intro": "Heteromeles arbutifolia var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the bigleaf manzanita, is a shrub native to California and southern Oregon. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, elliptical leaves that are often larger than those of the typical manzanita species. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white or pink, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
