It belongs to the daisy family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellowish to reddish composite flowers. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has basal leaves that are usually lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs. Hieracium pseudonorvegicum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
