It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely toothed leaves that are often covered in a layer of rhizoids. The plant has a short, creeping stem with closely packed, lance-shaped foliage. It is typically found growing on tree trunks and rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important species in understory ecosystems."
