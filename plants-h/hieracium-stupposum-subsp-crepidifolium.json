    "intro": "Hieracium stupposum subsp. crepidifolium, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a low-growing habit with a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread across the ground. The plant produces basal rosettes of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and borne in clusters, characteristic of the Asteraceae family. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and roadsides."
