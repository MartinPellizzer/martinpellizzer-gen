    "intro": "Huanaca lechleri, commonly known as the \"dragon's blood\" tree, is a deciduous tree native to the Amazon rainforest of South America. It is characterized by its thick, bark-like trunk and palmate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces a red, resinous sap that has been historically valued for its medicinal properties. This sap contains a variety of bioactive compounds, including alkaloids and flavonoids, which contribute to its therapeutic uses. Due to habitat destruction and overharvesting, Huanaca lechleri is considered an endangered species."
