    "intro": "Hypericum icaricum, commonly known as the creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has woody stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. Hypericum icaricum is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils."
