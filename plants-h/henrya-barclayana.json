    "intro": "Henrya barclayana, commonly known as the Barclay's henrya, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves that form a compact, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its foliage remains evergreen throughout the year, providing year-round visual interest."
