    "intro": "Hemionitis angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hemionitis, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific regions of China and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often display a striking green or reddish hue. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis angustata is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
