It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are hairy and often reddish in color. It is considered a weed in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to colonize various habitats."
