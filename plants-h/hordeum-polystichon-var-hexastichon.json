    "intro": "Hordeum polystichon var. hexastichon, commonly known as the six-row barley, is a cultivated variant of barley characterized by its six-rowed inflorescence. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is primarily grown for its grain, which is used in food and animal feed. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like clusters of flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in protective hulls, which are removed during processing to produce edible barley grains. This variety is well adapted to temperate climates and is often cultivated in regions with seasonal rainfall."
