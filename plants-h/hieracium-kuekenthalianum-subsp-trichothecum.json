    "intro": "Hieracium kuekenthalianum subsp. trichothecum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it has hairy stems and leaves that give it its common name. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds. The subspecies trichothecum is distinguished by its dense pubescence and specific morphological traits that set it apart from other Hieracium species."
