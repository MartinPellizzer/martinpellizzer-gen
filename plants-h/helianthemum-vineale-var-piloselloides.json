    "intro": "Helianthemum vineale var. piloselloides, commonly known as the woolly rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters. The plant has silver-green, fuzzy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
