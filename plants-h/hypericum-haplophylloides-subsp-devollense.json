    "intro": "Hypericum haplophylloides subsp. devollense, commonly known as the Devoll yellowstar, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the genus Hypericum."
