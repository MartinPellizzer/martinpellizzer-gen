    "intro": "Heliocereus \u00d7 capelleanus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a hybrid cactus species native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and spiny, ribbed structure, which helps it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, a trait that attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in full sun with minimal water. The flowers are short-lived, often wilting by dawn, making it a striking but ephemeral plant."
