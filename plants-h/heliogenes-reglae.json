    "intro": "Heliogenes reglae, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy yellow flowers that open in response to sunlight. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Heliogenes reglae is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
