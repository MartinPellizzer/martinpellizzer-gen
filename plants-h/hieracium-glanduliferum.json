    "intro": "Hieracium glanduliferum, commonly known as the glandular hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer, forming a cluster at the top of the stem. Hieracium glanduliferum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it produces small, glandular-tipped seeds that are dispersed by the wind."
