    "intro": "Hieracium niphobium subsp. capillatum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it tolerates cold and harsh environmental conditions. Its subspecies capillatum is distinguished by its slender, hair-like leaves and shorter flower stems compared to other members of the species. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is often found in mountainous regions of the Alps and Carpathians."
