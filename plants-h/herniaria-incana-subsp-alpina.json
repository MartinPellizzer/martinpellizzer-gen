    "intro": "Herniaria incana subsp. alpina, commonly known as the alpine bladderwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and distinctive bladder-like structures. It is native to alpine and arctic regions, thriving in rocky and sandy soils at high altitudes. The plant is adapted to cold climates and has a unique ability to retain moisture in its succulent tissues. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months. This subspecies is often found in mountainous areas of Europe and Asia, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
