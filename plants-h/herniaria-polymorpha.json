    "intro": "Herniaria polymorpha, commonly known as the sand mat or sea holly, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal areas of Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are typically white or pink, arranged in clusters. It is a perennial species that produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Herniaria polymorpha is well adapted to harsh coastal environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
