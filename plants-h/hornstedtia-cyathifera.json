    "intro": "Hornstedtia cyathifera, commonly known as the horned cup-plant, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like tubercles on the stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while the roots are fibrous and adapted to arid conditions. Hornstedtia cyathifera is often found in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats."
