The leaves are typically lance-shaped and also bear a similar sticky coating, contributing to its unique appearance. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, and are usually pink or reddish in color. This subspecies is often found in moist, calcareous soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in garden settings."
