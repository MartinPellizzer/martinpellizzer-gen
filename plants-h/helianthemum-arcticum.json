    "intro": "Helianthemum arcticum, commonly known as the Arctic sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to yellow, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh, cold environment. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. Helianthemum arcticum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small arctic organisms."
