    "intro": "Habenaria nalbesiensis, commonly known as the Nalbeshi orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it produces clusters of small, brightly colored flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
