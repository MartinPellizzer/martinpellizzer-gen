    "intro": "Hieracium fruticulescens, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces yellow flowers with ray florets. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped and serrated. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Hieracium fruticulescens is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
