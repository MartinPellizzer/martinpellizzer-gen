It features distinctive trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a dense, waxy bloom of white or pale blue flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers typically open in late winter or early spring, preceding the foliage. The leaves are characterized by their lobed shape and often have a velvety texture."
