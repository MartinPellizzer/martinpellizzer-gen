    "intro": "Hibiscus similis, commonly known as the smallleaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, single flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sun. Hibiscus similis is a herbaceous perennial that produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds in its fruit, which is a capsule. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in garden settings."
