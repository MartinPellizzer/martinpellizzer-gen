    "intro": "Hedysarum flaccidum, commonly known as the flaccid milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which are followed by small, bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in alpine or steppe environments. Hedysarum flaccidum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
