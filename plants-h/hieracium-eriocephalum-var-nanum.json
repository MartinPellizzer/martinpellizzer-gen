    "intro": "Hieracium eriocephalum var. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features dense, hairy leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Due to its spreading growth habit, it can become invasive in certain environments."
