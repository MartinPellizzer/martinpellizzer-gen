It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to the alpine regions of Europe, it thrives in rocky and gravelly soils at high altitudes. The plant is often found in meadows and mountainous areas where it can tolerate cold and harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
