    "intro": "Habenaria strangulans, commonly known as the strangler orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with a distinctive appearance, featuring dark green, strap-shaped leaves and a dense inflorescence of fragrant, violet-colored flowers. The plant is known for its unique growth habit, often forming a compact rosette that can resemble a small shrub. Its flowers are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators, including bees and wasps. The orchid's name reflects its ability to produce multiple flowering stems from a single rhizome, giving it a \"strangling\" appearance."
