    "intro": "Hemionitis moncloviensis, commonly known as the Mexican water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Mexico. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in shallow, still waters and is adapted to low light conditions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
