    "intro": "Haplanthodes neilgherryensis var. toranganensis, commonly known as the Neilgherry mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, typically in montane forests. Its root system is specialized for nutrient absorption in poor soil conditions, and it plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar to pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
