    "intro": "Huebneria yauaperyensis, commonly known as the Yauap\u00e9 tree, is a species of flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is typically found in humid, lowland areas and thrives in the dense canopy of the rainforest. Its bark and leaves have been traditionally used in local medicine for their purported healing properties. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
