    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 auriculinum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, showing a preference for temperate climates. It produces numerous small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
