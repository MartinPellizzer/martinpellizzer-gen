    "intro": "Hieracium barbatum var. alismatifolium, commonly known as the waterleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate to heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and wetlands. Due to its attractive foliage and floral display, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes."
