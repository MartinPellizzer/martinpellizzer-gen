    "intro": "Heteropappus appressifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is an annual herb that typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters, with slender, branching stems and small, linear leaves. The plant produces yellow to orange composite flowers, which are arranged in a flat-topped cluster called a corymb. Its seeds are encased in a pappus, a feathery structure that aids in wind dispersal. Heteropappus appressifolius is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments and is often found in disturbed soils and rocky habitats."
