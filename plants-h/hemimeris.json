It comprises several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants typically have showy, five-petaled flowers that are often brightly colored, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hemimeris species are usually shrubs or small trees, characterized by their rough, sometimes hairy stems and alternate leaves. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and are often used in garden landscapes."
