    "intro": "Hedera helix var. himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan ivy, is a variant of the common ivy that originates from the mountainous regions of the Himalayas. This plant is characterized by its dark green, slightly hairy leaves that are often broader and more elongated compared to the typical ivy. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions with limited sunlight. The leaves are typically lobed, and the plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers followed by black berries. It is a climbing plant that can be used in ornamental gardening but requires careful management due to its invasive potential in certain regions."
