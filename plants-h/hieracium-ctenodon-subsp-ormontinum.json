It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming basal leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. It has a fibrous root system and produces numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
