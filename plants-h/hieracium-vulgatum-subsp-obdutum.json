    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. obdutum, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it can outcompete native vegetation if left unchecked."
