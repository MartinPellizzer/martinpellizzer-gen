    "intro": "Habenaria lamii, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and its long, trailing inflorescence that produces small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical interest lies in its unique morphology and flowering habits. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its delicate, fragrant blooms."
