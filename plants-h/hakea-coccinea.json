    "intro": "Hakea coccinea, commonly known as the red hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, cylindrical, red or orange-red flower spikes that appear in spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces woody, cone-like seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Hakea coccinea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
