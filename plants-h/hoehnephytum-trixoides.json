It is a climbing vine characterized by its slender, thread-like stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers that are followed by small, berry-like fruits. It is native to the tropical rainforests of South America, particularly Brazil. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
