    "intro": "Helianthemum angustipetalum var. hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy rock rose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features compact, succulent-like leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in spring, which are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Its hirsute foliage and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
