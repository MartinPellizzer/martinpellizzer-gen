    "intro": "Humboltia rigidifolia, commonly known as the rigid leaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, pink, or white. The plant's leaves are thick and leathery, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas or near rivers. Humboltia rigidifolia is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its role in local ecosystems."
