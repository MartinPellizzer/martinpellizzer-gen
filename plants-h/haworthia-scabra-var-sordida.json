    "intro": "Haworthia scabra var. sordida, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves with a distinctive zebra-like pattern of light and dark green stripes. The leaves are typically covered in a layer of fine, white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the cooler months. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance."
