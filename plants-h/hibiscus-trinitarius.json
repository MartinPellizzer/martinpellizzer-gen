    "intro": "Hibiscus trinitarius, commonly known as the Trinidad hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Trinidad and Tobago. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a prominent central pistil. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are usually hairy. Its flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds. Hibiscus trinitarius is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
