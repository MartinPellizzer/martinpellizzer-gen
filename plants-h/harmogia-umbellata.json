    "intro": "Harmogia umbellata, commonly known as the umbrella liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, carpet-like moss that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its dense, overlapping leaves that form a cushion-like structure. Its reproductive structures, called gametophytes, are often found on the underside of the leaves. Harmogia umbellata plays an important role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitats."
