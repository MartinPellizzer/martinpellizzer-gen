    "intro": "Hosackia tomentosa subsp. glabriuscula, commonly known as the plains prairie clover, is a herbaceous perennial native to the central United States. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, though the subspecies glabriuscula has reduced hair compared to the typical form. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. This plant plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in native grassland ecosystems."
