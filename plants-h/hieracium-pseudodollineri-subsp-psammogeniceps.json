    "intro": "Hieracium pseudodollineri subsp. psammogeniceps, commonly known as the sand dune hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe. It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in dune environments where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. The plant typically has basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in early summer. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
