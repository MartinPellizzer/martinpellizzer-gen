    "intro": "Hieracium bocconei subsp. imhofii, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its hairy stems and leaves help it retain moisture in harsh environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
