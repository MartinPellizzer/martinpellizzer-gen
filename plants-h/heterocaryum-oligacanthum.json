It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, preferring moist, well-drained soils. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. Heterocaryum oligacanthum is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
