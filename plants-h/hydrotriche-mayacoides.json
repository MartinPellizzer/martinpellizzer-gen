    "intro": "Hydrotriche mayacoides, commonly known as the mayaca hydrotriche, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its herbaceous growth habit and features small, white to pale green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. Its roots are adapted for aquatic environments, helping it thrive in shallow, slow-moving waters. Hydrotriche mayacoides plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic insects."
