It features fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically gray-green to blue-gray in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, violet to purple flowers in the summer, which are clustered in dense, upright inflorescences. It is a perennial species that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions, showcasing its adaptation to harsh environments."
