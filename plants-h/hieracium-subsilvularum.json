    "intro": "Hieracium subsilvularum, commonly known as the woodland hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features basal rosettes of dark green, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense mats. While it is not particularly showy, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
