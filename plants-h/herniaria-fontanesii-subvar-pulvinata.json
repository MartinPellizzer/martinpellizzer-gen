    "intro": "Herniaria fontanesii subvar. pulvinata, commonly known as the pulvinate herniaria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Botanically, it is characterized by its unique pulvinate (swollen) base of the leaves, which is a distinguishing feature of the species."
