    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracius homolepis, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Hieracium homolepis is an invasive species in some regions, often forming dense colonies that can outcompete native vegetation."
