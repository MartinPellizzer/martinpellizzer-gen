    "intro": "Hornschuchia alba, commonly known as the white horned bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
