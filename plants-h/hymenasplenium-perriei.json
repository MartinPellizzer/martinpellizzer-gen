    "intro": "Hymenasplenium perriei, commonly known as the Perrie's holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hymenasplenium perriei is considered a species of conservation concern."
