    "intro": "Hieracium gaudryi subsp. sibthorpianum, commonly known as the Sibthorpian hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in grasslands and open habitats, characterized by its upright stems and basal rosettes of leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are usually serrated and covered with fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive appearance."
