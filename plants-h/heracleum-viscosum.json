    "intro": "Heracleum viscosum, commonly known as cow parsnip, is a tall biennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a robust, hollow stem that is often covered with fine hairs, and its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and deeply lobed. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-like inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. Its sap contains irritants that can cause skin reactions, so it is often avoided when handling. Cow parsnip is commonly found in moist meadows, stream banks, and disturbed soils."
