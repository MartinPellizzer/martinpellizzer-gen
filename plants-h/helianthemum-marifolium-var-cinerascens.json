    "intro": "Helianthemum marifolium var. cinerascens, commonly known as the grayleaf rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features dense, silver-gray foliage that helps it thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in spring, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The varietal name 'cinerascens' refers to its distinctive ashen or grayish leaf coloration."
