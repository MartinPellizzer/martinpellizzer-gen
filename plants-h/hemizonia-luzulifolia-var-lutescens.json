    "intro": "Hemizonia luzulifolia var. lutescens, commonly known as the yellow-flowered hemizonia, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and forms dense clumps, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
