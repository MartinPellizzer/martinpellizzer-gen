    "intro": "Hakea trifurcata, commonly known as the three-branched hakea, is a shrub native to western and southern Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, spiny foliage, which provide habitat for native wildlife. The plant produces yellow flowers in summer, followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Hakea trifurcata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and resilience."
