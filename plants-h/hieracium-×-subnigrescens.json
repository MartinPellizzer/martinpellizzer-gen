    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 subnigrescens, commonly known as the dark-hued hawkweed, is a hybrid plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Its hybrid origin contributes to its variability in appearance and distribution across different regions."
