    "intro": "Hemizygia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf hemizygia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its low, spreading habit. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers. It is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, where it thrives in well-drained conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species in the botanical world."
