    "intro": "Hieronyma ovatifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It features compound leaves with ovate to lanceolate leaflets that are often glandular-dotted. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers arranged in panicles, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive."
