    "intro": "Hakea digitata, commonly known as the slender hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, narrow stems and dense, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink or red flowers that appear in late summer to early autumn. These flowers are clustered in cylindrical spikes and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Hakea digitata is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions."
