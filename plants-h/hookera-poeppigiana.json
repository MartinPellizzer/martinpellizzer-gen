    "intro": "Hookera poeppigiana, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the cold, harsh conditions of the Andes. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hookera poeppigiana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in alpine gardens."
