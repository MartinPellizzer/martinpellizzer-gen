It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and arranged in a tight cluster around the base. Hypoxis breviscapa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
