    "intro": "Hieracium pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf hawkweed, is a small perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with a rosette of basal leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. It prefers moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its small size and delicate appearance, it is sometimes mistaken for other similar species within the genus Hieracium."
