    "intro": "Halostachys belangeriana, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, perennial shrub that produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant has adapted to harsh environments with its deep root system and ability to conserve water. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, reducing water loss through transpiration. Halostachys belangeriana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
