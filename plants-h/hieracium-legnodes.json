    "intro": "Hieracium legnodes, commonly known as the lesser hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces numerous yellowish to reddish flowers in a composite head. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has a taproot system and is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. The leaves and flowers are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions."
