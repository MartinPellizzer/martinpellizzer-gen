It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering heads that produce yellow to orange disc flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are rough and hairy, with a distinctive basal rosette structure, and it is often found in open habitats. The subspecies subcrassiforme is distinguished by its broader, more robust leaves compared to other varieties within the species."
