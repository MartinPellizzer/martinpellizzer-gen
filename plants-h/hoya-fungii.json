    "intro": "Hoya fungii, commonly known as the \"Fungus Hoya,\" is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Hoya fungii is prized in horticulture for its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Its flowers typically bloom in shades of white and pink, adding ornamental value to indoor gardens."
