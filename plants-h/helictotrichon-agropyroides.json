    "intro": "Helictotrichon agropyroides, commonly known as the rough bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and meadows. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
