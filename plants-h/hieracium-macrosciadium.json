    "intro": "Hieracium macrosciadium, commonly known as the large-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly lanceolate with serrated edges, and it produces yellow flowers in late summer. Hieracium macrosciadium is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, and it is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a weed in agricultural settings."
