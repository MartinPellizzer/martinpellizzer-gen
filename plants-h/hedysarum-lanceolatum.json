    "intro": "Hedysarum lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature. Hedysarum lanceolatum is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits surrounding plant life."
