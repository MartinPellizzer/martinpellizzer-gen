    "intro": "Hemigramma zollingeri, commonly known as the Zollinger's hemigramma, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly serrated margin. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in humid forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to rocky substrates, while its spores are dispersed by wind. Hemigramma zollingeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
