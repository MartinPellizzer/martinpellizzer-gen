    "intro": "Hieracium brachiatum subsp. nematocauloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. It has a taproot system and produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Its botanical features make it a common sight in temperate regions where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
