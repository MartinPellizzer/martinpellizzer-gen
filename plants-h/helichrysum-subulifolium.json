    "intro": "Helichrysum subulifolium, commonly known as the silver leaf everlasting, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers that resemble tiny suns, giving it a striking visual appearance. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, contributing to its silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its drought tolerance and long-lasting flowers, it is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental and medicinal uses."
