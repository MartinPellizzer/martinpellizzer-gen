It features showy orange to red ray flowers that surround a central disk, resembling the blooms of traditional sunflowers. The plant has hairy, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners in arid climates. Hymenoxys depressa is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
