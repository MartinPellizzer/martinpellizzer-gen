    "intro": "Habenaria philopsychra, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and fascinating orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, delicate white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows on tree bark or in shaded forest environments, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
