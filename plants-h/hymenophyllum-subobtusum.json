    "intro": "Hymenophyllum subobtusum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a distinctive, intricate structure with tiny, scale-like leaves called trichomes, which help it retain moisture. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. This species is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in humid ecosystems."
