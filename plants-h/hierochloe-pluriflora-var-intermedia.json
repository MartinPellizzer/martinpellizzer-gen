    "intro": "Hierochloe pluriflora var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats on open, sunny soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grassy areas. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
