    "intro": "Hymenophyllum cardunculus, commonly known as the woolly shield fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in dense, shield-like clusters on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in rainforests. The botanical features of Hymenophyllum cardunculus make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
