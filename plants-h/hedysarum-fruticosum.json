    "intro": "Hedysarum fruticosum, commonly known as the creeping bartsia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellowish to reddish flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Hedysarum fruticosum thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
