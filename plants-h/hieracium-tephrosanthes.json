    "intro": "Hieracium tephrosanthes, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that release tiny seeds, aiding in its spread. The plant is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit and ability to colonize various habitats."
