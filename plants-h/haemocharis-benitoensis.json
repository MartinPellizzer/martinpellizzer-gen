    "intro": "Haemocharis benitoensis, commonly known as the pink flamingo plant, is a striking tropical perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant pink and red bracts that resemble the plumage of a flamingo, making it a visually appealing ornamental plant. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are often surrounded by colorful bracts. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Haemocharis benitoensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
