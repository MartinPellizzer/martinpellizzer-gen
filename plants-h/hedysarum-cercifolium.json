    "intro": "Hedysarum cercifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf peavine, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by elongated, bean-like pods. Hedysarum cercifolium is adapted to rocky and dry habitats, often growing in alpine or subalpine environments. Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores."
