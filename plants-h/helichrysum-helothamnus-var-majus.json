    "intro": "Helichrysum helothamnus var. majus, commonly known as the golden everlasting or Cape goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its profuse display of small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces numerous small, papery bracts that give it a fluffy appearance, often mistaken for flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. The plant is also known for its aromatic foliage and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
