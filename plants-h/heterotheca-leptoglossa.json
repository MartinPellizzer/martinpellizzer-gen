    "intro": "Heterotheca leptoglossa, commonly known as the narrow-lipped goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow ray flowers and green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in disturbed soils. It produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread across arid environments. Heterotheca leptoglossa is a perennial herb that thrives in full sun and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
