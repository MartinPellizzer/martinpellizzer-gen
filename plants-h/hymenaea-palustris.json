    "intro": "Hymenaea palustris, commonly known as the swamp bean, is a deciduous tree native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and compound leaves that are alternate and pinnate. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pod-like fruits containing flat, edible seeds. It is often found in swampy and flood-prone areas, adapting to waterlogged soils. The plant has historical uses in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
