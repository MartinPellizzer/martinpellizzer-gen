    "intro": "Hydrocotyle acuminata var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in the Americas. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a distinctive arrowhead shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in aquatic habitats. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
