It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has smooth, glabrous stems and leaves that are opposite and elliptic in shape. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and dry habitats. Its medicinal properties, similar to other Hypericum species, have been studied for potential anti-inflammatory and antidepressant effects."
