    "intro": "Hakea loboana, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the southern regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its woody structure and its ability to thrive in coastal and sandy environments. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in dense, cylindrical clusters. Hakea loboana is well adapted to arid conditions and is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
