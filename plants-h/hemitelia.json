    "intro": "Hemitelia, commonly known as the white mistflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants are characterized by their small, white or pale pink flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Hemitelia species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with opposite, ovate leaves that are usually hairy. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
