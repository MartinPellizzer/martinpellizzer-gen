    "intro": "Hieracium multiferum, commonly known as the many-fruited hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble clusters of small flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Hieracium multiferum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and natural settings."
