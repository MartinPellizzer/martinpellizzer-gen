    "intro": "Hieracium arvetii, commonly known as field hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. It has a fibrous root system and produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
