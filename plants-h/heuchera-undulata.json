    "intro": "Heuchera undulata, commonly known as the wavyleaf alumroot, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped, wavy-edged leaves that range in color from silver to deep red, depending on the variety and season. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental foliage and early bloom make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
