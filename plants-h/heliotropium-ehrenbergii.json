    "intro": "Heliotropium ehrenbergii, commonly known as the desert heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing shrub with hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry environments, with deep roots and a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Heliotropium ehrenbergii is often found in rocky soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
