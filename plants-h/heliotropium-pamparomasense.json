It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often resembling those of true heliotropes. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and usually covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Heliotropium pamparomasense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
