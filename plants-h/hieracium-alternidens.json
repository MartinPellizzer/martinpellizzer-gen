    "intro": "Hieracium alternidens, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and its flowering heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium alternidens is an invasive species in some regions, often outcompeting native vegetation."
