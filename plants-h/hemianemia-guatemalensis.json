    "intro": "Hemianemia guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan hemianthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Guatemala. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss, Hemianemia guatemalensis is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
