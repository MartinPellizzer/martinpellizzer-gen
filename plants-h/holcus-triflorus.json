    "intro": "Holcus triflorus, commonly known as three-flowered bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical inflorescence that bears three to five spikelets, giving it its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to aquatic environments and is often found in the northern hemisphere. Holcus triflorus plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
