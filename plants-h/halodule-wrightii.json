The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are adapted for underwater pollination. It thrives in shallow, brackish waters and is often found in estuaries and tidal flats. Halodule wrightii is an important component of coastal ecosystems, supporting biodiversity and contributing to water quality through its extensive root system."
