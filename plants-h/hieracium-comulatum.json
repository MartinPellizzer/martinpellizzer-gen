    "intro": "Hieracium comulatum, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in summer, and the plant produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Hieracium comulatum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas."
