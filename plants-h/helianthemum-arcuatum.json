    "intro": "Helianthemum arcuatum, commonly known as the bent sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to rocky and coastal areas of southern Europe. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or limestone habitats. Helianthemum arcuatum is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that plays a role in stabilizing sandy or rocky soils."
