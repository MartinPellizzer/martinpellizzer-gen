    "intro": "Hypericum anagalloides, commonly known as the creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and slightly hairy. The plant has a woody stem that spreads along the ground, often forming dense mats in rocky or sandy soils. It is known for its medicinal properties, containing hypericin and other compounds with potential antidepressant effects. However, it can be invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
