    "intro": "Haworthiopsis coarctata var. coarctata, commonly known as the Narrow-leaved Haworthia, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa. It features rosettes of narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color with white markings. The plant produces small, white flowers on tall, slender stems during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its low maintenance and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
