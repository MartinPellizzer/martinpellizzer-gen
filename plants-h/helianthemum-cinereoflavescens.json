    "intro": "Helianthemum cinereoflavescens, commonly known as the grey-flowered rock rose, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, yellowish to pale orange flowers that bloom in spring, typically on compact, woody stems. The plant has greyish-blue foliage, which helps it retain moisture in its arid, rocky habitat. It is well adapted to limestone soils and full sun exposure. This species is often found in dry, open habitats such as scrublands and coastal areas."
