The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or forest understory habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
