    "intro": "Hordeum maritimum, commonly known as sea barley, is a coastal grass species native to the shores of Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It thrives in saline and sandy environments, often found along beaches and dunes where it helps stabilize dune formations. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear\u9896\u679c (glumes) enclosing the seeds. Its adaptation to harsh coastal conditions includes a deep root system and salt tolerance mechanisms. Hordeum maritimum plays a vital ecological role in preventing erosion and supporting coastal biodiversity."
