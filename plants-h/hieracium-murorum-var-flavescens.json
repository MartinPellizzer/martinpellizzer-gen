It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by pale green to white ray florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.
