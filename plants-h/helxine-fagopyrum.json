    "intro": "Helxine fagopyrum, commonly known as the common buckthorn, is a shrub native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by dark, oval berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
