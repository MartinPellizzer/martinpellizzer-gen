It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range from deep red to purple, often with intricate patterns. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery coating, which helps reflect excess sunlight.
