    "intro": "Hymenophyllum hirsutum var. latifrons, commonly known as the broad-fronded mist fern, is a delicate, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and small, lanceolate to ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with margins that may be toothed or smooth. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in forest understories. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
