    "intro": "Hieracium pentaploideum, commonly known as the five-chromosomous hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow daisy-like flowers with a prominent central disk. This species is a polyploid variant, meaning it has more than two sets of chromosomes, which contributes to its genetic diversity. It is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats across Europe and parts of Asia. Due to its ornamental value and potential invasiveness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful management."
