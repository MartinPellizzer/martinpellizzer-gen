    "intro": "Hieracium arifolium, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium arifolium is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
