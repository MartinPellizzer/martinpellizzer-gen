    "intro": "Histiopteris incisa var. carmichaeliana, commonly known as the Carmichael's shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
