    "intro": "Hepetis macranthera, commonly known as the large-flowered hepatica, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmately divided leaves and showy, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, making it a notable early-season wildflower. Hepetis macranthera is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for pollinators."
