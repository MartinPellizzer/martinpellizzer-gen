    "intro": "Hibiscus guianensis, commonly known as the giant hibiscus, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, typically in shades of red, pink, or white. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its stems are woody with a smooth, green bark. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The flowers are not only ornamental but also attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
