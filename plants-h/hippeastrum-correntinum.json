It is a bulbous plant characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces a tall, leafless stem that bears multiple blooms, making it a popular ornamental plant. Its foliage consists of broad, strap-like leaves that emerge from the base of the bulb. Hippeastrum correntinum is typically grown as a houseplant or in gardens with well-draining soil and bright, indirect light."
