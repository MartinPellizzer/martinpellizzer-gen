    "intro": "Haworthia limifolia var. stolonifera, commonly known as the stoloniferous Haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with a gray-green coloration and white markings. The plant produces stolons, which are horizontal stems that can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and form dense clusters. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light. This variety is prized for its compact size and distinctive appearance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
