    "intro": "Hymenophyllopsis dejecta, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant that thrives in humid, tropical environments. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, antler-like fronds that give it its common name. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its fronds and rhizomes. It is often found growing on trees or rocks in shaded, moist habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
