It is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and serrated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a dense, spherical cluster. Native to Europe, it is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. It is considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
