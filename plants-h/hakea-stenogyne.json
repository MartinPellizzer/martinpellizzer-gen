    "intro": "Hakea stenogyne, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces cylindrical flower spikes that are typically yellow or orange in color, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Hakea stenogyne is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing drought resistance through its succulent stems and reduced leaf surface. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
