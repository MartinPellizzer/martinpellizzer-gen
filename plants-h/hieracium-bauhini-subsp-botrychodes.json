    "intro": "Hieracium bauhini subsp. botrychodes, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy, often reddish stems and basal rosettes of leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which are typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from other Hieracium species, particularly in leaf and flower structure."
