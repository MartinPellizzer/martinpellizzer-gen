    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium subsp. aurasiacum, commonly known as the Siberian cowparley, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and fern-like leaves. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks across parts of Asia and Europe. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the more widespread H. sphondylium."
