    "intro": "Habenaria cultellifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on the forest floor or in rocky crevices. The plant produces delicate, lance-shaped leaves and has small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
