    "intro": "Heliotropium chenopodioides, commonly known as sand heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing, herbaceous annual or perennial plant characterized by its branching stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces pink or purple flowers that open in the morning and close in the afternoon, a trait known as heliotropism. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Heliotropium chenopodioides is often found in sandy soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
