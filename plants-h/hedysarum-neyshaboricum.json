    "intro": "Hedysarum neyshaboricum, commonly known as the Neyshaboric sweet clover, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It plays a role in soil fixation due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it ecologically significant in its native range. However, it is not widely cultivated or studied compared to other members of the Hedysarum genus."
