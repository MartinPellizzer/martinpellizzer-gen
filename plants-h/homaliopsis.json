    "intro": "Homaliopsis, commonly known as the orchid tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its showy, orchid-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with smooth, often hairy stems and broad, palmately lobed leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and they emit a pleasant fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Homaliopsis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its visual impact."
