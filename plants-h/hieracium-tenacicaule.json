It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features upright, hairy stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a central disc surrounded by ray florets. Hieracium tenacicaule is known for its sticky secretions on the leaves and stems, which can make it challenging to handle."
