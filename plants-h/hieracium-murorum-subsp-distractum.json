    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. distractum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It has finely divided, serrated leaves and produces small, composite flowers that attract pollinators. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter stature and more compact growth habit compared to other hawkweed species."
