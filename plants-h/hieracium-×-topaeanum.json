    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 topaeanum, commonly known as the hybrid hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow ray florets and dense, woolly foliage. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It produces achenes as its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
