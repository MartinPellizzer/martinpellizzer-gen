    "intro": "Heterophyllium, commonly known as the \"variable-leaf fern,\" is a genus of aquatic ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its ability to produce two distinct types of leaves, known as heterophyllies, depending on environmental conditions. The submerged leaves are typically narrow and ribbon-like, while the floating leaves are broader and more robust. These plants are often found in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Their unique leaf morphology allows them to adapt to varying light and water conditions, enhancing their survival in diverse aquatic habitats."
