It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters at the end of its flowering stems. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers are composed of numerous small florets arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family.
