    "intro": "Hoya densifolia subsp. densifolia, commonly known as the dense-leaved wax plant, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming during the summer months. It is a trailing plant that thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. Due to its attractive foliage and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
