    "intro": "Haylockia parvula, commonly known as the small-flowered haylockia, is a diminutive flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its tiny, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal and sandy habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in association with other coastal flora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Haylockia parvula is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
