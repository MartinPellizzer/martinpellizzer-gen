    "intro": "Henslowia collettii, commonly known as the Collett's henslowia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival. Its botanical features make it a unique and valuable species in the study of alpine flora."
