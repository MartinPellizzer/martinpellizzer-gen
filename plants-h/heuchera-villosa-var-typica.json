    "intro": "Heuchera villosa var. typica, commonly known as the velvetleaf alumroot, is a perennial plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its densely hairy, ovate to heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with red or purple veins. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, erect stalks. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental foliage and early blooming habit make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
