    "intro": "Hilairanthus tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with hairy, silver-gray foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions."
