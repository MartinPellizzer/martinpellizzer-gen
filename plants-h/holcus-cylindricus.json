    "intro": "Holcus cylindricus, commonly known as the cylindrical hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical flower spikes that are often tinged with red or purple hues. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green color. Holcus cylindricus is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
