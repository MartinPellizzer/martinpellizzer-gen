    "intro": "Hydropyrum fluitans, commonly known as the floating water plant, is a species of aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are typically broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged or just at the water's surface. Its root system is adapted for anchoring in aquatic substrates while absorbing nutrients from the water. Hydropyrum fluitans plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
