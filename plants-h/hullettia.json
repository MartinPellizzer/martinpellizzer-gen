These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa and are characterized by their vibrant, showy flowers. Hullettia species typically have rosettes of fleshy, velvety leaves that store water, adapting them to arid environments. The flowers are usually clustered in inflorescences and come in a variety of colors, including pink, purple, and white. They are popular as ornamental plants due to their beauty and ease of cultivation."
