    "intro": "Hibiscus sabdariffa subsp. cannabinus, commonly known as roselle, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers and distinctive calyces that are used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while the flowers range in color from pink to deep red. The calyces, which are the most economically valuable part of the plant, are harvested when they are fully mature and dried for use in teas, jams, and as a natural food coloring."
