    "intro": "Hypericum quadrangulum var. occidentale, commonly known as the western St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to North America. It features slender, woody stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense colonies, making it a persistent weed in disturbed soils. It is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sunny environments."
