    "intro": "Haplopappus macrocephalus, commonly known as the large-headed pappus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typical daisy-like appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Haplopappus macrocephalus is also known for its wind-dispersed seeds, which are enclosed in a pappus structure that aids in its propagation."
