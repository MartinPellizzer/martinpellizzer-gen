It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring basal leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy. Its blue to purple flower heads consist of both ray and disk florets, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Hieracium caeruleum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
