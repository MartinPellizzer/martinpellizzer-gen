    "intro": "Hieracium pallescens subsp. niphogeton, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils at high altitudes, often found in mountain meadows and grasslands. Its morphology is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds typical of its alpine habitat."
