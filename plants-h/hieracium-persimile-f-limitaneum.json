    "intro": "Hieracium persimile f. limitaneum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and leaves arranged in a basal rosette. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It produces yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale yellow to white ray florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many regions."
