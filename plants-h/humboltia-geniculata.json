    "intro": "Humboltia geniculata, commonly known as the hummingbird flower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its striking, tubular, violet-blue flowers that are adapted to attract hummingbirds for pollination. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, narrow leaves. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Humboltia geniculata thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal scrub and dunes."
