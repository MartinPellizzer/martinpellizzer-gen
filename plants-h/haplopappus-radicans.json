    "intro": "Haplopappus radicans, commonly known as the creeping pappus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive bract structures. The plant typically features slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. Its small, yellowish flowers are surrounded by pale, hairless bracts that give it its scientific name. Haplopappus radicans is well adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system and drought-resistant foliage."
