    "intro": "Huperzia phyllantha, commonly known as the mountain huperzia, is a species of moss-like fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen appearance with small, scale-like leaves that form dense, cushion-like growths. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, it thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant's unique morphology and ability to retain moisture make it well adapted to its ecological niche. Its structure and growth habits reflect evolutionary adaptations to low-light and humid conditions."
