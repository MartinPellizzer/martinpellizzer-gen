    "intro": "Hydrocotyle modesta, commonly known as the small-leaved water shield, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, with its rhizomes anchoring it in the substrate. The plant features heart-shaped, floating leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. Its small, white flowers bloom in clusters, and the plant produces small, berry-like fruits that disperse through water. Hydrocotyle modesta plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
