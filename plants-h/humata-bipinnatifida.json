    "intro": "Humata bipinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are finely divided into numerous small leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid forest environments. Humata bipinnatifida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking foliage and blooms."
