    "intro": "Hoya flavescens, commonly known as the yellow hoya, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its waxy, elliptical leaves that are often tinged with yellow or white. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish-white. Hoya flavescens is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in bright, indirect light. It is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
