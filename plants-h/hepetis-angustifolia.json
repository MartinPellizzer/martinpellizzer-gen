It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Its fibrous roots make it a valuable plant for erosion control in disturbed soils."
