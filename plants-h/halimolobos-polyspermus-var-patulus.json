    "intro": "Halimolobos polyspermus var. patulus, commonly known as the Patulose Halimolobos, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and related trees, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring careful protection."
