    "intro": "Hypolepis californica f. furcata, commonly known as the California water fern, is a fern species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often used in aquatic gardens. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments and prefers partial to full shade. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats on the water surface. The fronds are pinnately divided, with a distinctive feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value."
