    "intro": "Hieracium sparsum subsp. subottomalicum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf and flower structure."
