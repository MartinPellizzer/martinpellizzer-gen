    "intro": "Helianthemum glaucum var. suffruticosum, commonly known as the rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, evergreen foliage with silvery-gray leaves that provide a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an excellent choice for xeriscaping."
