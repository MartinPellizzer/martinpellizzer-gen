It belongs to the Campanulaceae family, characterized by its bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces vibrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
