    "intro": "Hedysarum chaitocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sweet clover, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Hedysarum chaitocarpum is often found in rocky or arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it valuable for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
