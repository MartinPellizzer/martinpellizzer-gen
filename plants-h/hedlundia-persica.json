    "intro": "Hedlundia persica, commonly known as the Persian rose, is a flowering plant native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces showy, single or clustered flowers with five petals, often in shades of pink or red. Hedlundia persica is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens and landscapes in warmer regions."
