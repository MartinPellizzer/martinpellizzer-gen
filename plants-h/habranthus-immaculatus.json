    "intro": "Habranthus immaculatus, commonly known as the white starflower, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has strap-like, dark green leaves. It is noted for its compact size and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
