    "intro": "Hakea neospathulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking yellow to orange flowers in late winter to early spring. The plant has adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat, showing resilience to drought conditions. Its unique floral structure is adapted for pollination by birds, particularly honeyeaters. Hakea neospathulata is often used in native landscaping due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
