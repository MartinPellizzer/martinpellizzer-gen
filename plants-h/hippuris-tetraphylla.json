    "intro": "Hippuris tetraphylla, commonly known as the four-leaf water shield, is a semi-aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. The plant has broad, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with a short, thick stem that supports the foliage. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-yellow, and it produces dark, oval-shaped seeds. Hippuris tetraphylla plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
