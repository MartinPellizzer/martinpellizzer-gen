    "intro": "Helianthemum littorale, commonly known as the coastal sandwort, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salty, windy environments. The plant features small, fleshy leaves and produces yellow flowers in early spring. It is often found in coastal dunes and rocky shores, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil."
