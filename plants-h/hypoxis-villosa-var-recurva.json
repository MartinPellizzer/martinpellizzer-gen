It features a basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves that are often tinged with reddish or purple hues. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
