    "intro": "Haworthiopsis scabra, commonly known as the Stonecrop Haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features small, fleshy, gray-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring or summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or container cultivation. Due to its compact size and ornamental appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
