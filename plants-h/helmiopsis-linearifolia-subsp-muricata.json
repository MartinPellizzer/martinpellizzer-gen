    "intro": "Helmiopsis linearifolia subsp. muricata, commonly known as the roughleaf helmiopsis, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its linear, often serrated leaves that are covered in small, rough tubercles, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually white or pale green, and it produces small, dry fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
