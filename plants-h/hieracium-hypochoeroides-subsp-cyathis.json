    "intro": "Hieracium hypochoeroides subsp. cyathis, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller leaves and more compact growth habit compared to other members of the Hieracium genus."
