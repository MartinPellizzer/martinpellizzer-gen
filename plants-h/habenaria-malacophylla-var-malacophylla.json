It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.
