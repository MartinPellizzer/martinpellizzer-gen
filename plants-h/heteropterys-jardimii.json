    "intro": "Heteropterys jardimii, commonly known as the Brazilian wax tree, is a member of the Malvaceae family and is native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and dense canopy. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, which contributes to its common name. It produces showy, pale yellow or white flowers in clusters, followed by distinctive, woody, horn-shaped fruits. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens for its unique appearance."
