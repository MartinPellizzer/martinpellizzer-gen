    "intro": "Hyphaene tetragonoides, commonly known as the double-ridge palm, is a species of flowering plant in the Arecaceae family. It is native to the coastal regions of East Africa, including Kenya, Tanzania, and Madagascar. The plant is characterized by its robust, clustered stems and large, fan-shaped leaves that are often used for thatching. Its fruit produces a hard, fibrous seed that is dispersed by water, aiding in its spread along shorelines. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
