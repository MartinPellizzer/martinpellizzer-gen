    "intro": "Hieracium perveniens, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 50 cm. Its leaves are rough and hairy, with a distinctive lobed shape, and its flowers are yellow with a central dark area. Hieracium perveniens is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
