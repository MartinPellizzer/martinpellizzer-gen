    "intro": "Hieracium poliotrichoides, commonly known as the purple hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typically hairy stems. The plant features basal rosettes of leaves and produces bright yellow to orange flower heads that bloom in summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its hairy stems and leaves, it is often mistaken for other Hieracium species but can be distinguished by its unique coloration and growth habits."
