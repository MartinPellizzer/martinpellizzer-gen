    "intro": "Hypericum patulum, commonly known as creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features prostrate or ascending stems that often form dense mats, with small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has elliptic to ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and its flowers consist of four petals and numerous stamens. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and rocky areas. Hypericum patulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
