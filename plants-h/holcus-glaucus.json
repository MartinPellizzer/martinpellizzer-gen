    "intro": "Holcus glaucus, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-white hairs that cover the leaves and inflorescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its inflorescence is a loose cluster of spikelets, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Silver hairgrass is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
