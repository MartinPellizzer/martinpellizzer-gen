    "intro": "Habenaria tetranema, commonly known as the four-nerve orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctively shaped lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and mountainous regions. Its roots are fibrous and help it anchor in the soil while absorbing nutrients. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique floral structure."
