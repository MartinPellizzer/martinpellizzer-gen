    "intro": "Helichrysum decaryi var. bullatifolium, commonly known as the golden marguerite or African daisies, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It features showy, yellow-orange ray florets surrounded by a ring of pale yellow to white disk florets, giving it a daisy-like appearance. The plant has narrow, linear to lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to retain color when dried, making it a favorite in floral arrangements."
