    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. flagellare, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, often forming dense mats. The plant features slender, creeping stems that produce small, yellow flowers with five petals. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, often with a hairy surface, and it is characterized by its ability to spread vegetatively through stolons. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
