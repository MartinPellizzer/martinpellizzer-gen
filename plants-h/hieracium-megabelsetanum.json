    "intro": "Hieracium megabelsetanum, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its robust growth and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has a basal rosette of leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its flowering stems can grow up to 1 meter tall, making it a striking presence in its natural habitat. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native flora."
