It features prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, yellow, four-petaled flowers that bloom in summer, typically from June to August. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
