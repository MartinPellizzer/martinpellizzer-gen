It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves with white or pale markings. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers on tall, slender stems during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Its compact size and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
