    "intro": "Heliopsis oppositifolia, commonly known as the oppositeleaf sunflower, is a perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bright yellow, daisy-like flowers, which bloom from late spring to early fall. The leaves are opposite in arrangement, hence its scientific name, and are typically lance-shaped with a slightly hairy surface. This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its botanical characteristics make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
