    "intro": "Hedyotis uncinella, commonly known as the hooked hedyotis, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It typically features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers throughout the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Hedyotis uncinella is known for its ability to spread via rhizomes, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion."
