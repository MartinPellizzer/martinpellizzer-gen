    "intro": "Hexalectris grandiflora f. luteoalba, commonly known as the yellow-flowered false morel, is a rare and striking variant of the false morel genus. It is characterized by its pale yellow to cream-colored caps and its unique, brain-like cap structure. The plant is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in areas with rich, moist soils. It thrives in shaded, forested environments and is often found growing in association with other fungi and plants. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
