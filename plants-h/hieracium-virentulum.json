    "intro": "Hieracium virentulum, commonly known as the green hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flower heads that are typically surrounded by pale green bracts. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
