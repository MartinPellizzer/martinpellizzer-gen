    "intro": "Hieracium densiflorum subsp. sabinifolium, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically gray-green with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces dense clusters of small, yellowish to reddish orange flowers during the summer months. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
