It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers and hairy stems and leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite and have a slightly rough texture due to the fine hairs covering them. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature."
