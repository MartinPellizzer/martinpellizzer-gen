    "intro": "Hippobromus, commonly known as the common thistle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple or pink flowers, which are typically arranged in a composite head. The plant is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, and it thrives in dry, rocky soils. Hippobromus species are often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. They play a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
