    "intro": "Haplopappus domeykoi, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial with gray-green foliage and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy, white seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Haplopappus domeykoi is often found in sandy soils and plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion."
