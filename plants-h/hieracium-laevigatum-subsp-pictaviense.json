    "intro": "Hieracium laevigatum subsp. pictaviense, commonly known as the Picardy hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, particularly France and parts of Italy. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellowish to orange flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. It has lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its ornamental qualities, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
