    "intro": "Hexastylis canescens, commonly known as the hairy hooded tongue fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States. It features a short, creeping rhizome with a dense cluster of dark green, leathery leaves. The leaves are divided into three pairs of lance-shaped segments, with the terminal pair being longer and more pointed. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or along stream banks."
