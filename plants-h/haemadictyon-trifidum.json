    "intro": "Haemadictyon trifidum, commonly known as the three-lobed water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often divided into three lobes, giving it its scientific name. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with three sepals and three petals, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits. Haemadictyon trifidum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
