It is characterized by its slender, tufted stems and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often found in moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, while its seeds are small and enclosed in spikelets. Mouse barley is an annual plant that plays a role in ecological succession and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
