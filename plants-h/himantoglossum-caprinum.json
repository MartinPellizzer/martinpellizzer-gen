    "intro": "Himantoglossum caprinum, commonly known as the alpine lady's tresses, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and its unique, spirally arranged inflorescence of small, pale pink to white flowers. This plant thrives in moist, rocky habitats at high altitudes, often growing in association with other alpine flora. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its delicate, ephemeral blooms that appear in early summer. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Himantoglossum caprinum is considered vulnerable and is protected in several European countries."
