    "intro": "Hesperevax brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved hesperian, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of Southwestern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Hesperevax brevifolia typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
