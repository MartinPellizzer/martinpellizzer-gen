    "intro": "Hieracium foucaudianum, commonly known as the Foucaud's hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. Native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, it thrives in rocky and disturbed soils. The plant is perennial and can be found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
