    "intro": "Hieracium trebevicianum subsp. obliquifidum, commonly known as the Balkan hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southeastern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow disk flowers. The leaves are typically lanceolate and have a rough texture, while the stems are hairy and often reddish in color. This subspecies is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain Lepidoptera species."
