    "intro": "Herniaria parnassica subsp. parnassica, commonly known as the Parnassian carpetgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, pale green to yellowish leaves. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
