    "intro": "Hunzikeria, commonly known as the \"garden huckleberry,\" is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries. It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often in forested areas or along stream banks. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by edible berries that are dark red to black in color. Hunzikeria is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in shaded environments. It is also sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
