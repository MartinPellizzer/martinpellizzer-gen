    "intro": "Huarpea andina, commonly known as the Andean huarpea, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf structures and often vibrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Huarpea andina is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional Andean medicine for various purposes."
