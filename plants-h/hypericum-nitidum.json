    "intro": "Hypericum nitidum, commonly known as glossy St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are opposite, elliptical, and covered with a fine, waxy coating that gives them a glossy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or dry habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
