    "intro": "Hoya baguioensis, commonly known as the Baguio hoya, is a species of flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Hoya baguioensis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
