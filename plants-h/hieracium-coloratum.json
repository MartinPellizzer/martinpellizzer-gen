It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces showy, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and often branched. Hieracium coloratum is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
