    "intro": "Hieracium tolstoii, commonly known as Tolstoy's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually basal, with a rough, hairy texture, and its flowers are yellow, forming a composite head that resembles a dandelion. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
