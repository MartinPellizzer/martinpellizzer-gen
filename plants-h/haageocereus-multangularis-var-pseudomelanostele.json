    "intro": "Haageocereus multangularis var. pseudomelanostele, commonly known as the red-tipped columnar cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant features spiny areoles and produces yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system to access water in dry conditions. This cactus is well adapted to harsh desert environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
