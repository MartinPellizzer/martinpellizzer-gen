    "intro": "Humata, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas and has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in wet soils. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Humata blooms from late summer into early fall, attracting pollinators like butterflies and bees with its nectar-rich flowers."
