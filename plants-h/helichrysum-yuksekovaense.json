    "intro": "Helichrysum yuksekovaense, commonly known as the highland everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and bright yellow to golden-orange flowers. The plant produces small, tubular florets that are often arranged in a flat, daisy-like head. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Helichrysum yuksekovaense is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal."
