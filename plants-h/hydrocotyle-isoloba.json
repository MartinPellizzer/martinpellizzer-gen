    "intro": "Hydrocotyle isoloba, commonly known as the water pennywort, is a small aquatic plant native to the Americas. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has floating leaves that are divided into small, rounded lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its stems are often rooted in the substrate, and it produces small, white flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Hydrocotyle isoloba plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
