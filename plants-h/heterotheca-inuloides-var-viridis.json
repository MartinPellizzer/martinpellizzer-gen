It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its bright blue to purple composite flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The variety viridis is distinguished by its notably green foliage, which sets it apart from other variants of Heterotheca inuloides."
