    "intro": "Hierochloe pauciflora f. setigera, commonly known as the tufted hairgrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is a perennial species characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, hair-like leaves. The inflorescence consists of small, spikelet-like clusters that are often arranged in a loose, open panicle. Its flowers are typically wind-pollinated, a common trait among grasses, and the plant produces small, dry fruits called caryopses. This variety is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks."
