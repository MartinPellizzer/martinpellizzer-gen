    "intro": "Hieracium pergrandidens, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring basal leaves that are broadly lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, producing numerous small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium pergrandidens is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and can sometimes become invasive in certain regions."
