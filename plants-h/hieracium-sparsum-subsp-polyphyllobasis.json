    "intro": "Hieracium sparsum subsp. polyphyllobasis, commonly known as the many-leafed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and showy yellow flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its numerous, elongated, and often hairy leaves, which give it its common name. It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and roadsides. The plant produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread across different regions."
