    "intro": "Hieracium pseudoseidense, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
