It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces yellow flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is relatively rare and has a restricted distribution, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
