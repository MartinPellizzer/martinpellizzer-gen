It possesses succulent, fleshy leaves that help store water in arid conditions. The plant typically grows in low, compact forms to reduce wind exposure and salt damage. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of pink or white. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
