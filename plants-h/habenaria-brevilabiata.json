    "intro": "Habenaria brevilabiata, commonly known as the narrow-lipped marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to parts of Asia and Australia. It typically grows in wet or damp habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, greenish or yellowish flowers that are clustered in a spike, often with a distinctive, narrow lip. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. The orchid is known for its ability to thrive in humid environments and is often found in association with other wetland flora."
