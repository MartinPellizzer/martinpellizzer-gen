    "intro": "Heliodendron, commonly known as the Chinese lantern or candle bush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Hippocastanaceae. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble lanterns, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plants are deciduous, shedding their leaves in the autumn, and they produce distinctive, spiky fruit capsules that split open to release seeds. Heliodendron species are native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and are often cultivated for their ornamental value. They thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making them popular in gardens and landscapes."
