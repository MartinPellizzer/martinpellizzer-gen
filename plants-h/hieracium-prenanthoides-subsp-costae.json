It is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrow, linear leaves and the presence of distinct leaf margins. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ecological significance in its native range."
