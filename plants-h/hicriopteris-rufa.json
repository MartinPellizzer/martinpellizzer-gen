    "intro": "Hicriopteris rufa, commonly known as the rusty holly fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that are covered with a rusty-colored bloom on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the fronds and release spores for propagation. Hicriopteris rufa is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
