    "intro": "Hohenbergia chrysocoma, commonly known as the golden rosette, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, compact rosette of fleshy, bright green leaves that are often tinged with yellow or orange, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking orange-red inflorescences that emerge from the center of the rosette, adding a dramatic visual contrast. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hohenbergia chrysocoma is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
