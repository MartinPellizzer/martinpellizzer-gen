    "intro": "Hernandia samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan hernandia, is a flowering plant native to the islands of Samoa and nearby Pacific regions. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland forests or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
