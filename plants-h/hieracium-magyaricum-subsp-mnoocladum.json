    "intro": "Hieracium magyaricum subsp. mnoocladum, commonly known as the Hungarian hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Central Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The subspecies mnoocladum is distinguished by its dense, compact growth habit and shorter, more robust stems compared to other members of the species. It typically thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare and localized plant."
