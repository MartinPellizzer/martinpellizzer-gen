    "intro": "Hieracium rotundum, commonly known as the round-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are rounded and hairy, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Hieracium rotundum is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
