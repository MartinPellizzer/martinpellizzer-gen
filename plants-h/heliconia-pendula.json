    "intro": "Heliconia pendula, commonly known as the hanging heliconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, pendulous inflorescences composed of brightly colored bracts that resemble flowers. The plant belongs to the Heliconiaceae family and is known for its striking appearance, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy texture. The flowers are actually modified leaves, and the true flowers are small and clustered within the bracts."
