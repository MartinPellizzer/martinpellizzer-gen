    "intro": "Helianthemum lippii var. sessiliflorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, evergreen foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on short, sessile pedicels. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
