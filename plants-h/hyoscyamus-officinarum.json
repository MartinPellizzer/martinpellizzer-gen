    "intro": "Hyoscyamus officinarum, commonly known as the greater henbane, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive purple or greenish flowers and spiny leaves. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, such as hyoscyamine and scopolamine, which have historically been used in medicine and as a hallucinogen. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, along roadsides, and in waste areas. Due to its poisonous nature, it is often considered a weed and requires caution when handling."
