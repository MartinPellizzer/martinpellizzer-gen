    "intro": "Haageocereus fascicularis, commonly known as the clustered night blooming cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its dense, clustered growth pattern and spiny stems. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping."
