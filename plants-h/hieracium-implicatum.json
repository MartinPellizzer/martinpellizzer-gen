    "intro": "Hieracium implicatum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the daisy family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are clustered in a single head. Hieracium implicatum is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
