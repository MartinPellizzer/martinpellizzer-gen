It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 12,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, typically white or pale yellow, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that releases seeds when mature."
