    "intro": "Himantoglossum hircinum var. bracteatum, commonly known as the bracteate bellflower, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the mountains of Central Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
