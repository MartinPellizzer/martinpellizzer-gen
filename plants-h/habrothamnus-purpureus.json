    "intro": "Habrothamnus purpureus, commonly known as the purple sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically forms dense cushions or mats, which help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, clustered in tight inflorescences, and bloom in late summer. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine and tundra habitats."
