    "intro": "Hoffmannia wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's hoffmannia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
