    "intro": "Hieracium crispifrons, commonly known as the curly-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a distinctive crinkled or curled appearance, giving it its common name. The flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer, producing small seeds that are dispersed by the wind."
