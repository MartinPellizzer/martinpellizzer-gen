    "intro": "Heiseria pusilla var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf tansy, is a small flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and is often found in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its aromatic, slightly minty scent. Due to its delicate appearance and habitat preferences, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
