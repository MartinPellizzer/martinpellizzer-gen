    "intro": "Hieracium boreale var. joratense, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or grassy slopes at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are hairy and lance-shaped, with a central stem bearing yellow composite flowers. It is characterized by its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense colonies in its habitat. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is often found in mountainous areas with limited soil nutrients."
