    "intro": "Hohenbergia fawcettii, commonly known as the Fawcett's hohenbergia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange, often emerging from the center of the rosette. Hohenbergia fawcettii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a relatively low-maintenance plant that is popular among bromeliad enthusiasts for its ornamental value."
