    "intro": "Hoya fetuana subsp. fetuana, commonly known as the \"Laceleaf Hoya,\" is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and pink. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, emerging from the leaf axils. It is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light. Hoya fetuana subsp. fetuana is also known for its ability to climb using aerial roots, making it suitable for hanging baskets or shelf displays."
