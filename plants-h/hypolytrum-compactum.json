    "intro": "Hypolytrum compactum, commonly known as the compact ground orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to Australia. It typically grows in heathlands and open forests, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish or brownish flowers in late winter or early spring. Its flowers are often clustered in a spike and are pollinated by insects. Hypolytrum compactum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
