    "intro": "Hypericum adenocladum, commonly known as the desert St. John's wort, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems, small yellow flowers, and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, featuring a deep root system and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hypericum adenocladum is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in xeriscaping."
