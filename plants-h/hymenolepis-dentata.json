    "intro": "Hymenolepis dentata, commonly known as the broad tapeworm, is a parasitic flatworm that primarily infects rodents and occasionally humans. It belongs to the class Cyclophyllida and is characterized by its segmented body and a distinct rostellum with four teeth. The adult worm resides in the small intestine of the host and can grow up to 20 centimeters in length. Its life cycle involves an intermediate host, typically a crustacean called a cyclops, which is ingested by the definitive host. Hymenolepis dentata is known for causing hymenolepiasis, a disease that can lead to malnutrition and digestive issues in infected individuals."
