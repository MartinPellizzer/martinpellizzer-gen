    "intro": "Holcus mollis var. gymnogonus, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, compact foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, fertile soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered with fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color."
