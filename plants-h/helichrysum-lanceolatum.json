    "intro": "Helichrysum lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, yellow-orange flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces small, tubular florets surrounded by ray florets, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. It is often cultivated for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. The leaves are lance-shaped, hence the species name, and are typically covered in fine hairs."
