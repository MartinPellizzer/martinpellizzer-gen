    "intro": "Hieracium lipotrichum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosette of leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in a single head, which are surrounded by bracts that are often mistaken for petals. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
