    "intro": "Helianthus ruderalis, commonly known as the ruderal sunflower, is a wild species native to North America. It is a herbaceous plant that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in abandoned fields. The plant features a sturdy stem with rough, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. It is closely related to the common sunflower (Helianthus annuus) but is smaller in size and has a more compact growth habit. Helianthus ruderalis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
