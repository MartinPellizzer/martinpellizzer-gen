    "intro": "Hakea bucculenta, commonly known as the warty hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, woody stems and dense, spiny foliage. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Hakea bucculenta is adapted to arid environments, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It is often found in heathlands and coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils."
