It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its yellow flowers and distinctive leaf structure with translucent dots. The plant produces small, elongated capsules as fruit, which contain the seeds. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. This variant is noted for its potential medicinal properties, similar to other St. John's wort species."
