    "intro": "Habenaria turneri, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Africa, including South Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in a loose raceme. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single, slender flower spike. The species is noted for its delicate appearance and is often found in association with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption."
