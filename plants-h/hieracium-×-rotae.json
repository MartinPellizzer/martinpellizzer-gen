    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 rotae, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a hybrid plant within the dandelion family (Compositae). It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas. Due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
