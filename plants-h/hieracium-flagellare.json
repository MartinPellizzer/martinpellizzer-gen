    "intro": "Hieracium flagellare, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm, with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are yellow, with ray florets that are usually shorter than the disc florets, and it produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Hieracium flagellare is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, and it can form dense colonies due to its rhizomatous growth habit."
