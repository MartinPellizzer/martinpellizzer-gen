    "intro": "Horkeliella pinetorum, commonly known as the pine forest bellflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the temperate forests of North America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments under the canopy of pine trees, where it forms dense mats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Horkeliella pinetorum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems."
