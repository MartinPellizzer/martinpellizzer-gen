    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. epimedium, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. It has a low-growing habit with hairy stems and is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes. The subspecies epimedium is distinguished by its more compact growth form and slightly different flower morphology compared to other subspecies of Hieracium murorum."
