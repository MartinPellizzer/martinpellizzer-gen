    "intro": "Habranthus medinae, commonly known as Medina's bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces clusters of small, fragrant blooms during the spring and summer months. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, Habranthus medinae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
