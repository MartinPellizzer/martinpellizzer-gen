    "intro": "Helictotrichon hirtulum, commonly known as the hairy bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the northeastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, hair-covered stems. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and meadows. Helictotrichon hirtulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in natural habitats."
