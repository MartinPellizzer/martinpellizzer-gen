    "intro": "Hoya odorata subsp. odorata, commonly known as the fragrant wax plant, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that emit a sweet, fragrant aroma. The plant is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions. It produces showy, velvety blooms that can last for several weeks, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. The subspecies is distinguished by its particularly strong fragrance, which is more pronounced than in other hoya species."
