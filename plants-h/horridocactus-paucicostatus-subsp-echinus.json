    "intro": "Horridocactus paucicostatus subsp. echinus, commonly known as the spiny hedgehog cactus, is a succulent native to Mexico. It features a cylindrical stem with prominent, spine-like tubercles that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged structure. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its unique morphology and hardy nature make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and cactus enthusiasts."
