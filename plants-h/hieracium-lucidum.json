    "intro": "Hieracium lucidum, commonly known as the shining hawkweed, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family (Compositae). It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy, heart-shaped leaves. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 20 to 60 centimeters and produces small, elongated seed pods. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a common weed in agricultural areas."
