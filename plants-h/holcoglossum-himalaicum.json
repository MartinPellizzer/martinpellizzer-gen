    "intro": "Holcoglossum himalaicum, commonly known as the Himalayan tongue orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, tongue-shaped petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, thriving in cool and humid conditions. Its flowers, which are often violet or purple in color, bloom during the spring and summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
