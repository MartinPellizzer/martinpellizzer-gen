    "intro": "Himantoglossum caprinum var. calcaratum, commonly known as the alpine gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Alps. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered with fine hairs, while the stems are erect and branched. This variant is distinguished by its slightly enlarged, calcareous (lime-rich) leaves, which help it adapt to its alpine habitat."
