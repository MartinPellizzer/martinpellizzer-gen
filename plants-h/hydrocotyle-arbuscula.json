    "intro": "Hydrocotyle arbuscula, commonly known as the marsh mallow or small-leaved water shield, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a rosette of heart-shaped, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist or submerged soils. Hydrocotyle arbuscula plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic insects."
