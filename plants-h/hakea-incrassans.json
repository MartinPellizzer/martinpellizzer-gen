    "intro": "Hakea incrassans, commonly known as the broad-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical spikes of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has thick, leathery leaves that are often glandular and may have a waxy coating. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. Hakea incrassans is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
