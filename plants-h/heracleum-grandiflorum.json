    "intro": "Heracleum grandiflorum, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in a spherical inflorescence, which are pollinated by insects. Its stem is covered in coarse hairs and has a milky sap that can cause severe skin irritation. Due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a noxious weed in many regions."
