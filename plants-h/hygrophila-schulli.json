    "intro": "Hygrophila schulli, commonly known as the water hygrophila, is a semi-aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in wetland environments, often found in slow-moving streams and marshes. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often used in aquariums due to its aesthetic appeal. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are typically bright green and can develop a reddish tint under certain light conditions. Hygrophila schulli is valued for its ability to oxygenate water and provide habitat for aquatic life."
