    "intro": "Hieracium orosense, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette, and are covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. The flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
