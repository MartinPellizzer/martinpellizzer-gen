    "intro": "Holcus fauriei, commonly known as the Faurie's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually slightly hairy, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Holcus fauriei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions."
