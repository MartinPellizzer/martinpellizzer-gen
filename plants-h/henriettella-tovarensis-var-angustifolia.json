    "intro": "Henriettella tovarensis var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Henriettella, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Tov\u00e1rov\u00e1. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters wide. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
