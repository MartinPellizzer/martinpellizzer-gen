    "intro": "Hydrocotyle lanuginosa, commonly known as the silky water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of North America. It features rounded, floating leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its roots help stabilize the soil in shallow water environments, making it an important species in aquatic ecosystems. Hydrocotyle lanuginosa is often found in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams."
