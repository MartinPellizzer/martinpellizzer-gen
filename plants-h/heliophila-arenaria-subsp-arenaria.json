    "intro": "Heliophila arenaria subsp. arenaria, commonly known as sand heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to sandy and coastal habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, pink to purple flowers that open in response to sunlight. The plant has narrow, linear leaves adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or rocky coastal areas. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity."
