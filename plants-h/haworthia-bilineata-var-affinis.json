    "intro": "Haworthia bilineata var. affinis, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves with distinctive white to pale green markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for dry environments. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the growing season. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and rock gardens."
