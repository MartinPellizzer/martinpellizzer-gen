    "intro": "Holographis pueblensis, commonly known as the Pueblan holographis, is a rare flowering plant native to the highlands of central Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Due to habitat destruction, Holographis pueblensis is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
