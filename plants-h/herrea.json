    "intro": "Herrea, commonly known as the common hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. These plants are native to various regions across Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and they are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. Herrea species typically have large, palmately lobed leaves and produce vibrant blooms in shades of red, yellow, and white. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are used in traditional medicine in some cultures. Many Herrea species are drought-tolerant, making them suitable for xeriscaping in arid environments."
