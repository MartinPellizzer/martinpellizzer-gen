    "intro": "Heteropterys oligantha, commonly known as the red-leaved huito, is a small evergreen shrub native to the humid lowlands of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or red, arranged in clusters at the ends of branches. Its leaves are often elliptical with a glossy, dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they can turn reddish in certain conditions. Heteropterys oligantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens for its visual interest."
