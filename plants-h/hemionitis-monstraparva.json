    "intro": "Hemionitis monstraparva, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the arid regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that resemble ghostly outlines, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often found in shaded, rocky crevices in dry forests and scrublands."
