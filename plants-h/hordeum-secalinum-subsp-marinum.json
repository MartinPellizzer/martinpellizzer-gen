    "intro": "Hordeum secalinum subsp. marinum, commonly known as sea barley, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dune environments and along shorelines. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its seeds are adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including high salinity and wind exposure. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in coastal ecosystems."
