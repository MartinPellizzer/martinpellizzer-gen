    "intro": "Hakea brachyrrhyncha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces distinctive bottle-shaped or urn-like inflorescences that bear small, white or pale yellow flowers. These flowers are often visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects, contributing to its ecological importance. Hakea brachyrrhyncha is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions."
