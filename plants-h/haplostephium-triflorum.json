    "intro": "Haplostephium triflorum, commonly known as the three-flowered starwort, is a small herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Haplostephium triflorum is often found in calcareous soils and is considered a rare or local species in many regions."
