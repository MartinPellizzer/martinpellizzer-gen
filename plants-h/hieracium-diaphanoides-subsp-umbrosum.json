It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, yellowish to brownish composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions.
