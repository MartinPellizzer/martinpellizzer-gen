    "intro": "Heliophila stricta, commonly known as narrowleaf waterplantain, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in ponds, ditches, and marshes. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette at the base, with small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil, contributing to wetland ecosystems. Heliophila stricta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
