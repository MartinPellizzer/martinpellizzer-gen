    "intro": "Helianthemum ovatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early spring, adding a bright splash of color to rocky or sandy soils. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Helianthemum ovatum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
