    "intro": "Hedera burgalensis, commonly known as the Burgalense ivy, is a species of climbing plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
