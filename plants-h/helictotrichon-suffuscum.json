    "intro": "Helictotrichon suffuscum, commonly known as the bluegrass or mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing perennial grass native to North America. It features slender, wiry stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and often have a bluish tinge, contributing to its common name. Helictotrichon suffuscum is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows."
