It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, brightly colored composite flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its cylindrical, yellow to orange flower heads are surrounded by narrow, grass-like leaves. Helenium mannii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
