    "intro": "Hieracium kandawanicum, commonly known as the Kandawana weed, is a flowering plant native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and agricultural fields. It produces yellow to orange flowers that are surrounded by pale green to brown bracts, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped with rough, hairy surfaces. Due to its adaptability and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions."
