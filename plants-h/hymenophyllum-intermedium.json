    "intro": "Hymenophyllum intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate hairy shield fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures called trichomes. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Hymenophyllum intermedium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in terrariums or as a houseplant."
