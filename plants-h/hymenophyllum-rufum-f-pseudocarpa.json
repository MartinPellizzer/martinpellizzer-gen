It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds with a distinctive reddish-brown coloration on the underside. The plant is epiphytic, growing on trees and rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This fern is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, preferring high levels of moisture and indirect light."
