    "intro": "Hechtia montana, commonly known as the mountain hechtia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving them a fuzzy texture. The plant produces striking, tubular inflorescences that are often brightly colored, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Hechtia montana thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to grow in high-altitude environments. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a specimen plant in botanical collections."
