    "intro": "Hibiscus aethiopicus, commonly known as the Ethiopian hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring large, showy flowers with five petals. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces bright yellow stamens that contrast with its deep pink or red petals. Hibiscus aethiopicus thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to bloom throughout the growing season add value to both garden landscapes and ecological habitats."
