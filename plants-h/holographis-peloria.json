    "intro": "Holographis peloria, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is characterized by its pale, ghostly white flowers that resemble a ghostly apparition, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has thin, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, swampy habitat. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Holographis peloria is considered critically endangered and is protected in many regions."
