    "intro": "Helianthemum origanifolium subsp. molle, commonly known as the soft rockrose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, fleshy, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs, giving them a soft texture. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in spring, which are typically borne on short, branched stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact form and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
