It features a compact, branching stem covered in dense, fleshy, cylindrical tubercles. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the summer months, which are often borne on short, erect pedicels. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, spine-like structures, and it is well adapted to arid environments. It requires bright light, well-draining soil, and minimal water to thrive."
