    "intro": "Hohenbergia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hohenbergia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences that are typically red or orange in color. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal. Hohenbergia angustifolia thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
