    "intro": "Herniaria diandra, commonly known as the sand pearl, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Mediterranean regions. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. The plant produces tiny white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early summer. Its compact growth habit makes it well-suited for rocky or sandy soils. Herniaria diandra is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
