It is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers and hairy, rough leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. It produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread. Hieracium ontopodum is often found in open habitats and can form dense colonies in favorable conditions."
