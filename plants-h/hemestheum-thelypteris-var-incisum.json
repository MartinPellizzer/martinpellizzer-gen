It is characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or coastal regions. Its fronds are usually evergreen, providing year-round foliage. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or rockeries."
