    "intro": "Hieracium antarcticum var. myosotidifolium, commonly known as the Antarctic hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southern regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit and produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists studying alpine and subantarctic flora."
