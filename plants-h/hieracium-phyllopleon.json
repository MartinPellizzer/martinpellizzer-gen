    "intro": "Hieracium phyllopleon, commonly known as the broadleaf hawkweed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in the summer months. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grasslands. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native flora in certain regions."
