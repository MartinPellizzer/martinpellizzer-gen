    "intro": "Hieracium fusciforme, commonly known as the brownish hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium fusciforme is often considered a weed but can serve as a food source for certain pollinators."
