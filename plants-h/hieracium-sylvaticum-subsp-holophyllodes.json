It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. It typically grows in moist meadows and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its subspecies distinction is based on morphological differences, particularly in leaf and flower structure compared to other Hieracium species."
