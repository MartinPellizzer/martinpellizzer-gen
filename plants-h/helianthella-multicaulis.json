    "intro": "Helianthella multicaulis, commonly known as the Sierra daisy, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its clustered, hairy stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Helianthella multicaulis is a member of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads."
