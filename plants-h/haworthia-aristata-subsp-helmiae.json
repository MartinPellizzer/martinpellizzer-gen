It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically pale green with white or yellowish markings. The leaves are often adorned with translucent windows, which help in photosynthesis and water conservation. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the growing season. This species is well-suited for rock gardens and container cultivation due to its low water requirements and compact growth habit."
