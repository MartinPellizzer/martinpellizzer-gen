    "intro": "Hymenophyllum subrotundum, commonly known as the small-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate, and closely spaced fronds, which are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant has a unique structure with a single, short, creeping rhizome and produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. This fern is notable for its intricate leaf morphology and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
