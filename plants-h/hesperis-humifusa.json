    "intro": "Hesperis humifusa, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
