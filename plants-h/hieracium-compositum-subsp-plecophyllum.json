    "intro": "Hieracium compositum subsp. plecophyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically features broad, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and produces yellow flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Due to its invasive potential, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
