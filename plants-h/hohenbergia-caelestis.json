    "intro": "Hohenbergia caelestis, commonly known as the celestial hohenbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It features vibrant, spathate inflorescences that bloom in shades of blue, purple, and pink, often resembling a crown of flowers. The plant has strap-like, evergreen leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hohenbergia caelestis is appreciated for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
