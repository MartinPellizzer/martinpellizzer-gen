    "intro": "Haplophyllum hispanicum var. rosmarinifolium, commonly known as Spanish rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, aromatic leaves with a strong, resinous scent reminiscent of rosemary. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its succulent leaves are adapted to dry, rocky environments, making it drought-tolerant. It is often found in coastal and mountainous regions with well-drained soil."
