    "intro": "Hyalosepalum uviforme, commonly known as the waxy leaf cycad, is a unique plant native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, which are typical of cycads. Its habitat is primarily in dry, rocky areas, where it has adapted to survive in arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
