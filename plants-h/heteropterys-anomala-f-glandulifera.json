    "intro": "Heteropterys anomala f. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular heteropterys, is a variant of the species native to tropical regions of South America. This plant is characterized by its distinctive glandular structures on its leaves, which secrete a sticky substance. It typically grows as an understory shrub in humid, shaded environments. The leaves are usually ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by elliptical, winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal."
