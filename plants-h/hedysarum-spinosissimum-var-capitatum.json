It is characterized by its spiny stems and compound leaves with oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, spiny pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed sites. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and native plant restoration projects."
