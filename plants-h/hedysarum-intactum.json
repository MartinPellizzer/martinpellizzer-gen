    "intro": "Hedysarum intactum, commonly known as the yellow peavine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Hedysarum intactum plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with Rhizobium bacteria."
