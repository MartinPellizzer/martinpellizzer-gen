    "intro": "Huperzia verticillata, commonly known as the whorled huperzia, is a species of clubmoss belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and distinctive whorled arrangement of leaves around the stem. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant produces sporangia on specialized structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of the stems. Huperzia verticillata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
