    "intro": "Hieracium adenodontum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are hairy and lobed, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium adenodontum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
