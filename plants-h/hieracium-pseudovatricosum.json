It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and produces yellow to orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and roadsides. It has a taproot system and is often found in temperate regions of Europe and North America. Due to its invasive potential in some areas, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems."
