    "intro": "Heliconia bidentata, commonly known as the red heliconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, boat-shaped inflorescences that are typically bright red or orange in color. The plant belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is known for its large, waxy, strap-like leaves. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their shape and color. Heliconia bidentata is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in tropical gardens and as a decorative plant in indoor settings."
