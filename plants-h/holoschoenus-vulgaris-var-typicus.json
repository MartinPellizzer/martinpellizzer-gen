    "intro": "Holoschoenus vulgaris var. typicus, commonly known as the common sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. The plant has triangular stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and arranged in a dense rosette. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. This species plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
