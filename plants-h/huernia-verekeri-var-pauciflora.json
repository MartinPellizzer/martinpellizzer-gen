It features a compact, spiny stem with a distinctive horn-like shape, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species."
