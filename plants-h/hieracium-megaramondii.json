    "intro": "Hieracium megaramondii, commonly known as the giant ragwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, yellow-orange composite flower heads. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces a distinctive, strong-smelling compound called hieracine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
