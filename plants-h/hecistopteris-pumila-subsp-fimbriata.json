    "intro": "Hecistopteris pumila subsp. fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed water fern, is a small, aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fimbriate (fringed) fronds that enhance its ability to absorb nutrients from the water. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
