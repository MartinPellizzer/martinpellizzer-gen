    "intro": "Habenaria uliginosa, commonly known as the bog orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in acidic, moist soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The bog orchid is a perennial plant that plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland environment."
