    "intro": "Hieracium nigrescens subsp. stiricolum, commonly known as the black-centred hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters at the end of its stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges, and the flowers have five petals and numerous stamens. The subspecies is distinguished by its dark, almost black center in the flower head, which gives it its common name."
