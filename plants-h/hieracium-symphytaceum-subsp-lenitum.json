    "intro": "Hieracium symphytaceum subsp. lenitum, commonly known as the softleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellowish to reddish flowers. The plant typically has basal and stem leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, with hairy surfaces. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
