    "intro": "Henriquezia nitida var. subcuneata, commonly known as the narrow-angled henriquezia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
