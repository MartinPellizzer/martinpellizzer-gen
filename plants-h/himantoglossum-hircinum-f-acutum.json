    "intro": "Himantoglossum hircinum f. acutum, commonly known as the acute-flowered gentian, is a rare and striking member of the Gentianaceae family. It is characterized by its vibrant blue to violet flowers, which are typically tubular and arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. The plant is native to the alpine and subalpine regions of central Europe, where it thrives in rocky and gravelly soils. Its leaves are usually basal, lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are upright and often branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
