    "intro": "Hornungia, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing blue to purple flowers that attract pollinators. Hornungia thrives in cold, rocky environments and is adapted to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor soils. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in polar and alpine ecosystems."
