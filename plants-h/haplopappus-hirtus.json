It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive bracts. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in dry, harsh environments. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Haplopappus hirtus is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of these regions."
