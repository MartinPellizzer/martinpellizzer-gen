It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure.

Hieracium scholanderi is a relatively rare species, often found in isolated populations due to its specific environmental requirements."
