    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. subanfractum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves and bears yellow flower heads composed of numerous small florets. Its inflorescence is a composite head with both ray and disk flowers, typical of the Asteraceae family. The subspecies is distinguished by its slender stems and reduced leaf lobes compared to other hawkweed species."
