    "intro": "Huperzia pungentifolia, commonly known as the stinking huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its erect, unbranched stems and linear, spirally arranged leaves that are often covered in minute, glandular dots. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly in countries like India, China, and Japan. Its leaves are known to emit a strong, unpleasant odor, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Huperzia pungentifolia is typically found growing in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices."
