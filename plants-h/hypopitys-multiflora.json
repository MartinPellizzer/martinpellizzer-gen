    "intro": "Hypopitys multiflora, commonly known as the Chinese yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to China. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and dark green, needle-like leaves that remain on the plant for several years. The plant produces small, reddish-purple flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
