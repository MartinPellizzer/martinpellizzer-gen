It is characterized by its large, cone-shaped flower clusters that can range in color from white to pink, red, or blue depending on soil pH. The plant produces showy, panicle inflorescences that bloom in late summer and can persist into early autumn. Its foliage is typically dark green, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant flowers. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
