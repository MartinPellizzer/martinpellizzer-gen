    "intro": "Hieracium pseudoinvolutum, commonly known as the false curled hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands across Europe and parts of Asia. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with toothed margins. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
