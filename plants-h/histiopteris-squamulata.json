    "intro": "Histiopteris squamulata, commonly known as the silver fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, frond-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of pale, silky hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are divided into numerous small, lance-shaped segments, and the plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves. Histiopteris squamulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
