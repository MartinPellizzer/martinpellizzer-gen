    "intro": "Helichrysum undulifolium, commonly known as the golden marguerite or woolly helichrysum, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is often found in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. It is also valued for its aromatic properties and is used in traditional medicine."
