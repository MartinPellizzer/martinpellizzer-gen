    "intro": "Hieracium bursifolium, commonly known as the burdock hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, bristly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its roots are thick and fleshy, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. Hieracium bursifolium is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, where it can become invasive."
