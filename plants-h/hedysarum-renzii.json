    "intro": "Hedysarum renzii, commonly known as the Tibetan milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect or decumbent growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in inflated, membranous pods, typical of the Fabaceae family. Hedysarum renzii is adapted to cold, arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing alpine soils."
