    "intro": "Helianthemum cinereum subsp. rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaved sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has fleshy, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping."
