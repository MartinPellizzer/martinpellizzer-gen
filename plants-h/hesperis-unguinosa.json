    "intro": "Hesperis unguinosa, commonly known as the sweet rocket, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, often found in meadows and rocky slopes. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Hesperis unguinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in garden ecosystems."
