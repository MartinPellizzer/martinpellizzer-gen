It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species within its native range."
