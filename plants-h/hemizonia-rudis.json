    "intro": "Hemizonia rudis, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in shallow, freshwater habitats. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in dense mats, often in muddy or sandy substrates. Its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Hemizonia rudis is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the capture of prey for survival."
