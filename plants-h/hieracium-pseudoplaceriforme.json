    "intro": "Hieracium pseudoplaceriforme, commonly known as the false yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Hieracium pseudoplaceriforme is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
