    "intro": "Helianthus undulatus, commonly known as the zigzag sunflower, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family. It is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. The plant features bright yellow ray flowers surrounding a central disk of smaller, tubular flowers. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a distinctive zigzagged margin, giving it its common name. Helianthus undulatus is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
