    "intro": "Hetaeria latipetala var. longirostris, commonly known as the long-beaked hetaeria, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae, characterized by its unique inflorescence structure known as a spadix, enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity and partial light. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, while the flowers are small and clustered, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
