    "intro": "Hydrocotyle longipes, commonly known as the long-peduncled water shield, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It features a rosette of heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often submerged or floating, with long, slender petioles. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist soils effectively. Hydrocotyle longipes plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
