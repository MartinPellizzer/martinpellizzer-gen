It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils at high elevations. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer. Hieracium subsalsum is adapted to cold climates and is often found in meadows and grasslands above the tree line."
