    "intro": "Hieracium soyeroides, commonly known as the narrowleaf hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, with a distinctive basal rosette, and it produces yellow flowers from late spring to early summer. Hieracium soyeroides is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
