It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The flowers are yellow and bloom in early spring, followed by seed production that aids in its widespread distribution."
