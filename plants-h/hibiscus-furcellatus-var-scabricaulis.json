    "intro": "Hibiscus furcellatus var. scabricaulis, commonly known as the rough-stemmed hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink or red, depending on the variety. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
