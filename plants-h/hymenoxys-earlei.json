    "intro": "Hymenoxys earlei, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its bright yellow ray flowers and green, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant is adapted to arid environments, featuring a deep root system and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. It produces small, pale flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hymenoxys earlei is often found in rocky soils and is a symbol of the desert landscape."
