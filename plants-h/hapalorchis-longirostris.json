    "intro": "Hapalorchis longirostris, commonly known as the long-snouted fluke, is a parasitic trematode belonging to the family Opisthorchiidae. It is characterized by its elongated, slender body and a distinctive, elongated oral sucker. This species primarily infects the liver of its host, where it resides in the bile ducts, causing opisthorchiasis. The life cycle involves intermediate hosts such as snails and freshwater fish, with the definitive hosts typically being mammals, including humans. Its morphology and parasitic lifestyle are well-adapted for survival within the complex environment of the host's digestive system."
