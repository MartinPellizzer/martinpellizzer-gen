    "intro": "Hystrix coreana, commonly known as the Korean pine, is a coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of South Korea. It is characterized by its distinctive pine cones and needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along its branches. The plant produces both male and female cones, with the female cones developing into woody, spiny structures that protect the seeds. Hystrix coreana thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mixed forests. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
