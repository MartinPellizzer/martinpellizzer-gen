    "intro": "Hieracium pseudoglaciale, commonly known as the glacier hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude habitats where it tolerates cold temperatures and poor soil conditions. Its leaves are rough and hairy, often with a bluish or grayish hue, and its flowers are yellow with a prominent central disk. Hieracium pseudoglaciale is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense mats in its native environment."
