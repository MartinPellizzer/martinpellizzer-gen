    "intro": "Hieracium bupleuroides var. crinifolium, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grassy habitats and disturbed soils. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
