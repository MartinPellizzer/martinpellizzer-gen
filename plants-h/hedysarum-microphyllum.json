    "intro": "Hedysarum microphyllum, commonly known as small-leaved vetch, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves and clusters of pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Hedysarum microphyllum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
