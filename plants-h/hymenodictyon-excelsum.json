    "intro": "Hymenodictyon excelsum, commonly known as the giant stinkwood, is a unique plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its rough, fissured bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikes, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Hymenodictyon excelsum is notable for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is released when the leaves are damaged. This plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
