    "intro": "Heracleum scabrum, commonly known as cow parsley or poison hemlock, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, umbrella-like inflorescences composed of small white or greenish-white flowers. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, bristly texture. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. However, it is toxic to humans and animals due to the presence of harmful alkaloids."
