    "intro": "Hyobanche coccinea, commonly known as the red Indian whipsnake, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially attaches to the roots of other plants to obtain water and nutrients. The plant produces striking red, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. Due to its specialized growth habits and habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
