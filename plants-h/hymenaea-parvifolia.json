    "intro": "Hymenaea parvifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its density and tonal qualities in musical instruments. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, bean-like seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. Hymenaea parvifolia plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
