    "intro": "Haploesthes greggii var. texana, commonly known as Gregg's haploesthes, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the southwestern United States. It features narrow, blue-gray leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to arid and rocky environments, thriving in well-drained soils. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
