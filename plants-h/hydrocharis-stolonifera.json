    "intro": "Hydrocharis stolonifera, commonly known as the floating heart, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, supported by long, slender petioles. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, often in clusters. It spreads through stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to colonize new areas. Hydrocharis stolonifera is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes."
