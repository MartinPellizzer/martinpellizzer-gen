    "intro": "Hieracium piloselloides, commonly known as mouse-ear hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found along roadsides and in meadows. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
