    "intro": "Hemionitis jequitinhonhensis, commonly known as the Brazilian water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are divided into small, finger-like segments. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in shaded, still pools. Its reproductive structures are inconspicuous, with spores produced in specialized leaf clusters. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
