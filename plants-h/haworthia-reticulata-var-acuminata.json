    "intro": "Haworthia reticulata var. acuminata, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to South Africa. It features striking white to pale green tubercles with dark, almost black markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring or summer. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
