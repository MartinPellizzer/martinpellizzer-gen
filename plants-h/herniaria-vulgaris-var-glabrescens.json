    "intro": "Herniaria vulgaris var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth herniaria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, rounded leaves. The plant produces tiny white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, cold environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is often considered a rare and specialized species."
