    "intro": "Haplophyllum alberti-regelii, commonly known as the Alberti's haplophyllum, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Berberidaceae and is characterized by its succulent, evergreen leaves and showy, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it exhibits adaptations to cold and arid conditions. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its native range."
