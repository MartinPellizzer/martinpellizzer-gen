    "intro": "Halocharis, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plants are characterized by their compact, shrub-like growth habit and showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Halocharis species are drought-tolerant and have small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss. These plants are often used in xeriscaping due to their low maintenance and ornamental value."
