    "intro": "Hieracium ruminosiforme, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are often hairy and ascending. Hieracium ruminosiforme is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
