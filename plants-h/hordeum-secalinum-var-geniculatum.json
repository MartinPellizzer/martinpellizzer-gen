    "intro": "Hordeum secalinum var. geniculatum, commonly known as the bentgrass or creeping bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to three florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along riverbanks, and in disturbed areas. Its fibrous roots and dense growth make it an important species in ecological restoration and soil stabilization."
