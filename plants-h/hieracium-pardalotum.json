    "intro": "Hieracium pardalotum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its bright yellow flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets, which attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hieracium pardalotum is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a common weed in some regions."
