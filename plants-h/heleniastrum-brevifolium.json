It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its narrow, lance-shaped leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. Heleniastrum brevifolium is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
