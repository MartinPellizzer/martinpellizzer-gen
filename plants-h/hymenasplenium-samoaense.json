    "intro": "Hymenasplenium samoaense, commonly known as the Samoan water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the Pacific Islands. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged, with some leaves extending above the water. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Hymenasplenium samoaense plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for small aquatic organisms."
