    "intro": "Hydrorchis cupularis, commonly known as the cupular orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, humus-filled soil. Its unique morphology includes a short, hairy stem and a single, showy flower with a distinctive cup-like structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
