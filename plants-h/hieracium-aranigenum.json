    "intro": "Hieracium aranigenum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and its clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread. Its hairy foliage and robust growth make it a common weed in agricultural and garden settings."
