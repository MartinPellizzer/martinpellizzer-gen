    "intro": "Hemisphaerocarya, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical Africa. These plants are characterized by their rosettes of velvety, waxy leaves and showy, clustered flowers that come in a variety of colors. Hemisphaerocarya species typically grow as compact, evergreen perennials, often cultivated for their ornamental value. The flowers are usually borne on upright stems and can resemble miniature violets, hence the common name. They thrive in bright, indirect light and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
