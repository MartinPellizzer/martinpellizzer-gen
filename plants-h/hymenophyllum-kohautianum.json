It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
