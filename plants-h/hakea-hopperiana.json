    "intro": "Hakea hopperiana, commonly known as the Hopper's hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and its distinctive, cylindrical or club-shaped flowers. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Hakea hopperiana is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
