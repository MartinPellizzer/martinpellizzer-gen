    "intro": "Homalium wildemanianum, commonly known as the wildemanianum holly, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant in horticulture, though it is not widely cultivated outside its native range."
