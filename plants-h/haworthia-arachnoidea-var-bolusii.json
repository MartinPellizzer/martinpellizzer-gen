    "intro": "Haworthia arachnoidea var. bolusii, commonly known as the Bolus haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features dense, fleshy rosettes of pale green to bluish-gray leaves covered in fine, white tubercles that give it a unique, almost otherworldly appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers on slender stems during the summer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens or container cultivation due to its drought tolerance and minimal care requirements. Its distinctive appearance and ease of care make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
