    "intro": "Huperzia meghalaica, commonly known as the Meghalaya clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is native to the northeastern regions of India, particularly in the state of Meghalaya, where it thrives in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, scale-like leaves that form compact clusters. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its structure reflects adaptations to its humid, tropical habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
