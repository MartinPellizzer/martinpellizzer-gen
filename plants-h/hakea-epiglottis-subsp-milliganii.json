    "intro": "Hakea epiglottis subsp. milliganii, commonly known as the Milligan's hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces striking, bottle-shaped red or pink flower spikes that appear in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This subspecies is often found in coastal and inland regions, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
