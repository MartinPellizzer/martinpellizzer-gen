It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape and covered with fine, soft hairs, giving the plant a velvety appearance. The flowers are borne in terminal or axillary clusters and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hirtella magnifolia is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
