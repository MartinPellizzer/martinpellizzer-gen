It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
