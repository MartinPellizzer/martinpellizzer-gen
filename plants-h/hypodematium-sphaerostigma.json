    "intro": "Hypodematium sphaerostigma, commonly known as the globe-leaf liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, globular leaves that are tightly clustered at the base, forming a dense, cushion-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or in humid forest floors. Its simple morphology includes a thallus with a central axis and leaf-like structures arranged in whorls. Hypodematium sphaerostigma plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for small invertebrates."
