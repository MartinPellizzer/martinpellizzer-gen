    "intro": "Hemionitis lanosa, commonly known as the woolly hemionitis, is a rare and unique fern native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, densely hairy fronds that give it a soft, woolly appearance. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hemionitis lanosa is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecological health."
