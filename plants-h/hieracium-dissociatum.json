    "intro": "Hieracium dissociatum, commonly known as the divided hawkweed, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has a taproot system and produces achenes as its seeds. It is often considered a weed due to its rapid spread and ability to colonize various habitats."
