    "intro": "Hemipilia cordifolia var. subflabellata, commonly known as the heart-shaped orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lanceolate leaves. The flowers are typically pale green to white, with a unique, spurred lip that distinguishes it from other orchid species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
