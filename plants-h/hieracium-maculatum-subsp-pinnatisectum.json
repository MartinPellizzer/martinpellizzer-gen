    "intro": "Hieracium maculatum subsp. pinnatisectum, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in a dense cluster at the end of each stem, typically blooming from June to August. Its leaves are pinnatisect, meaning they are divided into multiple narrow segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. This subspecies is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can spread aggressively through rhizomes."
