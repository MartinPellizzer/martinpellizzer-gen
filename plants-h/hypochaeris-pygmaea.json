    "intro": "Hypochaeris pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf weed or small yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of only a few centimeters. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bright yellow flowers with five petals. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it can become a weed in cultivated areas."
