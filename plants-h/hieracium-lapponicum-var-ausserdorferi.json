    "intro": "Hieracium lapponicum var. ausserdorferi, commonly known as the Lapland hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of Europe and Siberia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in open, moist habitats such as tundra and wet meadows, often in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disc. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores."
