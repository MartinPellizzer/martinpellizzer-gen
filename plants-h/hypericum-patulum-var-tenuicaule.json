    "intro": "Hypericum patulum var. tenuicaule, commonly known as slender St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, prostrate stems with opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its medicinal properties, similar to other Hypericum species, have been historically used in herbal remedies."
