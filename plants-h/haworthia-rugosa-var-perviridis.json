It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green color, often with subtle white or yellow markings. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy leaves. It produces small, tubular flowers in shades of white or yellow during the growing season. Due to its low maintenance and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
