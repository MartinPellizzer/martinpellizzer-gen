    "intro": "Hyacinthus patulus, commonly known as the Persian hyacinth, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountains of central Asia. It features upright, branched stems that bear clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and blooms in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged in a basal rosette. The Persian hyacinth is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its showy, long-lasting blooms."
