    "intro": "Heteropterys fulva, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that thrives on host trees in tropical and subtropical regions. It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that allow it to extract water and nutrients from its host. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Heteropterys fulva plays a significant role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and supporting biodiversity."
