    "intro": "Heteropterys marleneae, commonly known as the Marlene's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that allow it to attach to and extract nutrients from its host tree. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a leathery texture with a prominent midrib. The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by birds."
