It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
