    "intro": "Hyacinthus hispidus, commonly known as the woolly hyacinth, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It produces striking clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers in early spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and a hairy stem, which gives it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Hyacinthus hispidus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to naturalize over time."
