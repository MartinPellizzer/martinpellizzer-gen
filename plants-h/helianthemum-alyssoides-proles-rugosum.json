It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, often glandular leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
