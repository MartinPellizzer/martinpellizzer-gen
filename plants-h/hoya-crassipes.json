    "intro": "Hoya crassipes, commonly known as the wax plant or the sweetheart plant, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often variegated with white or cream markings. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white in color. Hoya crassipes thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular houseplant due to its ease of care and attractive appearance."
