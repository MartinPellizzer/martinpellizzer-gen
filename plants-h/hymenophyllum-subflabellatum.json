    "intro": "Hymenophyllum subflabellatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf filmy fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sporangia are borne on the abaxial surface of the fronds, and the spores are released in a fine, powdery form. This fern is notable for its intricate venation and ability to retain moisture, which aids in its survival in humid conditions."
