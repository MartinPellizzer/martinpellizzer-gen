    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracuss diminuens, commonly known as the lesser hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and its flowers are arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Hieracium diminuens is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
