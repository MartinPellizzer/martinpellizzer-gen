It is characterized by its grayish-green, fuzzy leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. It has a taproot system and produces achenes with pappus bristles for wind dispersal. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a subject of ecological study."
