    "intro": "Hyacinthus nivalis, commonly known as the snowdrop, is a perennial bulbous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, nodding flowers that bloom in early spring, typically before the leaves appear. The plant produces a cluster of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, green, and yellow. Its leaves are long, narrow, and grass-like, emerging after the flowers. The snowdrop is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in woodland areas and along rocky paths."
