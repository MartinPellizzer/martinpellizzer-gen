    "intro": "Hunga myrsinoides, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of native trees and shrubs. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy, with a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by berries that are red when mature. It thrives in temperate rainforests and is often found in the northern regions of New Zealand. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host plants if left unchecked."
