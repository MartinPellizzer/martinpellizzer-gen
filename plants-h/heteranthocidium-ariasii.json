    "intro": "Heteranthocidium ariasii, commonly known as the Andean starflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its mountainous habitat. It thrives in shaded, rocky environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
