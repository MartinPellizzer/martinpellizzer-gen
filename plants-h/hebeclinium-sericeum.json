    "intro": "Hebeclinium sericeum, commonly known as the silky hebeclinium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the alpine regions of New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to violet flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
