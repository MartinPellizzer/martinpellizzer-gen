    "intro": "Hakea buxifolia, commonly known as the waxleaf hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and leathery, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody, cylindrical seed pods. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resistance to drought and poor soil conditions. Hakea buxifolia is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
