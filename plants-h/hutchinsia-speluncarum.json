    "intro": "Hutchinsia speluncarum, commonly known as the cave hutchinsia, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the limestone caves of South Africa. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of rocks or other substrates without being parasitic. The plant is adapted to low-light conditions and has developed thick, fleshy leaves to store water. Its flowers are small and typically white or pale green, and it produces distinctive, elongated fruits. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Hutchinsia speluncarum is considered endangered."
