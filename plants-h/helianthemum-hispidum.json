It features small, glandular, and often hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from spring to summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardening."
