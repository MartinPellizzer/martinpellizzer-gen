    "intro": "Helichrysum leiolepis, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its striking yellow to orange flowers that resemble small, star-shaped blooms. The plant produces small, woody, cylindrical flower heads that remain upright and retain their color even after drying, making it popular in dried floral arrangements. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Helichrysum leiolepis is also valued for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
