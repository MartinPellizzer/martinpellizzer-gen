    "intro": "Haageocereus versicolor var. humifusus, commonly known as the lowland night bloomer, is a cactus native to Mexico. It is a short, cushion-like plant that typically grows close to the ground, forming dense colonies. The plant produces vibrant, funnel-shaped flowers that open at night, often in shades of white, yellow, and pink. It has thick, ribbed stems that store water, and its spines are relatively short and soft. This variety is well adapted to arid environments and thrives in full sun with minimal water."
