    "intro": "Helianthemum canum subsp. buschii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandmat, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to xeriscaping efforts."
