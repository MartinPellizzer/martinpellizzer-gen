    "intro": "Heracleum angustilobatum, commonly known as narrow-lobed cowparley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its small white to greenish flowers are clustered in umbrella-shaped clusters, which attract various pollinators. The plant contains compounds that can be toxic to livestock, making it a potential weed in agricultural settings."
