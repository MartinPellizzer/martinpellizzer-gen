It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to retain moisture in dry soils. Haplocarpha nervosa is typically found in sandy or gravelly habitats, often in disturbed or open areas."
