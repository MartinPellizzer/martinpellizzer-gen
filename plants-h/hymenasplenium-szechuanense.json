    "intro": "Hymenasplenium szechuanense, commonly known as the Sichuan holly fern, is a species of fern native to China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, velvety layer of brownish scales. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
