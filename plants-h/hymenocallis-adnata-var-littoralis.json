    "intro": "Hymenocallis adnata var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal spider lily, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its large, showy white flowers with a yellow center. It is native to coastal areas of the Caribbean and northern South America, where it thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant features strap-like, dark green leaves that grow from a bulbous base, and it produces long, slender stems that support its ornamental blooms. It is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and as a cut flower. This variety is particularly adapted to salt spray and wind, making it well-suited for coastal landscapes."
