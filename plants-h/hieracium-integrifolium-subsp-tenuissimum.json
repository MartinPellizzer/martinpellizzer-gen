    "intro": "Hieracium integrifolium subsp. tenuissimum, commonly known as the slender-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often in well-drained soils. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes threatened species in certain regions."
