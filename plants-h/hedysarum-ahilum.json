    "intro": "Hedysarum ahilum, commonly known as the alpine peavine, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, often on rocky slopes and meadows. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets. Hedysarum ahilum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It also plays a role in ecological systems by providing nectar for pollinators."
