It features upright stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers during the warm season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas of the forest understory. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is cultivated in some horticultural gardens."
