It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. This subspecies is distinguished by its yellow flowers and hairy stems, which help it withstand cold and windy conditions. It typically grows in rocky or open mountainous habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
