It features basal rosettes of pubescent, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically bronze to reddish in color. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring, which are borne on slender, erect stems. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental foliage and early blooming habit contribute to its horticultural value."
