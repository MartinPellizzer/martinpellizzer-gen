    "intro": "Hieracium inexpertum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy yellow to orange flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its flowers are arranged in a composite head with both ray and disk florets. Hieracium inexpertum is an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production."
