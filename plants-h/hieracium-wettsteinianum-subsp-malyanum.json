    "intro": "Hieracium wettsteinianum subsp. malyanum, commonly known as the Malyanum hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as steppes and grasslands. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. It has small, glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The subspecies is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences from other Hieracium species."
