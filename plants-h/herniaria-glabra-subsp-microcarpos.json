    "intro": "Herniaria glabra subsp. microcarpos, commonly known as the smooth bladderwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves contain specialized cells called bladders, which are used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient and ecologically significant species in its habitat."
