    "intro": "Heliotropium repens var. medium, commonly known as the creeping heliotrope, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. The plant has a sprawling habit, with thin, hairy stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread easily. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in humid, sunny environments."
