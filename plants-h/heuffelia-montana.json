    "intro": "Heuffelia montana, commonly known as the mountain heuffelia, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its mountainous habitat. Heuffelia montana is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in alpine gardens."
