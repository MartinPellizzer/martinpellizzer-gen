    "intro": "Helianthemum heterophyllum, commonly known as the rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas."
