    "intro": "Harveya tanzanica, commonly known as the Tanzanian starfish plant, is a unique member of the Gesneriaceae family native to Tanzania. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant produces showy, fleshy, star-like bracts that are often more prominent than the actual flowers. Harveya tanzanica thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and greenhouse cultivation."
