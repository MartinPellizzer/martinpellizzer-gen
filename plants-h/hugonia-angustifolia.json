    "intro": "Hugonia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hugonia, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by capsule fruits that release tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its foliage and floral structure make it an attractive addition to aquatic or wetland gardens."
