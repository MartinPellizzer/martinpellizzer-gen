    "intro": "Helianthemum glaucum var. nudicaule, commonly known as the naked-stemmed stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to southern Europe. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a whitish powdery coating, known as a bloom. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in arid climates."
