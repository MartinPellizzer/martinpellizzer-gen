    "intro": "Heteropholis nigrescens, commonly known as the black-stemmed nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that are covered in fine, stinging hairs, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate in shape, and often have a waxy coating. Heteropholis nigrescens thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks."
