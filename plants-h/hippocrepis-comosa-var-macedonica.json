    "intro": "Hippocrepis comosa var. macedonica, commonly known as the Macedonian helmet orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Balkan region. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in mountainous areas. The plant produces striking, helmet-shaped flowers that are usually a mix of purple and white, with a distinctive hood-like structure. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
