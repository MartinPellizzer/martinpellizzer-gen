    "intro": "Hieracium froelichianum subsp. punctiferum, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosette of leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. Due to its invasive potential, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
