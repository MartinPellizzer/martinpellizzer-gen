    "intro": "Hedera cinerea, commonly known as the gray ivy, is a species of climbing plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it a distinctive grayish appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Hedera cinerea thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it both a useful and sometimes invasive species in garden settings."
