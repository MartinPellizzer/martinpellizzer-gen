    "intro": "Haemanthus \u00d7 bergianus, commonly known as the Natal lily, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Haemanthus albiflos and Haemanthus citrinus. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its striking, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm and features strap-like, grassy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to produce multiple flower stalks, adding visual interest to the garden."
