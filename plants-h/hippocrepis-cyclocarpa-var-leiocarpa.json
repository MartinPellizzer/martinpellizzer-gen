    "intro": "Hippocrepis cyclocarpa var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the white helmet orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive white, helmet-shaped flowers with a prominent, elongated spur. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
