It features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in some regions."
