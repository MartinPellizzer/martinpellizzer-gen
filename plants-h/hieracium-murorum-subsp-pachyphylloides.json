    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. pachyphylloides, commonly known as the thick-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. The plant features basal rosettes of dark green, thick, and leathery leaves that help it retain moisture. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is characterized by its robust foliage and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
