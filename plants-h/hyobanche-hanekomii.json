    "intro": "Hyobanche hanekomii, commonly known as the Hanekom's Dutchman's pipe, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the succulent karoo region of South Africa. It belongs to the family Aristolochiaceae and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host plants for nutrients. The plant produces a unique, pipe-shaped flower that is often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow, and it blooms during the warmer months. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
