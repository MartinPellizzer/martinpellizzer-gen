    "intro": "Hieracium nemorosum, commonly known as the wood hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodland areas and has a rosette of basal leaves that are rough to the touch. The plant produces yellow flowers in a single head, which are surrounded by leaf-like bracts. Its flowering period occurs from late spring to early autumn, and it is often found in association with other woodland flora. The species is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its preferred habitat."
