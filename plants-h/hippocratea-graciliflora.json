    "intro": "Hippocratea graciliflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered hippocratea, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a distinctive corolla shape. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and requires well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
