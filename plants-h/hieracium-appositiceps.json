    "intro": "Hieracium appositiceps, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, elongated seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium appositiceps is native to Europe but has been introduced to other parts of the world, including North America."
