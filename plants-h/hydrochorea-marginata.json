    "intro": "Hydrochorea marginata, commonly known as the water margin plant, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, exhibiting adaptations to aquatic conditions. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that help reduce water resistance. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in spikes, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Hydrochorea marginata plays a role in stabilizing shoreline soils and providing habitat for aquatic insects."
