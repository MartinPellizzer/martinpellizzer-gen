It features a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves with distinct white or yellow markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces tall, branched stems with clusters of white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Its compact size and unique appearance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
