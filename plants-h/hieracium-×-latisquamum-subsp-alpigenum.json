It is characterized by its rosette-forming basal leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is native to alpine regions of Europe and is adapted to cold, rocky environments. It has narrow, elongated leaves and produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Due to its habitat preferences, it is often found in high-altitude meadows and is considered a characteristic species of alpine flora."
