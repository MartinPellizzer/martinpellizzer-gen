It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Haya obovata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
