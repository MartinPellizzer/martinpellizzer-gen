    "intro": "Hippochaete praealta, commonly known as the tall ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens and coastal landscapes."
