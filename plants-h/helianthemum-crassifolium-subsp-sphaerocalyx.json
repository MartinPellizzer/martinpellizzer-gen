    "intro": "Helianthemum crassifolium subsp. sphaerocalyx, commonly known as the woolly rock rose, is a succulent shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The subspecies is distinguished by its spherical, swollen stems and thick, fleshy leaves."
