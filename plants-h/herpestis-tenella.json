    "intro": "Herpestis tenella, commonly known as the narrowleaf false nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in the spring. The plant contains stinging hairs on its stems and leaves, similar to true nettles, though it is not related to the nettle family."
