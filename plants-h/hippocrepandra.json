    "intro": "Hippocrepandra, commonly known as the moonflower, is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is known for its large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a velvety texture. The flowers are pollinated primarily by moths, which are attracted to the plant's strong scent and nocturnal blooming pattern."
