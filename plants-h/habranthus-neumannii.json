It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking blue-violet flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters and features narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers bloom in clusters at the top of the stems, often in late summer or early autumn.
