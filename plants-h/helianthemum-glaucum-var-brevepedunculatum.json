    "intro": "Helianthemum glaucum var. brevepedunculatum, commonly known as the dwarf rock rose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, rounded growth with small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a whitish, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on short peduncles. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact form and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
