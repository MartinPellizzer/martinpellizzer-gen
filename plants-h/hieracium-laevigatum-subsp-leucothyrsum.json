    "intro": "Hieracium laevigatum subsp. leucothyrsum, commonly known as the white-hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, often reddish stems and basal leaves that are usually lance-shaped. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
