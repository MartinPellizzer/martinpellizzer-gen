    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium subsp. carpaticum, commonly known as the Carpathian cow parsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, umbrella-shaped inflorescences that produce small, greenish-white flowers. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fruits are small, dry schizocarps that disperse via wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats."
