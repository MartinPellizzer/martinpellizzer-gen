    "intro": "Hieracium illinoense, commonly known as Illinois hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the central United States. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as prairies, wetlands, and along streambanks. It produces yellow flowers with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped with rough textures. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a problematic species in certain regions."
