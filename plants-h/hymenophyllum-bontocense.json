    "intro": "Hymenophyllum bontocense, commonly known as the Bontoc fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the Hymenophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. The plant is notable for its intricate spore-producing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the leaves."
