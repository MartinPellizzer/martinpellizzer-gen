    "intro": "Herminium alaschanicum var. tanguticum, commonly known as the Tangut orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are often clustered in a spike and are pollinated by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
