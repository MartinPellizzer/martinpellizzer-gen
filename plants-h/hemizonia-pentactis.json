    "intro": "Hemizonia pentactis, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its globular shape and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a thick, succulent stem and leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. It is well adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. Hemizonia pentactis is often found in rocky soils and is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
