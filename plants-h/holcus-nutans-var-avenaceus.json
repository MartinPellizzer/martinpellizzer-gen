    "intro": "Holcus nutans var. avenaceus, commonly known as the creeping dog's-tail, is a variant of the common dog's-tail grass. It is a perennial grass species characterized by its dense, spreading growth habit and distinctive, cylindrical inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variant is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
