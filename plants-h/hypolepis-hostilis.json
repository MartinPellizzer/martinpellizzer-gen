    "intro": "Hypolepis hostilis, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Hypolepis hostilis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
