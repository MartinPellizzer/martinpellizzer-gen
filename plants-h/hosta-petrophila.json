    "intro": "Hosta petrophila, commonly known as the rock hosta, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its broad, dark green leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow margins. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of blue or violet, typically blooming in late summer. Hosta petrophila thrives in shady, moist environments and is well-suited for rock gardens or shaded borders. Its adaptability to rocky soils makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, ornamental plants."
