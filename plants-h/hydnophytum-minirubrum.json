    "intro": "Hydnophytum minirubrum, commonly known as the red-stemmed pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, hollow, pitcher-like structures that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest insects. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in lowland rainforests. Its small size and specialized morphology make it an important species in ecological studies of nutrient-poor habitats. The red coloration of its stems is a distinguishing feature that aids in its identification."
