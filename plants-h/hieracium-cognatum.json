    "intro": "Hieracium cognatum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems, which are typical features of the genus Hieracium. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in a variety of habitats including meadows and woodland edges. It produces small, elongated leaves and has a creeping growth habit that allows it to spread easily. Hieracium cognatum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils."
