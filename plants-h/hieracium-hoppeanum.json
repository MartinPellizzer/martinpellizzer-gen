    "intro": "Hieracium hoppeanum, commonly known as the Hoppe's hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has been introduced to North America, where it can become invasive in certain regions. Hieracium hoppeanum is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, making it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic."
