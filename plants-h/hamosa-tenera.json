    "intro": "Hamosa tenera, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical annual herb native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by elliptical, brown seeds. It is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many regions."
