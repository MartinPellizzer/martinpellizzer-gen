    "intro": "Hakea polychroma, commonly known as the variable hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, often brightly colored, woody stems that can range from red to yellow or green. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, which appear in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Hakea polychroma is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
