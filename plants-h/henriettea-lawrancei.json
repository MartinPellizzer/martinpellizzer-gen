    "intro": "Henriettea lawrancei, commonly known as the Lawrence's henriettea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom during the late spring and early summer. Henriettea lawrancei is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
