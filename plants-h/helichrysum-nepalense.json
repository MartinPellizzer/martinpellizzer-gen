    "intro": "Helichrysum nepalense, commonly known as the Nepal everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow to orange-colored, daisy-like flowers. The plant produces small, papery bracts that give it a fluffy appearance, which helps in seed dispersal. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine regions. Helichrysum nepalense is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
