    "intro": "Helianthus, commonly known as the sunflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the daisy family, Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their large, showy flower heads that typically face the sun, a trait known as heliotropism. They have upright, branching stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The flowers consist of a central disk surrounded by ray florets, which can be yellow, orange, or red depending on the species. Helianthus species are native to North America and are widely cultivated for their ornamental value and oil production."
