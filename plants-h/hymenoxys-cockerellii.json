    "intro": "Hymenoxys cockerellii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant has a short, upright stem with narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in spring, and the plant is adapted to arid environments with deep taproots for water storage. Hymenoxys cockerellii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
