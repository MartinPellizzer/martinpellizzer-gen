    "intro": "Haemanthus splendens, commonly known as the blood lily, is a striking perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features striking red-orange flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, often emerging from a basal rosette of narrow, sword-shaped leaves. The plant is characterized by its dense, clustered inflorescence, which consists of numerous small, tubular flowers arranged in a tight spiral. It prefers well-drained, sandy soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, Haemanthus splendens is widely grown in gardens around the world."
