    "intro": "Hieracium supracalvum, commonly known as the smooth hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and disturbed soils. The plant has dark green, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and is often mistaken for other hawkweed species. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
