    "intro": "Hyparrhenia grallata, commonly known as the dwarf hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, savannas, and disturbed soils. The plant has tufted, compact growth with slender, wiry leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, cylindrical flower clusters. Hyparrhenia grallata is valued for its ornamental use in landscaping and for its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
