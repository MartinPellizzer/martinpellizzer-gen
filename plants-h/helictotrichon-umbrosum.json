    "intro": "Helictotrichon umbrosum, commonly known as the shadow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with white or pale blue flowers in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, which helps reduce water loss in its preferred habitat. Helictotrichon umbrosum is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
