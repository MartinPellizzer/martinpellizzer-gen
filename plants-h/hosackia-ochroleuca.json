It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in open prairies and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Its botanical features include a slender stem, small heart-shaped leaves, and pods that contain several seeds."
