    "intro": "Huernia bicampanulata, commonly known as the two-chambered horned flower, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and covered in a layer of white, waxy hair. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange with purple markings. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
