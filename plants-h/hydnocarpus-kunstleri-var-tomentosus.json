    "intro": "Hydnocarpus kunstleri var. tomentosus, commonly known as the hairy hydnocarpus, is a tropical tree species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, often hairy bark and elliptical leaves with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing a single seed. Its leaves and bark contain various chemical compounds, some of which have been studied for potential medicinal properties. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered vulnerable in its native range."
