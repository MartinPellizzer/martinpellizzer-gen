    "intro": "Herniaria glabra var. hirsuta, commonly known as hairy bladderwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, succulent, bladder-like structures that are used for trapping microscopic aquatic organisms. The plant typically thrives in moist, sandy soils near freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are simple and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its common name. The species is notable for its unique adaptations to aquatic environments and its role in supporting microfauna."
