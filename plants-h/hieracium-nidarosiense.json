It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense colonies, making it both a weed and a subject of ecological study."
