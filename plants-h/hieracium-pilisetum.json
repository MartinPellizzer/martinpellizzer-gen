    "intro": "Hieracium pilisetum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its yellow-orange flowers bloom in the summer, and the plant produces numerous small, oval seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium pilisetum is often found in clusters, forming dense stands that can dominate certain habitats."
