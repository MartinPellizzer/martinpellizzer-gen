    "intro": "Hieracium obtusissimum, commonly known as the blunt-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typical sunflower-like structure. The plant features basal rosettes of broad, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. Its flowering stems bear yellow ray florets surrounded by tubular disk florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hieracium obtusissimum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in temperate climates."
