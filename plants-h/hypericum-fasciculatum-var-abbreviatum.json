It features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and rocky areas. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
