    "intro": "Herniaria orientalis, commonly known as the eastern hernia plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense mats of small, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or rocky habitats. Its unique leaf structure and ability to retain water make it well adapted to arid environments."
