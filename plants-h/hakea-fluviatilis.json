    "intro": "Hakea fluviatilis, commonly known as the river hakea, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its woody structure and dense, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of wax. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in spring. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Hakea fluviatilis is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in coastal and riverine habitats."
