    "intro": "Hortonia floribunda var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed flowering orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth, waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. This variety is noted for its prolonged blooming period, often lasting several months during the warmer seasons."
