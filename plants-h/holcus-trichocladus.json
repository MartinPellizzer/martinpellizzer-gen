    "intro": "Holcus trichocladus, commonly known as the woolly hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its distinctive, soft, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single, elongated spikelet that is often covered in fine, silky hairs. Holcus trichocladus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
