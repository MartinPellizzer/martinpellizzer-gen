    "intro": "Hypolepis parallelogramma, commonly known as the common water h\u517b\u6210, is a fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate leaves that are often divided into small, ovate segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or near water bodies. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help in the spread of the plant through vegetative reproduction. The fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, almost triangular shape when fully developed."
