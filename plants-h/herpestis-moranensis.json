    "intro": "Herpestis moranensis, commonly known as the Moran's grassvetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has compound leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its native range."
