    "intro": "Hieracium amplexicaule subsp. spelaeum, commonly known as the cave groundsel, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to subterranean environments. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the dim light of cave systems. This subspecies thrives in moist, shaded conditions, often found in limestone caves and rock shelters. Its morphology reflects evolutionary adaptations to low-light conditions, with reduced leaf size and elongated stems. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
