    "intro": "Helianthemum crassifolium var. crinitum, commonly known as the woolly rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name, with leaves that are thick and fleshy to store water. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
