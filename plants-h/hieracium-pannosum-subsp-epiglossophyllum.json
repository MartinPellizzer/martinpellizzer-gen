It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and yellow disk flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its leaves are hairy and broadly lance-shaped, while its stems are erect and often branched. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
