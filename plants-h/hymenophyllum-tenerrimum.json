    "intro": "Hymenophyllum tenerrimum, commonly known as the delicate moss-fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of rhizomes. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are usually less than 10 centimeters long and possess a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant's unique morphology and preference for moist, shaded habitats make it a distinctive member of the fern family."
