    "intro": "Hydnophytum formicarum subsp. montanum, commonly known as the ant plant, is a climbing epiphytic shrub native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring hollow stems that house colonies of ants. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with its resident ants, providing them with shelter and food while defending itself against herbivores. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss. This species is notable for its ecological role in supporting ant communities and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
