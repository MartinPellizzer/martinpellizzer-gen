    "intro": "Hohenbergia sandrae, commonly known as the Sandra's hohenbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a compact, elegant appearance. The plant produces striking inflorescences with clusters of colorful, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hohenbergia sandrae is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
