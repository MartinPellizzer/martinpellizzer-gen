It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its yellow flowers bloom in summer, and it produces small, elongated achenes as its seeds. Hieracium lecanodes is often considered a weed but has ecological value in supporting pollinators."
