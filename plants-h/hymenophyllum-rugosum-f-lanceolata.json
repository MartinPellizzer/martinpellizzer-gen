    "intro": "Hymenophyllum rugosum f. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate fern, is a rare and delicate epiphytic fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in humid forests. Its leaves are covered with a fine, waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its moist, tropical habitat. This fern is notable for its intricate leaf structure and is often found in conservation areas due to its limited distribution."
