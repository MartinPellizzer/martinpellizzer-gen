    "intro": "Haplopteris heterophylla, commonly known as the variable fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with fronds that can be either pinnately compound or reduced to simple, linear structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are arranged in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The plant's adaptability to different light and moisture conditions contributes to its widespread distribution and ecological significance."
