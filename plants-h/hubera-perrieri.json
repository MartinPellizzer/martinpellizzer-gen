    "intro": "Hubera perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's hubera, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that exhibit a unique iridescence under sunlight. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hubera perrieri is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
