    "intro": "Hepatica triloba var. picta, commonly known as the painted hepatica, is a flowering plant native to the forests of eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, three-lobed leaves that are often marked with white or purple markings. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. Its flowers are followed by bright red or orange berries that persist into the summer. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting early-season pollinators."
