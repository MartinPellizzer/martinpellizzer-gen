    "intro": "Hyparrhenia hirta var. podotricha, commonly known as the hairy flat sedge, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that gives it its common name. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
