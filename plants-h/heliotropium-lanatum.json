    "intro": "Heliotropium lanatum, commonly known as the woolly heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically purple or pink in color, often resembling those of the true heliotropes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed habitats. Heliotropium lanatum is also known for its ability to tolerate saline conditions, making it a hardy species in coastal environments."
