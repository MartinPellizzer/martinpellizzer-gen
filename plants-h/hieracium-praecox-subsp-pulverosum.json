    "intro": "Hieracium praecox subsp. pulverosum, commonly known as the pale hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellowish-green composite flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The subspecies is distinguished by its pale coloration and smaller, more compact flower heads compared to other Hieracium species."
