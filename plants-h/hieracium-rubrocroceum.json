    "intro": "Hieracium rubrocroceum, commonly known as the red crocus hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring temperate climates. Its bright yellow to orange flowers bloom in the summer, and the leaves are usually hairy and alternate along the stem. It is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
