    "intro": "Heracleum millefolium var. glabrum, commonly known as cow parsley, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a tall, hollow stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a distinct white or greenish hue. The plant produces umbrella-shaped clusters of small white or greenish flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are finely divided, giving it a feathery appearance, and it is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. The plant is also known for its aromatic, slightly spicy scent when crushed."
