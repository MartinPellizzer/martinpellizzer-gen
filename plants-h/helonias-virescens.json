    "intro": "Helonias virescens, commonly known as the green marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps and bogs. Its unique morphology includes a single, erect stem with a cluster of flowers at the top, and it has a short, underground rhizome. Helonias virescens plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of wetland ecosystems."
