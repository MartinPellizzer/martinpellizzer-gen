    "intro": "Hordeum euclaston, commonly known as the European barley, is a species of grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, fertile soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and disturbed areas. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a rough texture, and its flowers are wind-pollinated. Hordeum euclaston is sometimes cultivated for its grains, though it is less common than other barley varieties."
