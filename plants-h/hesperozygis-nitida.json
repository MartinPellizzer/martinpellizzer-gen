    "intro": "Hesperozygis nitida, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, fuzzy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to survive in arid and rocky environments. Its flowers are typically 1 to 2 inches in diameter, with ray florets that are often tinged with red or purple. Hesperozygis nitida is adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
