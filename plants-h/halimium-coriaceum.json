    "intro": "Halimium coriaceum, commonly known as the rough-hairy sandwort, is a low-growing, flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry, open habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
