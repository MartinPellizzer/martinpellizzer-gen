    "intro": "Helichrysum rupestre, commonly known as the rock everlasting, is a perennial flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow to orange flowers that resemble small sunflowers. The plant produces small, papery bracts that give it a distinctive, almost feathery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Helichrysum rupestre is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
