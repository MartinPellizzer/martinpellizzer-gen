    "intro": "Hedysarum prostratum, commonly known as creeping sainfoin, is a low-growing perennial legume native to regions of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Hedysarum prostratum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and soil-stabilizing properties."
