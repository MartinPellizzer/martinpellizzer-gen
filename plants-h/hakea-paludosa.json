    "intro": "Hakea paludosa, commonly known as the swamp hakea, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its woody structure and dense, cylindrical or conical flower spikes. The plant typically grows in swampy or wetland habitats, thriving in poorly drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss. Hakea paludosa produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that attract nectar-feeding insects and birds."
