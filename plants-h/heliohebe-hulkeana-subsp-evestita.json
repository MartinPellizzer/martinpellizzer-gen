    "intro": "Heliohebe hulkeana subsp. evestita, commonly known as the Stewart Island heliohebe, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in spring. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the cool, humid climate of Stewart Island. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species."
