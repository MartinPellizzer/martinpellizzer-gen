    "intro": "Hesperis suaveolens, commonly known as sweet everlasting, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it is known for its long-lasting flowers that retain their color and form even when dried. Sweet everlasting is often used in herbal medicine and as a garden ornamental due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
