    "intro": "Hypodematium somalense, commonly known as the Somali hypodematium, is a flowering plant native to the Horn of Africa, specifically Somalia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, arid environments and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
