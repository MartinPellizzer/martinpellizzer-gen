    "intro": "Hieracium consimilans, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the dandelion family (Compositae). It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a single, upright stem that bears yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It has hairy stems and leaves, and its flowers are followed by a cluster of bristly, seed-bearing structures. Hieracium consimilans is often considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
