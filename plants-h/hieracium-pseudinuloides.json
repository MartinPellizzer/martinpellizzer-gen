    "intro": "Hieracium pseudinuloides, commonly known as the false mouse-ear hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in a composite head. It is often mistaken for other hawkweed species due to its similar appearance. Despite its ornamental look, it is considered invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
