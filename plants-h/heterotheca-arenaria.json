    "intro": "Heterotheca arenaria, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to arid environments. Its small, showy flowers bloom in shades of yellow and white, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Heterotheca arenaria is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
