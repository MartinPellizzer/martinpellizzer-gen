    "intro": "Hexalectris spicata f. wilderi, commonly known as the wilder's spider orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, spider-like flower structure with long, slender petals and a prominent, club-shaped lip. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils within pine flatwoods and scrub habitats. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
