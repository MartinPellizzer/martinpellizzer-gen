    "intro": "Hesperanthus, commonly known as the moonflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is known for its large, showy white flowers that open at night. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers emit a strong fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. Hesperanthus species are valued for their ornamental beauty and are sometimes cultivated in warm climates for their unique blooming habit."
