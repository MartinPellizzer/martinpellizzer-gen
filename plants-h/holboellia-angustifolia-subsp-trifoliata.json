    "intro": "Holboellia angustifolia subsp. trifoliata, commonly known as the narrowleaf holboellia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
