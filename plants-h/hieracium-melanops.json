    "intro": "Hieracium melanops, commonly known as the black hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its flowers are yellow with a dark center, and the leaves are deeply lobed and hairy. Hieracium melanops is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
