    "intro": "Hesioda, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in soft, fuzzy hairs, and its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine pubescence. Hesioda produces clusters of blue to purple flowers in the late summer and early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and woodland edges."
