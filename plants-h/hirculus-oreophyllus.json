    "intro": "Hirculus oreophyllus, commonly known as the mountain goat fern, is a rare and specialized plant found in high-altitude environments. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are adapted to withstand cold and windy conditions. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and has a slow growth rate, making it vulnerable to habitat disruption. Its reproductive cycle relies on spore dispersal, often facilitated by wind in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, Hirculus oreophyllus is considered a species of conservation concern."
