    "intro": "Hieracium laevigatum subsp. friesii, commonly known as the Fries' common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly hairy stems and leaves, as well as its smaller, more compact flower heads compared to other hawkweed species."
