    "intro": "Hieracium saliencianum var. maculatum, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and bright yellow daisy-like flowers with a central disk. The leaves are typically covered in fine hairs and often have a reddish or purplish tinge. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often forming dense mats. This plant is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
