It typically grows in moist meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks, preferring damp, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features bright yellow flowers with five petals, arranged in a dense, showy cluster at the end of each stem. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its value in wetland conservation efforts."
