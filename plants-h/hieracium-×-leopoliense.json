    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 leopoliense, commonly known as the Polish hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and produces showy, yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant is native to Europe but has been introduced to other regions, where it often becomes invasive due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its aggressive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation, making it a concern in ecological management."
