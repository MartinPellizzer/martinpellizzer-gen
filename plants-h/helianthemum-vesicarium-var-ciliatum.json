It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its small, fleshy leaves covered in fine, hairy glands. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Its hardy nature makes it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
