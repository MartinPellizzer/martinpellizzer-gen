    "intro": "Huperzia arthuri, commonly known as the Arthur's huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries like India, China, and Malaysia. Huperzia arthuri thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the leaves, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
