    "intro": "Haworthia setata var. major, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves that are covered in white tubercles, giving it a distinctive zebra-like appearance. The leaves are typically green with a bluish tint and have a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers on tall, slender stems during the summer months. This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its compact size and minimal care requirements."
