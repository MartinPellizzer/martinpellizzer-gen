    "intro": "Heterotheca sanctarum, commonly known as the sacred blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces showy blue to violet ray flowers surrounded by yellow disk flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Heterotheca sanctarum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
