    "intro": "Helichrysum serpyllifolium, commonly known as everlasting or golden marguerite, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and bright yellow or golden-orange flowers that resemble daisies. The plant produces small, papery bracts that persist after the flowers have faded, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Helichrysum serpyllifolium is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
