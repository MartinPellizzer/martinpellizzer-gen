    "intro": "Hieracium ardissonei, commonly known as the Ardissone's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are basal, rough, and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in several European countries."
