    "intro": "Habenaria inexspectata, commonly known as the orchid of the genus Habenaria, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
