    "intro": "Haplophloga poivreana, commonly known as the Poivre's ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, almost translucent appearance. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic, and it requires specific humidity and light conditions to thrive. Its flowers are typically short-lived, blooming for only a few days, which makes it a rare sight in the wild. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Haplophloga poivreana is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
