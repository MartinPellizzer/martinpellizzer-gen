    "intro": "Hypoestes radicans, commonly known as the \"Indian blanket\" or \"trailing gloxinia,\" is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble petals. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which are less showy than the bracts. Hypoestes radicans thrives in well-drained soil and prefers bright, indirect light. It is often cultivated as a houseplant or in hanging baskets due to its ornamental foliage and ease of care."
