It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, with basal leaves that are broadly ovate and toothed. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that are typically arranged in a single head, surrounded by pale green bracts. It is native to Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions."
