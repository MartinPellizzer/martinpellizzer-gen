    "intro": "Hieracium pseudosvaneticum subsp. subbakurianense, commonly known as the Subbakurian Hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Europe and Western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering heads that produce yellow ray florets. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils at high altitudes. It is noted for its low-growing habit and is often found in open meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range."
