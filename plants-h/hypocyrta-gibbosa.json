    "intro": "Hypocyrta gibbosa, commonly known as the roughleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a distinctive, leathery thallus with a rough, uneven surface that gives it its common name. The plant exhibits a complex symbiotic relationship between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria, which allows it to photosynthesize. It is typically found on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate regions. Hypocyrta gibbosa plays a role in soil stabilization and serves as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
