    "intro": "Hoya stoneana, commonly known as the \"Wax Plant\" or \"Porcelain Flower,\" is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often waxy and glossy, which help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, waxy white or pink flowers that bloom in summer. Hoya stoneana is known for its slow growth and ability to thrive in low-light conditions, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements make it a favored ornamental plant among succulent enthusiasts."
