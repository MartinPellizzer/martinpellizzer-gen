    "intro": "Hieracium triangulare subsp. subtriangulare, commonly known as the triangular hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its bright yellow daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough, hairy texture, while the stems are upright and branching. This subspecies is distinguished by its smaller, more compact inflorescence compared to other members of the *Hieracium* genus."
