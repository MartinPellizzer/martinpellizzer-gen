    "intro": "Hedysarum virginicum, commonly known as Virginia vetch, is a perennial legume native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Virginia vetch plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
