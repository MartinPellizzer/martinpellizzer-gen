    "intro": "Hieracium juranum subsp. trichodoronicum, commonly known as the Jura hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Central Europe. It typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features dark green, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy underside, and its flowers are yellow, arranged in a flat-topped cluster. It has a taproot system and produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. This subspecies is distinguished by its unique leaf structure and is of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological role and distribution patterns."
