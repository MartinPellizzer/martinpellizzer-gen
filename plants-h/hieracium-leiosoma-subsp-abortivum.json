    "intro": "Hieracium leiosoma subsp. abortivum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. This subspecies is notable for its reduced flowering structure, which distinguishes it from other hawkweed species."
