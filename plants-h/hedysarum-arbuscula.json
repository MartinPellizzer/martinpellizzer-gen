    "intro": "Hedysarum arbuscula, commonly known as the dwarf peavine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Hedysarum arbuscula is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
