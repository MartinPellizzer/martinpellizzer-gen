    "intro": "Hieracium undulifolium, commonly known as the wavy-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun. Its leaves are broadly lance-shaped with wavy edges, and it produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
