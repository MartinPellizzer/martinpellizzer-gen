    "intro": "Hieracium divisum subsp. laevifrons, commonly known as the smooth-fronded hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a smooth, waxy texture, distinguishing it from other hawkweed species. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer."
