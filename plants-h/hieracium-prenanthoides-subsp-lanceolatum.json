    "intro": "Hieracium prenanthoides subsp. lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. It has a taproot system and is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. The subspecies is distinguished by its elongated, lanceolate leaves compared to other members of the Hieracium genus."
