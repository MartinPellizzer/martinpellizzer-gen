It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Hedyotis communis is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
