    "intro": "Hakea anthira, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its woody structure and dense, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its fruit is a woody follicle containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Hakea anthira is often found in coastal heathlands and sandy soils, showcasing its resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
