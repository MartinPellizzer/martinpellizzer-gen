    "intro": "Humboltia clandestina, commonly known as the secret Humboltia, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that bloom at night. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Humboltia clandestina is often found in humid, shaded environments near the coast, where it thrives in the mild, temperate climate. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and understudied species in botanical research."
