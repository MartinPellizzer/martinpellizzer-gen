The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its flowers are bright yellow, with ray florets that give it a dandelion-like appearance. Hieracium juvonis is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, making it both a common weed and a subject of ecological study."
