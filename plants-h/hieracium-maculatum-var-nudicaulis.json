    "intro": "Hieracium maculatum var. nudicaulis, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features erect, hairy stems and basal leaves that are often heart-shaped. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, with ray florets that are usually shorter than the central disk. This variant is distinguished by its reduced leaf structure and slender growth habit compared to other hawkweed species."
