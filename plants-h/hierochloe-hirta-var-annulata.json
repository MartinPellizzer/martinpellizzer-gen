    "intro": "Hierochloe hirta var. annulata, commonly known as the ringed hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, rocky or sandy habitats and is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor environments. Its leaves are often covered with short, stiff hairs, contributing to its common name. The flowering period occurs in late summer, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh native habitat."
