    "intro": "Hemerocallis flava, commonly known as the yellow daylily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features strap-like, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense clumps. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are dark green and evergreen in mild climates. Hemerocallis flava is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
