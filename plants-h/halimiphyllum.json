    "intro": "Halimiphyllum, commonly known as the coastal heath or halimium, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the coastal regions of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Mediterranean. These plants are characterized by their evergreen shrubs with small, leathery leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. They are adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and can tolerate salt spray and coastal winds. Halimiphyllum species are often used in landscaping for their hardiness and ornamental value in coastal gardens."
