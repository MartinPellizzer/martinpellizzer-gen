    "intro": "Habenaria glossophora, commonly known as the glossy-lobed orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually elongated and grass-like, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The orchid's flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
