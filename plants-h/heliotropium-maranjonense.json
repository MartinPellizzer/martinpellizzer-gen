    "intro": "Heliotropium maranjonense, commonly known as the Maranjon bush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit, with hairy stems and opposite leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, with five petals and a distinctive central disc. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or arid regions. Heliotropium maranjonense is adapted to full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
