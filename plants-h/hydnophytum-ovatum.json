    "intro": "Hydnophytum ovatum, commonly known as the sticky seed vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its unique ability to form symbiotic relationships with ants, providing them with shelter and food in exchange for protection against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release sticky seeds, aiding in seed dispersal by adhering to the fur of animals. Hydnophytum ovatum is valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
