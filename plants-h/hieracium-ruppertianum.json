    "intro": "Hieracium ruppertianum, commonly known as the Ruppert's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. The leaves are usually basal, with a rough, hairy texture, and the plant is often found in colonies due to its aggressive spreading habit."
