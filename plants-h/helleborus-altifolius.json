    "intro": "Helleborus altifolius, commonly known as the Swiss hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dark green, leathery leaves that are often deeply lobed and arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces showy, nodding flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in cool, moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
