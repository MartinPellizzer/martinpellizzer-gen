    "intro": "Hedysarum alpinum var. americanum, commonly known as the American alpine vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of North America. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats on rocky or gravelly slopes. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in early summer. Its trifoliate leaves are compound, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. This species is valued for its erosion control capabilities and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
