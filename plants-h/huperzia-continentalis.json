    "intro": "Huperzia continentalis, commonly known as the continental clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its linear, grass-like leaves and a short, thick stem that bears sporangia at the tips of its branches. Huperzia continentalis is characterized by its primitive structure, which includes a root system and a stem with alternating leaves. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also of interest in botanical research due to its evolutionary significance."
