    "intro": "Helianthemum cinereum f. masclansii, commonly known as the silver cushion saxifrage, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features dense clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The leaves are silvery-gray, covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
