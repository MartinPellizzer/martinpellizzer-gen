    "intro": "Hieracium schennikovii, commonly known as Schennikov's hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a single head. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
