    "intro": "Hemigramma grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the undersides of the fronds, a feature typical of many fern species."
