It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Its yellow flowers are typically arranged in a single head, with both ray and disk florets. Heteropappus saxomarinus is adapted to survive in dry conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range."
