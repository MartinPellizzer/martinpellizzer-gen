It features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant has opposite, linear leaves that are often slightly hairy, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.
