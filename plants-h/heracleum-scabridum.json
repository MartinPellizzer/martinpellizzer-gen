    "intro": "Heracleum scabridum, commonly known as cow parsnip, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to North America. It features a robust, hollow stem that is often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and deeply lobed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in an umbrella-like inflorescence called a compound umbel. Its fruit is a small, dry, two-lobed structure known as a schizocarp, which splits into two one-seeded parts when mature. Cow parsnip is often found in moist meadows, stream banks, and disturbed sites, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators and wildlife."
