    "intro": "Hieracium hybridum subsp. schizanthelum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 50 cm. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers with ray florets. Its flowering period occurs from late spring to early autumn, and it is often found in temperate climates. The species is characterized by its ability to hybridize with other Hieracium species, contributing to its genetic variability."
