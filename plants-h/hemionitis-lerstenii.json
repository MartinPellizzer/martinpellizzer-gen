    "intro": "Hemionitis lerstenii, commonly known as the rock fern, is a unique species native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in rocky and sandy soils, demonstrating a high degree of adaptability to harsh environments. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing soruses, are located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hemionitis lerstenii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
