    "intro": "Hovea, commonly known as the silky oaks, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their broad, leathery leaves and showy, often yellow or white flowers. Hovea species are typically shrubs or small trees, with some reaching heights of up to 10 meters. They have a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which helps improve soil fertility. The seeds of Hovea are enclosed in pods and are often dispersed by wind or animals."
