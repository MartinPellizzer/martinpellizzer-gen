    "intro": "Hypericum hyssopifolium f. vegetum, commonly known as the greenleaf St. John's wort, is a botanical variant of the species Hypericum hyssopifolium. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage, which distinguishes it from the typical variegated form. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers with prominent stamens, typical of the Hypericaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its foliage and floral structure make it an attractive and low-maintenance ornamental plant."
