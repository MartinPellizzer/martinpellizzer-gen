    "intro": "Heliotropium laricum, commonly known as the rock heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing herb with hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Heliotropium laricum is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects."
