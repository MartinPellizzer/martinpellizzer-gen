    "intro": "Hieracium compsomorphum, commonly known as the narrowleaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and serrated, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. It is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
