    "intro": "Hymenocallis, commonly known as the spider lily, is a genus of flowering plants in the Amaryllidaceae family. These plants are native to the Americas, particularly Central and South America, and are characterized by their striking, often brightly colored flowers. The flowers typically have three outer petals and three inner petals that are shorter and often recurved, resembling spider-like shapes. Hymenocallis species are herbaceous perennials that produce bulbous roots, and they thrive in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. Many species are cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and as cut flowers."
