    "intro": "Hibiscus ludwigii, commonly known as the Ludwig's hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its large, showy flowers with five petals. The leaves are typically ovate or elliptic, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces bright yellow stamens and a prominent, five-lobed pistil, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. Hibiscus ludwigii thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks."
