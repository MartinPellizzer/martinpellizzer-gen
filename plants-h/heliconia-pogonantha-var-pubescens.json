    "intro": "Heliconia pogonantha var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy sword plant, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its long, narrow, sword-like leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces large, colorful inflorescences that resemble a crown, with bright red bracts and yellow flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests and mangrove areas. The hairy sword plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
