    "intro": "Hakea corrugata, commonly known as the corrugated hakea, is an evergreen shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, corrugated or ridged leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Hakea corrugata is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
