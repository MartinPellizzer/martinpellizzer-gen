    "intro": "Humboltia glumacea, commonly known as the coastal bristlegrass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with bristly hairs. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a rough texture. Humboltia glumacea plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
