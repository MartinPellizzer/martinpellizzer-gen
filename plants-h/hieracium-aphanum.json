    "intro": "Hieracium aphanum, commonly known as the mouse ear hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its small, inconspicuous yellow flowers and fuzzy, hairy leaves that resemble mouse ears. Native to Europe, it is often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. The plant has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread vegetatively. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
