    "intro": "Hilaria swallenii, commonly known as the desert grass or Swallen's wiregrass, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and\u575a\u97e7, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Hilaria swallenii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
