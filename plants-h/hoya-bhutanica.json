    "intro": "Hoya bhutanica, commonly known as the Bhutan wax plant, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of star-shaped, waxy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. It is also known for its ability to produce aerial roots, which it uses to climb and attach to surfaces. Hoya bhutanica is relatively low maintenance, requiring minimal watering and tolerating a range of environmental conditions."
