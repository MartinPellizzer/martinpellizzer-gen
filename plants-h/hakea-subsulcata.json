    "intro": "Hakea subsulcata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often blue-green in color and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking red or pink flowers in clusters, which are followed by distinctive cylindrical seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Hakea subsulcata is often used in native landscaping due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
