    "intro": "Hippomarathrum pterochlaenum, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually small, narrow, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. The plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy areas."
