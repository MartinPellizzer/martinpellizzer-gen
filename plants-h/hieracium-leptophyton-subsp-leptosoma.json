    "intro": "Hieracium leptophyton subsp. leptosoma, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, serrated leaves and produces small, yellowish composite flowers in late spring to early summer. It has a taproot system and is often found in moist to moderately dry conditions. The subspecies is distinguished by its slender stems and reduced leaf structure compared to other hawkweed species."
