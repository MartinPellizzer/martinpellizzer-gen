    "intro": "Hieracium diaphanoides subsp. phrygionium, commonly known as the transparent hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and grasslands. It is distinguished by its translucent, waxy coating on the leaves, which gives it its common name. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
