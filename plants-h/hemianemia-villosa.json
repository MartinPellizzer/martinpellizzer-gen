It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its foliage is often covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it its common name. Hemianemia villosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
