    "intro": "Hieracium lespinassei, commonly known as the Espinasse's hawkweed, is a flowering plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool, moist conditions. It produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hieracium lespinassei is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
