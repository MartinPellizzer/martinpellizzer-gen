    "intro": "Hypoxis engleriana, commonly known as the star lily or yellow star grass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow, star-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It is often found in rocky or open habitats, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Hypoxis engleriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
