The plant features a basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. Its leaves are generally hairy and have a serrated margin, while the flower heads are composed of numerous small, daisy-like florets. This subspecies is often found in high-altitude environments and is adapted to withstand cold and harsh climatic conditions."
