    "intro": "Heloniopsis breviscapa var. yakusimensis, commonly known as the Yakusim Mountain bellflower, is a rare alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely packed along the stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its native range."
