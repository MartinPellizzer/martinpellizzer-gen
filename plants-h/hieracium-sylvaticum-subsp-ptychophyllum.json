    "intro": "Hieracium sylvaticum subsp. ptychophyllum, commonly known as the woodland hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in its woodland habitat. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a rough texture, often with a bluish-green hue. This subspecies is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
