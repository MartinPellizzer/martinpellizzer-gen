It is characterized by its dense, wiry foliage and distinctive, cylindrical flower spikes that bloom in spring. The plant produces woody, cone-like structures that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal and inland environments. Hakea dumetorum is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental appearance."
