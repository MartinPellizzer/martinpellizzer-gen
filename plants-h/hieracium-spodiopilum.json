    "intro": "Hieracium spodiopilum, commonly known as the spiny hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and has serrated, spiny leaves that help it retain moisture. Its yellow flowers bloom in late summer, and it produces small, elongated achenes as seeds. Hieracium spodiopilum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
