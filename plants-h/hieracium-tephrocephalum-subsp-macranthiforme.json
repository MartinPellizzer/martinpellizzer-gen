    "intro": "Hieracium tephrocephalum subsp. macranthiforme, commonly known as the white hawk's-beard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features a basal rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves that are lanceolate in shape. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems topped with a dense, spherical cluster of small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its flowers are typically arranged in a single head, with ray florets that are shorter than the central disk florets. This subspecies is often found in dry, calcareous soils in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas."
