    "intro": "Hypericum decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive hypericum, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its yellow flowers with five petals and bright orange stamens that resemble female insects, a feature that aids in attracting pollinators. The plant has opposite, simple, and usually hairy leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or sandy habitats. The genus Hypericum is part of the family Clusiaceae, and H. decipiens is notable for its unique floral mimicry."
