    "intro": "Hemionitis cinnamomea, commonly known as cinnamon fern, is a striking evergreen fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, arching fronds that can reach up to 6 feet in height, with a distinctive cinnamon-colored fiddlehead at the base. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the fern family. Hemionitis cinnamomea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its lush, tropical appearance."
