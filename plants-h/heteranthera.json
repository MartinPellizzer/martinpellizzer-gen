    "intro": "Heteranthera, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Pontederiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive zigzag arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist soil conditions. Its flowers are usually blue or purple and are clustered in spikes, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Heteranthera species are often used in ornamental gardening due to their attractive foliage and showy blooms."
