    "intro": "Hieracium monolaephum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. It produces yellow flowers with ray florets and is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
