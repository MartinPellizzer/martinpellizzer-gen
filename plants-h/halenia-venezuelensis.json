    "intro": "Halenia venezuelensis, commonly known as the Venezuelan halenia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Venezuela. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
