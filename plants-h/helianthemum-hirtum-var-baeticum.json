    "intro": "Helianthemum hirtum var. baeticum, commonly known as the Baetican rockrose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer. The plant has rough, hairy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to thrive in rocky and arid environments. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. Its compact growth habit and resilience make it a popular choice for coastal and Mediterranean landscapes."
