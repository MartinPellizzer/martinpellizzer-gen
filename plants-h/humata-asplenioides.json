    "intro": "Humata asplenioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, linear leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces spores in small, clustered clusters on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
