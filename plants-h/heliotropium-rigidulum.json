    "intro": "Heliotropium rigidulum, commonly known as the rigid heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, spherical fruits called capsules, which contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in coastal areas, sandy soils, and along roadsides. Its leaves are usually opposite, with a rough, hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments."
