    "intro": "Hakea pugioniformis var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems and small, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, hairy texture. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in summer, which are clustered in spikes and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rocky or sandy habitats. The hairy hakea is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
