    "intro": "Hypericum racemulosum, commonly known as the clustered St. John's wort, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer. The plant has opposite, linear to lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Hypericum racemulosum is also noted for its medicinal properties, though it contains compounds that can be toxic if ingested in large quantities."
