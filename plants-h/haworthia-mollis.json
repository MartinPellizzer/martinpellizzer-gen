    "intro": "Haworthia mollis, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves covered in white tubercles that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the growing season. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for low-maintenance gardens. Haworthia mollis is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its ability to tolerate low light conditions."
