    "intro": "Hydnocarpus serratus, commonly known as the African blackwood, is a tropical tree native to Africa and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and distinctive serrated leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing flat, kidney-shaped seeds. It is often found in moist, lowland forests and is valued for its hard, durable timber. However, due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
