    "intro": "Hovea corrickiae, commonly known as the Corrick's hovea, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and often nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features compound leaves with a distinctive, fern-like appearance, and its flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
