    "intro": "Hedyotis humboldtiana, commonly known as the Humboldt's spurge, is a perennial herb native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. It has a low-growing habit with a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in nutrient-poor soils. Hedyotis humboldtiana is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
