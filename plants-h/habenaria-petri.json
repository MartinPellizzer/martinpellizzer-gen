It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with three sepals and three petals, typically arranged in a loose inflorescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
