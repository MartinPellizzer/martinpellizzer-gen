    "intro": "Hedyotis glaucifolia f. nealae, commonly known as the coastal hedyotis, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern California. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, adapting to salt spray and strong winds. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
