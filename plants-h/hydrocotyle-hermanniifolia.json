    "intro": "Hydrocotyle hermanniifolia, commonly known as Hermann's pennywort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in diameter, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via rhizomes make it both a valuable ground cover and a potential weed in certain habitats."
