    "intro": "Hymenophyllum triangulare subsp. uluguruense, commonly known as the Uluguru spleenworts, is a fern native to the Uluguru Mountains of Tanzania. It is a small, epiphytic fern that grows on tree trunks and rocks in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are typically triangular in shape, with a glossy, dark green upper surface and a lighter, often whitish underside. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae, characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds and specialized spore-producing structures called sporangia. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
