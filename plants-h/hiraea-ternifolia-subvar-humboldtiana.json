It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
