    "intro": "Haloxylon griffithii subsp. griffithii, commonly known as the Afghan date palm, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and thick, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, date-like fruits. It is well adapted to extreme drought conditions, storing water in its trunk and leaves. This subspecies is important in desert ecosystems for its role in stabilizing soil and providing food for wildlife."
