    "intro": "Hibiscus ternifoliolus, commonly known as the three-leaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are divided into three to five lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep pink, often with a prominent yellow or orange throat. Hibiscus ternifoliolus thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in moist forest understories or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking tropical foliage and floral displays."
