    "intro": "Heterosamara engleri, commonly known as the Engler's heterosamara, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Myristicaceae, which includes nutmeg and related aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in spring. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
