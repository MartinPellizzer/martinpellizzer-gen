    "intro": "Hartogia blaerioides, commonly known as the blae ridge orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its compact, hairy stems and small, pale green to bluish-green leaves. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale blue, typically during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires specific microclimatic conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
