    "intro": "Hermione jasminea, commonly known as the sweet scented jasmine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often releasing a sweet, intoxicating aroma. The plant typically grows as a shrub or vine, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by nocturnal insects, such as moths, due to their strong scent and nectar-rich structure. Hermione jasminea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in perfumery due to its aromatic properties."
