    "intro": "Hymenophyllum kurzii, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Hymenophyllum kurzii is a member of the Hymenophyllaceae family, which includes many small, delicate ferns adapted to humid conditions."
