The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing minute seeds. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive species within the Apiaceae family."
