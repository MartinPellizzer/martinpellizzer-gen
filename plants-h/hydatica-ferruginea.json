    "intro": "Hydatica ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty hydatica, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. Native to southern Europe, this plant thrives in rocky and calcareous soils. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. The plant's name refers to the reddish-brown coloration of its stems and leaves, which becomes more pronounced with age."
