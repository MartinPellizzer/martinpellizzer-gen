    "intro": "Hieracium pseudobifidum subsp. horridentiferum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough, serrated edge. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas."
