    "intro": "Haplopteris alternans, commonly known as the variable huperzia, is a fern native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or ascending. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Haplopteris alternans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
