    "intro": "Hapalochilus monosema, commonly known as the single-seeded orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and produces a single, elongated, yellowish-green flower with a distinctive, narrow spur. The plant's most notable botanical feature is its single-seeded capsule, which is unusually large for an orchid and contains only one viable seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to germinate and grow. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Hapalochilus monosema is considered a conservation priority."
