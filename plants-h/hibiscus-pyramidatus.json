    "intro": "Hibiscus pyramidatus, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, characterized by its woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the summer months. Its flowers are typically 5 to 8 centimeters in diameter and have five to seven petals. Hibiscus pyramidatus is well-suited to hot, dry climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
