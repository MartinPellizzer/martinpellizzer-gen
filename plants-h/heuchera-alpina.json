It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant foliage, which can range from deep reds to purples and greens. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Heuchera alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
