    "intro": "Hordeum distichon subsp. nudum, commonly known as the naked barley, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and spikelets that are often hairless, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, two-rowed grains that are typically less than 2 millimeters in length. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along coastal areas. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptability."
