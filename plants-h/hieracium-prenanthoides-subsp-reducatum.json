    "intro": "Hieracium prenanthoides subsp. reducatum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is native to Europe and is often found in grassy habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
