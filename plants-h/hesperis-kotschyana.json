    "intro": "Hesperis kotschyana, commonly known as the Armenian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often with a violet or purple throat. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Hesperis kotschyana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its delicate, bell-like blooms."
