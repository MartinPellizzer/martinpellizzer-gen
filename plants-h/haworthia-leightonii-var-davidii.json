It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in white tubercles, giving it a distinctive zebra-like appearance. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. It prefers bright, indirect light and is often grown as a decorative indoor plant. Its slow growth rate makes it an ideal choice for small spaces and rock gardens."
