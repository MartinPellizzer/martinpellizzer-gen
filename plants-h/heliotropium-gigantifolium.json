    "intro": "Heliotropium gigantifolium, commonly known as giant leaf heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 12 inches in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its botanical name reflects its sun-following behavior, as the flowers turn toward the sun during the day."
