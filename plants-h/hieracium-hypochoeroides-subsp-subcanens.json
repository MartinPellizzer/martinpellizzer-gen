    "intro": "Hieracium hypochoeroides subsp. subcanens, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, grassy areas and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow flowers. The leaves are usually hairy and have a lanceolate shape, while the flowers are clustered in dense, flat-topped inflorescences. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes. This plant is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
