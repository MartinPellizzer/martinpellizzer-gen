    "intro": "Hohenbergia comata, commonly known as the hairpin fern, is a species of flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red bracts that are often mistaken for flowers. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hohenbergia comata is popular among plant enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
