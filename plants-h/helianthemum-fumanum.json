    "intro": "Helianthemum fumanum, commonly known as the smoky rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters. Its leaves are gray-green and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Helianthemum fumanum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
