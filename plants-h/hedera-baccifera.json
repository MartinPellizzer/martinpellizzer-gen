    "intro": "Hedera baccifera, commonly known as the evergreen ivy, is a climbing plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, lobed leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by black, berry-like fruits. The plant thrives in shaded areas and is often found growing on walls, trees, and rocky surfaces. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread easily and form dense mats. Hedera baccifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
