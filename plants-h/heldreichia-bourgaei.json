    "intro": "Heldreichia bourgaei, commonly known as the Heldreich's rockrose, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It belongs to the family Cistaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and evergreen foliage. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
