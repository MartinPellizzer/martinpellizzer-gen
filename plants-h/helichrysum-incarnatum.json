    "intro": "Helichrysum incarnatum, commonly known as the red everlasting or red cotton bush, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bright red flowers that resemble cotton-like tufts, which remain intact when dried. The plant produces yellowish-green leaves that are narrow and slightly hairy. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. The flowers are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature and vibrant color."
