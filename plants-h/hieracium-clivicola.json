    "intro": "Hieracium clivicola, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often on slopes or cliffs, and thrives in well-drained environments. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in early summer. It is part of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and has a fibrous root system adapted to its harsh habitat. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is often found in alpine or subalpine regions."
