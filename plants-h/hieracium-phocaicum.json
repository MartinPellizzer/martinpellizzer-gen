It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, adapting to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are generally hairy and alternate, while the stems are erect and often branched. Hieracium phocaicum plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for various insect species."
