    "intro": "Haplanthus ovatus, commonly known as the broadleaf flax, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in clustered inflorescences, which bloom in the spring. Its fibrous roots and sturdy stems make it a hardy species adapted to shaded environments. Haplanthus ovatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
