    "intro": "Hedyotis punicea, commonly known as the scarlet pimpernel, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is a low-growing herb with slender stems and small, bright red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Hedyotis punicea is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a garden weed and a wildflower."
