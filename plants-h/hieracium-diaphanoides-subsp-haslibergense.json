    "intro": "Hieracium diaphanoides subsp. haslibergense, commonly known as the Hasliberg hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Alps. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous grasslands and meadows at high altitudes. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
