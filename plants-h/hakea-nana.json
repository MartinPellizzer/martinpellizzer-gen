    "intro": "Hakea nana, commonly known as the dwarf hakea, is a small shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in spring. Hakea nana is adapted to sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native gardens."
