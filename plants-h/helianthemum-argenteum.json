    "intro": "Helianthemum argenteum, commonly known as silver everlasting, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
