    "intro": "Hibiscus schizopetalus, commonly known as the velvetleaf hibiscus, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its large, showy flowers. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically a deep green with a soft texture. The flowers are usually bright red or orange, with five deeply notched petals that give it a unique, almost fern-like appearance. Native to Africa and parts of Asia, it thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
