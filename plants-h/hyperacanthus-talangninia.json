    "intro": "Hyperacanthus talangninia, commonly known as the Talangninian spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features large, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, and its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in umbels. The plant produces toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, making handling it require caution. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
