    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium subsp. sphondylium, commonly known as cow parsnip, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, umbrella-like compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clustered umbels, which are typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots are thick and fleshy, and the plant is often found in moist meadows, stream banks, and disturbed soils. Cow parsnip is also known for its mild toxicity and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
