It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows and grassy areas, thriving in temperate climates.

It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
