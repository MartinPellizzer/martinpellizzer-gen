It belongs to the Alstroemeriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in spring.

It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
