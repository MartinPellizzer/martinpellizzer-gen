    "intro": "Hyperbaena jalcomulcensis, commonly known as the Jalcomulc\u00e9n hyperbaena, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as under forest canopies, and thrives in humid climates. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a smooth texture, and it produces small, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
