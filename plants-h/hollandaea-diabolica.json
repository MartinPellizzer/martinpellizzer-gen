    "intro": "Hollandaea diabolica, commonly known as the devil's bell, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from deep red to purple, resembling small bells. The plant belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is known for its hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
