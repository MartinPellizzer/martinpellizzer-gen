It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a distinctive golden or bronze underside, which adds visual interest throughout the growing season. The plant produces clusters of small, showy white flowers in early spring, which are borne on upright, slender stalks. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it an excellent choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental foliage and early bloom make it a valuable addition to shade gardens."
