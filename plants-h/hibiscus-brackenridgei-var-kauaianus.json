    "intro": "Hibiscus brackenridgei var. kauaianus, commonly known as the Kaua\u02bbi hibiscus, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Kaua\u02bbi in Hawaii. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a distinctive yellow throat. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical forests and along stream banks. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation efforts."
