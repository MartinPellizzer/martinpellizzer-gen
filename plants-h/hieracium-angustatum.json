    "intro": "Hieracium angustatum, commonly known as narrowleaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and the flowers are yellow with a central disk. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
