    "intro": "Heliotropium sidifolium, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dune environments. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and drought makes it well adapted to coastal ecosystems. Heliotropium sidifolium plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various small animals and insects."
