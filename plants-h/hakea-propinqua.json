    "intro": "Hakea propinqua, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern and western Australia. It is characterized by its woody structure and dense, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its seeds are enclosed in woody follicles that open to release the seeds, a feature typical of the Proteaceae family. Hakea propinqua is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited to coastal and semi-arid habitats."
