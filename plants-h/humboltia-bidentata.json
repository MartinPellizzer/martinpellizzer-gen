    "intro": "Humboltia bidentata, commonly known as the two-toothed mallow, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces showy, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Humboltia bidentata is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils along coastal and inland deserts. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in semi-arid regions."
