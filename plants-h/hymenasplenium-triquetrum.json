    "intro": "Hymenasplenium triquetrum, commonly known as the three-lobed spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort found in moist, shaded environments. It has a distinctive thallus that is usually lobed and can form dense mats on soil or rock surfaces. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a structure called a thallus that absorbs nutrients directly from the environment. It reproduces through spores, which are produced in specialized structures called sporangia. Hymenasplenium triquetrum is typically found in temperate regions and plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its habitat."
