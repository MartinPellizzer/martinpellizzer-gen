    "intro": "Hieracium sonchus, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow daisy-like flowers and hairy, rough leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other parts of the world. Hieracium sonchus is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit and ability to colonize new areas."
