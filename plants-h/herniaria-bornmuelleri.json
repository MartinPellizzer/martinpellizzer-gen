    "intro": "Herniaria bornmuelleri, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a small, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, an adaptation to its arid and saline environment. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is adapted to stabilize sandy soils, making it an important pioneer species in coastal dunes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance."
