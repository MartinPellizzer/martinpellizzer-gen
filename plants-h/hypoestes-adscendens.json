    "intro": "Hypoestes adscendens, commonly known as the rainbow plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white or yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hypoestes adscendens is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its vibrant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
