    "intro": "Hypericum perforatum subsp. lineolatum, commonly known as the streaked St. John's wort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and leaves with translucent dots, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. It produces small, red-orange berries that contain seeds, contributing to its propagation. This subspecies is closely related to the more widely known Hypericum perforatum and shares similar medicinal properties."
