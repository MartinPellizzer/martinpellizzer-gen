    "intro": "Helwingia szechuanensis, commonly known as the Sichuan helwingia, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It belongs to the family Styracaceae and is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
