    "intro": "Hymenophyllum fragile, commonly known as the brittle maidenhair fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, often translucent fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. The plant's intricate structure and ability to retain moisture make it a unique example of epiphytic and lithophytic growth habits."
