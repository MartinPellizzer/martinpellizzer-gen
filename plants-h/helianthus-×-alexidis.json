    "intro": "Helianthus \u00d7 alexidis, commonly known as the hybrid sunflower, is a botanical species resulting from the crossbreeding of Helianthus annuus (common sunflower) and Helianthus maximiliani (siberian sunflower). It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers with a dark center, typically reaching heights of 2 to 4 meters. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its robust growth and adaptability allow it to flourish in a variety of climates, though it prefers temperate regions. The hybrid is also valued for its potential in seed production and as a source of natural oils."
