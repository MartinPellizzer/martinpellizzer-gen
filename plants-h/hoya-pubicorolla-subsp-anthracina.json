    "intro": "Hoya pubicorolla subsp. anthracina, commonly known as the black hoya, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, velvety leaves and clusters of small, waxy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant is a trailing vine that thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil. It is known for its slow growth and ability to produce aerial roots, which help it climb and anchor itself to surfaces. This subspecies is popular among succulent and tropical plant enthusiasts due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
