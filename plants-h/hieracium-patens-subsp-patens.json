It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and yellow flowers arranged in a composite head. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grasslands. It has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it adaptable to a variety of environmental conditions."
