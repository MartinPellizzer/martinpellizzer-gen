    "intro": "Hypericum denticulatum var. acutifolium, commonly known as the sharp-leaved St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in summer, which are attractive to pollinators. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or coastal environments. Its medicinal properties are similar to other Hypericum species, though it is less commonly used in traditional herbal medicine."
