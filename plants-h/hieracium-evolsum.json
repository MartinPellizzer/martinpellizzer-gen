    "intro": "Hieracium evolsum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are yellow with ray florets. It produces achenes as its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Hieracium evolsum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize various habitats."
