    "intro": "Hymenophyllum pendulum, commonly known as the hanging fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features delicate, pendulous fronds that hang from trees, often in shaded, moist environments. The plant has thin, wiry rhizomes and produces spore-bearing structures called sorus on the underside of its fronds. Its leaves are typically linear and have a velvety texture, which helps retain moisture. Hymenophyllum pendulum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
