    "intro": "Hieracium saxifragum subsp. crinigerum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine regions. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a single head, with ray florets that are usually shorter than the central disk. This subspecies is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in harsh environments."
