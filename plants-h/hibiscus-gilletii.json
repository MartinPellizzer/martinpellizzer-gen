It features showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically blooming in summer. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves and is adapted to arid environments with its deep root system. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping.
