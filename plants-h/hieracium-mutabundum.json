    "intro": "Hieracium mutabundum, commonly known as the variable hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with basal leaves that are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer, producing small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium mutabundum is known for its variability in leaf shape and color, which contributes to its common name."
