    "intro": "Heliopsis minor, commonly known as the dwarf sunflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom from late spring to early fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with lance-shaped, dark green leaves. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its botanical name reflects its affinity for sunlight, as \"heliopsis\" means \"sun-like\" in Greek."
