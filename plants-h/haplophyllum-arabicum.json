    "intro": "Haplophyllum arabicum, commonly known as the Arabian sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, showing a high degree of adaptability to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of wax to reduce water loss. Haplophyllum arabicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xerophytic gardens."
