    "intro": "Hebe parkinsoniana, commonly known as the silver hebe, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators. Hebe parkinsoniana is relatively low maintenance and suitable for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salty air."
