    "intro": "Helianthemum squamatum, commonly known as the scaly rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, evergreen leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving them a scaly appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically tubular in shape. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils. Helianthemum squamatum is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
