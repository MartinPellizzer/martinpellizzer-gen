    "intro": "Helonias latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf helonias, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Limnanthaceae and is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves and small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Helonias latifolia plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
