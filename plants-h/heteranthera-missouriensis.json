    "intro": "Heteranthera missouriensis, commonly known as Missouri arrowhead, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically floating on the water surface. The plant produces small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It has two types of stamens, which is reflected in its scientific name, and it thrives in shallow, still freshwater habitats. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability."
