    "intro": "Hemarthria rugosa, commonly known as hairy silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the warmer regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, silver-green leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Hemarthria rugosa is often found in moist, well-drained soils, such as those in wetlands or along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
