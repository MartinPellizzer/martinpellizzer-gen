It is native to southern South America, particularly Chile and Argentina, and is characterized by its yellow flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It has a hairy stem and produces small, inconspicuous fruits known as cypselae. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
