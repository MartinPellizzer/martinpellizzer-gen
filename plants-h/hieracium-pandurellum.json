It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom from summer to autumn. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its flowering stems are usually unbranched and can reach heights of up to 30 centimeters. Hieracium pandurellum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common weed in agricultural and natural areas."
