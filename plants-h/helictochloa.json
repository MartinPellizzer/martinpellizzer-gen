    "intro": "Helictochloa, commonly known as the needlegrass, is a genus of grasses belonging to the family Poaceae. These plants are characterized by their slender, often needle-like leaves and compact growth habit. They are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Helictochloa species are often used in restoration ecology due to their ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Their small, spikelet-based inflorescences are an important feature for identification."
