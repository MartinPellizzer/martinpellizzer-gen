    "intro": "Hieracium spilophyllum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Hieracium spilophyllum is often found in open meadows and on slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
