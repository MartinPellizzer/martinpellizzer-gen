    "intro": "Heliconia laneana, commonly known as the red-veined heliconia, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its large, brightly colored bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds. Its inflorescence is typically red or orange with contrasting green veins, making it visually striking. Heliconia laneana is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and greenhouses due to its vibrant appearance and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
