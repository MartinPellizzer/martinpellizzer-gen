It is characterized by its woody stem and broad, glossy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by distinctive, berry-like fruits. Hortia arborea thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
