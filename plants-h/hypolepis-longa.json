    "intro": "Hypolepis longa, commonly known as the long-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its long, narrow fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. The long-leaf fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
