    "intro": "Heliotropium giessii, commonly known as the desert heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its small, violet or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling those of the common heliotrope. Its leaves are typically narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Heliotropium giessii is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
