    "intro": "Hesperis elata, commonly known as the tall honesty, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many cruciferous plants. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Hesperis elata is often grown in gardens for its delicate appearance and is also valued for its historical use in herbal medicine."
