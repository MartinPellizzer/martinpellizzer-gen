    "intro": "Hibiscus spinifex, commonly known as the spiny hibiscus, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It features woody stems covered in sharp, spiny projections, which serve as a natural defense mechanism. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a prominent yellow or orange center. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough, textured surface. Hibiscus spinifex thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant in suitable climates."
