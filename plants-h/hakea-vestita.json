    "intro": "Hakea vestita, commonly known as the white-leaf hakea, is an evergreen shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in a fine, white pubescence. Hakea vestita is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
