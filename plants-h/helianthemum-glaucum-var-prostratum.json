    "intro": "Helianthemum glaucum var. prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a whitish, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
