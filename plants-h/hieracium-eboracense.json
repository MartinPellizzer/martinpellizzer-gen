    "intro": "Hieracium eboracense, commonly known as the York dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the United Kingdom. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and woodland edges. Its yellow flowers bloom in early summer, and it produces a distinctive, rough, hairy seed head that aids in wind dispersal. The plant is considered a rare and protected species in some regions due to its limited distribution."
