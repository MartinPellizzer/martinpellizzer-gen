    "intro": "Hakea baueri, commonly known as the dwarf hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive, bottle-shaped fruits. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Hakea baueri typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its compact size and ornamental features make it a popular choice for coastal and garden landscapes."
