    "intro": "Hieracium impressum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped with serrated edges, and its flowers are yellow with ray florets. Hieracium impressum is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators in its native habitats."
