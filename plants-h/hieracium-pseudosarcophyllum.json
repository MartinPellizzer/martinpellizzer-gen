    "intro": "Hieracium pseudosarcophyllum, commonly known as the false death's-head hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant features basal leaves that are lanceolate and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowering stems bear yellow ray florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
