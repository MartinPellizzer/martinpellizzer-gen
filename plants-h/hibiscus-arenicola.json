    "intro": "Hibiscus arenicola, commonly known as the sand hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought and salt spray. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, and it blooms during the summer months. Hibiscus arenicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
