    "intro": "Hemarthria compressa var. fasciculata, commonly known as the narrowleaf hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features fine, grass-like leaves with a compressed, cylindrical stem, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense clusters. The plant is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic environments. Its dense growth habit also makes it a popular choice for ornamental and ecological landscaping."
