    "intro": "Habenaria brachydactyla, commonly known as the narrow-lobed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late summer or early autumn. The plant features long, strap-like leaves and produces a single spike of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
