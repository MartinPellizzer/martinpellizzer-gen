    "intro": "Hypericum hirsutum var. congestum, commonly known as the sticky St. John's wort, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance and contribute to its common name. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open woodlands. Its medicinal properties have been studied, though it is less commonly used than other Hypericum species."
