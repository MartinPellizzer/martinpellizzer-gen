    "intro": "Hieracium nalunsicum, commonly known as the Nalunsic hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers consist of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
