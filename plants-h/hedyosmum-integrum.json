It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is considered a weed in parts of the United States."
