    "intro": "Hymenophyllum cuneatum var. terminale, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in tropical rainforests."
