    "intro": "Heliconia cararensis, commonly known as the Carare heliconia, is a tropical plant native to Central America, particularly found in the Caribbean and parts of northern South America. It belongs to the Heliconiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often hidden within the bracts, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Heliconia cararensis is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
