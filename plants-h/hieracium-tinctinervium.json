    "intro": "Hieracium tinctinervium, commonly known as the purple-stemmed hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are distinctly purple-tinged. The flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, producing small seeds that are dispersed by the wind."
