It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, basal leaves and yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, grassy habitats. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its spread. Its common name reflects the hawk-like appearance of its flower heads."
