    "intro": "Huperzia fargesii, commonly known as the Farges' clubmoss, is a species of evergreen fern ally native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and needle-like, spirally arranged leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its sporophytes produce spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are dispersed by wind. Huperzia fargesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
