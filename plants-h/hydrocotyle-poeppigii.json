    "intro": "Hydrocotyle poeppigii, commonly known as the broadleaf water shield, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often floating on the water surface, with the stems submerged in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are typically borne on short stalks above the water. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, contributing to its role in aquatic ecosystems. Hydrocotyle poeppigii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize water bodies by reducing erosion."
