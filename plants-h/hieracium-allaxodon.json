    "intro": "Hieracium allaxodon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinct basal rosette. Native to Europe, it thrives in dry meadows and rocky soils. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
