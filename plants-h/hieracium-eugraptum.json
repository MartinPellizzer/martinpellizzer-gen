    "intro": "Hieracium eugraptum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring temperate climates. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant produces numerous small, oval seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium eugraptum is also known for its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in drier environments."
