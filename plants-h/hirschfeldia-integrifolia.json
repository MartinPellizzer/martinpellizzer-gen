    "intro": "Hirschfeldia integrifolia, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Hirschfeldia integrifolia is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
