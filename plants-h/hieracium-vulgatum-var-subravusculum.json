    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum var. subravusculum, commonly known as the lesser common hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. This variant is distinguished by its smaller, more compact inflorescence compared to the typical H. vulgatum. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are upright and often branched. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas."
