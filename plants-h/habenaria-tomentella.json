    "intro": "Habenaria tomentella, commonly known as the woolly orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and produces striking, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous, and it has a complex root system that helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
