    "intro": "Hypolaena, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with small, pale green or white flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, exhibiting an epiphytic lifestyle, meaning it derives moisture and nutrients from the air rather than soil. Its leaves are often pale green and lack a prominent midrib, contributing to its ghostly appearance. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Hypolaena is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
