    "intro": "Hieracium trichodorum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its common name. Hieracium trichodorum is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
