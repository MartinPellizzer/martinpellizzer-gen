    "intro": "Helichrysum xanthinum, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that resemble tiny suns, hence its common name. The plant produces bract-like leaves that are often mistaken for petals, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Helichrysum xanthinum is also known for its longevity when dried, as its flowers retain their color and shape for extended periods."
