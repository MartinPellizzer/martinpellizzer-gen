    "intro": "Hypericum aviculariifolium subsp. uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flower St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with prominent stamens, typical of the Hypericaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
