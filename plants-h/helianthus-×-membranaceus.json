    "intro": "Helianthus \u00d7 membranaceus, commonly known as the swamp sunflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Its scientific name reflects its hybrid origin, as it is a cross between Helianthus atrorubens and Helianthus rugosus. The swamp sunflower plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
