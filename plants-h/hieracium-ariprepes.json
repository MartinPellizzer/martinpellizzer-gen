    "intro": "Hieracium ariprepes, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Hieracium ariprepes is an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native plants due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production."
