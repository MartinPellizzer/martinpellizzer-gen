    "intro": "Hymenolobium velutinum, commonly known as the velvet acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and compound leaves with small, oval leaflets. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that are clustered in panicles, which bloom during the rainy season. Its fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Hymenolobium velutinum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
