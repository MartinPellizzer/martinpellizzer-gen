    "intro": "Hibiscus lancibracteatus, commonly known as the long-bract hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range from pink to white in color. The plant features elongated bracts that give it its common name and serve as a protective structure for the flower. Hibiscus lancibracteatus is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a food source for various pollinators and its ornamental value in horticulture."
