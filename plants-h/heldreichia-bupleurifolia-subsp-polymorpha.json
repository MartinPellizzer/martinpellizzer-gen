    "intro": "Heldreichia bupleurifolia subsp. polymorpha, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are basal, ovate to lanceolate, and often covered in a dense layer of short hairs. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient component of mountain ecosystems."
