    "intro": "Hieracium prasioellipticum, commonly known as the yellow false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in early summer, and it has lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. It is often mistaken for true dandelions due to its similar appearance but is distinguished by its smaller size and different leaf structure."
