    "intro": "Hakea leucoclada, commonly known as the white-flowered hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers arranged in cylindrical spikes, which bloom in spring. It is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in heathlands and rocky soils. Hakea leucoclada is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
