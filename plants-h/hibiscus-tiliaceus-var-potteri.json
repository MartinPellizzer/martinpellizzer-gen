    "intro": "Hibiscus tiliaceus var. potteri, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its spreading, often prostrate growth habit, with thick, fleshy stems that are adapted to salt spray and sandy soils. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the flowers are showy, with five petals and a prominent central column. It produces orange or yellow fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by water or wind. This species is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize shorelines and tolerate harsh maritime conditions."
