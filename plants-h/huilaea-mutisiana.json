    "intro": "Huilaea mutisiana, commonly known as the Huilaea mutisiana, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its native habitat. It produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, Huilaea mutisiana is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
