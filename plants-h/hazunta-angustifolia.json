    "intro": "Hazunta angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hazunta, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy texture, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often slightly serrated. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom during the cooler months. Hazunta angustifolia is adapted to rocky soils and requires well-drained conditions to thrive. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance once established."
