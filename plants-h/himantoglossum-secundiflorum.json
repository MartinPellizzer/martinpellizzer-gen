    "intro": "Himantoglossum secundiflorum, commonly known as the lesser marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wet meadows and marshes in Europe. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from waterlogged soils, and it plays an important role in supporting local pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
