    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum var. mutabile, commonly known as the variable hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disc. The variability in its appearance, particularly in leaf shape and flower size, gives it its common name."
