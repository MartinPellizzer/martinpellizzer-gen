    "intro": "Hyssopus officinalis subsp. canescens, commonly known as white hyssop, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its grayish-green, hairy leaves and spikes of pale blue to white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and thrives in full sun. It is often found in Mediterranean climates and is valued for its aromatic properties. The subspecies is closely related to the common hyssop, but it differs in its more compact growth habit and lighter flower color."
