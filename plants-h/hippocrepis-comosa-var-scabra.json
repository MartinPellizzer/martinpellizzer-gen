It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive helmet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a rough texture, which gives the variety its name \"scabra.\" The flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with a prominent lip that distinguishes it from other orchid species."
