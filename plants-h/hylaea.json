    "intro": "Hylaea, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Hylaea species produce showy, five-petaled flowers that are usually pink or white in color. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
