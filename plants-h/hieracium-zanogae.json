    "intro": "Hieracium zanogae, commonly known as the Zanogae Hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow ray florets surrounded by a dense cluster of tubular disc florets. Native to the Mediterranean region, it thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open fields. The plant produces small, elongated achenes with pappus hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its arid environment, making it a resilient yet ecologically significant species."
