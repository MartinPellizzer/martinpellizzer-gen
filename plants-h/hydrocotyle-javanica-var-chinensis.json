    "intro": "Hydrocotyle javanica var. chinensis, commonly known as Chinese water shield, is a floating aquatic plant native to East Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, which are often borne on short stalks. Its rhizomes spread across the waterbed, allowing it to colonize a wide range of wetland habitats. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and stabilizing water surfaces."
