    "intro": "Hornschuchia duckei, commonly known as the duck's egg plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, egg-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and has slender, branched stems covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Hornschuchia duckei thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
