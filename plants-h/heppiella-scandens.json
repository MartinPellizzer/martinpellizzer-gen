    "intro": "Heppiella scandens, commonly known as the creeping liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Peltasporaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure composed of a flat, ribbon-like stem covered in tiny, leaf-like structures called phyllids. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the upper surface of the thallus. Heppiella scandens plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
