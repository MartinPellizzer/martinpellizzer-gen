It features small, pink to white flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are often covered in fine hairs. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit, with succulent, fleshy leaves that store water. It thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Herniaria sphacelata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in rock gardens."
