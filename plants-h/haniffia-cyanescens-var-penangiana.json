    "intro": "Haniffia cyanescens var. penangiana, commonly known as the Penang blue orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to Malaysia. It is characterized by its vibrant blue petals and sepals, which are often tinged with purple or pink hues. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as tropical rainforests, where it thrives on the forest floor or on tree bark. Its flowers are fragrant and bloom during the rainy season, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
