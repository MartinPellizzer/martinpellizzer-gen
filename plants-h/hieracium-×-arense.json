    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 arense, commonly known as the sand harebell, is a hybrid plant species within the genus Hieracium, which belongs to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy stems and daisy-like yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as coastal dunes or disturbed areas. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, where it can sometimes become invasive. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
