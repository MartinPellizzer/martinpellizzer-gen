    "intro": "Hoya latifolia, commonly known as the \"Wax Plant\" or \"Porcelain Flower,\" is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often variegated with shades of white, green, and pink. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, waxy flowers that bloom in shades of pink or white, often with a subtle fragrance. Hoya latifolia prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its slow growth and unique appearance make it a favored ornamental plant among succulent enthusiasts."
