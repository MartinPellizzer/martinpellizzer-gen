    "intro": "Hieracium eumischodes, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its bright yellow flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, and the leaves are lance-shaped with rough textures. Hieracium eumischodes is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit and ability to spread rapidly."
