    "intro": "Helianthemum lineare var. violaceum, commonly known as the violet sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant once established. This species is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
