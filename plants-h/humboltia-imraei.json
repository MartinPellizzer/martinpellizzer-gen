    "intro": "Humboltia imraei, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 feet, characterized by its hairy stems and gray-green foliage. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seed heads that disperse its seeds via the wind. Humboltia imraei is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
