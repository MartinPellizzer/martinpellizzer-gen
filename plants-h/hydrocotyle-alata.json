    "intro": "Hydrocotyle alata, commonly known as silverleaf marsh pennywort, is a low-growing aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in suitable moist environments. Hydrocotyle alata is often used in water gardens and as a decorative plant in ponds due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability."
