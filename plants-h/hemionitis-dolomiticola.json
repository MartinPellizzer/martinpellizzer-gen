    "intro": "Hemionitis dolomiticola, commonly known as the Dolomitic hemionitis, is a rare and specialized fern native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It thrives in calcareous soils and is adapted to the extreme environmental conditions of its mountainous habitat. The plant has a unique morphology, characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It reproduces via spores, typical of the fern family, and is closely related to other members of the Hemionitidaceae family. Due to its restricted distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
