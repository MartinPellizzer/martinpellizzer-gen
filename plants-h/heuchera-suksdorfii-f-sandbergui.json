    "intro": "Heuchera suksdorfii f. sandbergui, commonly known as the Sandberg's alumroot, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features dense, dark green foliage with a slight purple tinge, and its flowers are small, bell-shaped, and typically pink or reddish in color. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. It is valued for its ornamental leaves and ability to naturalize, often forming clumps that spread slowly over time. This cultivar is particularly noted for its cold hardiness and ability to maintain its color throughout the growing season."
