It is characterized by its slender, hair-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often found in temperate climates. Its seeds are small and can be dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. It is a member of the Poaceae family and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
