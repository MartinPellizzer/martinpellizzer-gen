    "intro": "Hakonechloa macra var. albovariegata, commonly known as the silver ripple grass, is a low-growing, clump-forming perennial grass that thrives in partial to full shade. Its foliage features striking silver-white variegation against a backdrop of deep green, creating a visually appealing contrast. The plant produces delicate, feathery panicles of pale green flowers in late spring to early summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is particularly noted for its compact growth habit and resistance to common lawn weeds."
