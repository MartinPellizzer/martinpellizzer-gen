    "intro": "Hieracium chondrillifolium subsp. crinisquamum, commonly known as the silky hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
