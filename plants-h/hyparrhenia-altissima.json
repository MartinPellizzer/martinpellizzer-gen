It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically green with a slight bluish tinge. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered at the ends of the stems. Hyparrhenia altissima is adapted to a variety of soil types but thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands, wetlands, and along water bodies."
