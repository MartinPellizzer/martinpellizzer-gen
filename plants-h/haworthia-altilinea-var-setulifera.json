    "intro": "Haworthia altilinea var. setulifera, commonly known as the woolly Haworthia, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to South Africa. It features dense, white to grayish-white tubercles that give it a fuzzy appearance, particularly on the outer edges of its leaves. The leaves are typically bluish-green with a waxy coating, and the plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or container cultivation. This variety is prized for its unique texture and low maintenance requirements."
