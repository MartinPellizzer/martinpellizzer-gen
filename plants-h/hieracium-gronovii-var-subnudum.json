    "intro": "Hieracium gronovii var. subnudum, commonly known as the naked-stem hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, ascending stems and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitats. This variant is often found in meadows and open woodlands, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and botanical identification."
