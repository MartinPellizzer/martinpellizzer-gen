    "intro": "Haplopappus bellidifolius var. brachylepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
