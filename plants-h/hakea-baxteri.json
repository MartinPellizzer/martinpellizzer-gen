    "intro": "Hakea baxteri, commonly known as the Baxter's hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its dense, cylindrical flower spikes that appear in winter. The plant has thick, leathery leaves that help it conserve water in its arid habitat. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, cone-like seed pods. Hakea baxteri is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
