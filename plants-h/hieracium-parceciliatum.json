    "intro": "Hieracium parceciliatum, commonly known as the Italian hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It features lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
