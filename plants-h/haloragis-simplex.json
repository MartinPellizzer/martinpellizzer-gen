    "intro": "Haloragis simplex, commonly known as the common water-starwort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands. The plant has slender, branching stems that often float on the water surface, with small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Haloragis simplex plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and young fish."
