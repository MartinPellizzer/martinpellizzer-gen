    "intro": "Haplopappus bloomeri subsp. angustatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf haplopappus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The small, yellow flowers appear in clusters and are followed by bristly seed heads that aid in wind dispersal."
