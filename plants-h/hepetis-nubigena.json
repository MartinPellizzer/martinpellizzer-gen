    "intro": "Hepetis nubigena, commonly known as the cloud heather, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are evergreen, dark green, and leathery, adapted to thrive in cool, moist environments. Hepetis nubigena is often found in high-altitude cloud forests, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
