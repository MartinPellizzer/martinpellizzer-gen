    "intro": "Hypenanthe, commonly known as the perianth, refers to the collective term for the floral parts that surround the reproductive organs of a flower. In some species, the hypenanthe may consist of separate sepals and petals, while in others, these parts are fused into a single structure. It plays a crucial role in attracting pollinators and protecting the flower's reproductive structures. The hypenanthe can vary in color, shape, and size depending on the plant species. Its structure is often adapted to the specific pollination strategies of the plant."
