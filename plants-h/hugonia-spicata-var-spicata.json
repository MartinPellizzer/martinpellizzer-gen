It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowering stems are often spiky or bracted, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
