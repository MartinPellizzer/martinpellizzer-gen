    "intro": "Hedysarum denticulatum, commonly known as the toothed milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces slender, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Hedysarum denticulatum is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a forage plant for livestock."
