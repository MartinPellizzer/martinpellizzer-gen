    "intro": "Hepetis guaritermae, commonly known as the Guariterma hepetis, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
