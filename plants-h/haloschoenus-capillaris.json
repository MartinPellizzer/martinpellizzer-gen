    "intro": "Haloschoenus capillaris, commonly known as the slender saltgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often found in dune environments and along the edges of salt lakes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils, making it an important pioneer species in coastal restoration. Haloschoenus capillaris plays a crucial role in preventing erosion and supporting local biodiversity in its habitat."
