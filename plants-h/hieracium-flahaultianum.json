    "intro": "Hieracium flahaultianum, commonly known as the Flahault's hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a single, tall flowering stem that bears yellow disk flowers surrounded by ray florets. Native to central and eastern Europe, this plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It is a perennial herb that can spread through rhizomes, forming dense colonies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species in some regions."
