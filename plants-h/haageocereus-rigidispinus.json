    "intro": "Haageocereus rigidispinus, commonly known as the rigid spined hedgehog cactus, is a columnar cactus native to Mexico. It features a tall, cylindrical stem with spiny areoles and clusters of white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a dense covering of spines, which provide protection from herbivores. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for arid garden environments."
