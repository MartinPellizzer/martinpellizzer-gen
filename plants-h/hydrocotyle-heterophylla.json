    "intro": "Hydrocotyle heterophylla, commonly known as the water pennywort, is a semi-aquatic plant native to various regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It exhibits a unique ability to adapt its leaf morphology depending on its environment, with submerged leaves being thread-like and floating leaves being broader. The plant typically grows in shallow water, wetlands, and along the margins of ponds and streams. Its small, white flowers are borne in clusters and bloom during the warmer months. Hydrocotyle heterophylla plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
