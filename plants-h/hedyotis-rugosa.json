    "intro": "Hedyotis rugosa, commonly known as the rough bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Hedyotis rugosa is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense mats."
