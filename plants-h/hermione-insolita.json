    "intro": "Hermione insolita, commonly known as the elusive moonshade, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It features delicate, silver-pink petals that open only under moonlight, making it a nocturnal bloom. The plant has a unique root system that absorbs minerals from the soil through a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its arid environment. Due to its rarity and mystical appearance, it is highly sought after by botanists and herbalists alike."
