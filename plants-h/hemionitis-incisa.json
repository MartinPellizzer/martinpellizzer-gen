    "intro": "Hemionitis incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water fern, is a small aquatic plant native to eastern Asia. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes and wetlands. The plant has finely divided, linear leaves that float on the water surface, giving it a delicate appearance. Its reproductive structures are borne on specialized fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Hemionitis incisa is often used in water gardens and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
