    "intro": "Hakea dryophylla, commonly known as the dryland hakea, is a shrub native to western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and narrow, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody, cylindrical fruits that contain seeds. Hakea dryophylla is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal heathlands. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
