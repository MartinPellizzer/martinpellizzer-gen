    "intro": "Hypericum humifusum subsp. orbiculatum, commonly known as the roundleaf St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It features small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant has opposite, ovate to round leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its medicinal properties have been studied, though it is less commonly used than other St. John's wort species."
