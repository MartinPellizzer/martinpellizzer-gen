    "intro": "Halimium multiflorum var. macrophyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are succulent, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps the plant conserve water in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. This variety is distinguished by its larger, more robust leaves compared to other varieties of Halimium."
