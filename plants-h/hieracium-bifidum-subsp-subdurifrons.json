It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and rocky soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrowly lanceolate, with a hairy texture, and the flowers are yellow, arranged in a flat-topped cluster. It is notable for its ability to thrive in disturbed habitats and its role in supporting pollinator populations."
