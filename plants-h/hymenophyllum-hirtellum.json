    "intro": "Hymenophyllum hirtellum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery, and hairy fronds that are often covered in fine, short hairs. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Hymenophyllum hirtellum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
