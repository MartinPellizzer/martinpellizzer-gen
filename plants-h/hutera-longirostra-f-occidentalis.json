    "intro": "Hutera longirostra f. occidentalis, commonly known as the western long-beaked hutera, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and distinctive, elongated floral structures that resemble a beak, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests or dense undergrowth. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
