    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. stenogrammum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
