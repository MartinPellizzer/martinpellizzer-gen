    "intro": "Hieracium sabaudum var. dispalatum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. This variety is distinguished by its smaller, more compact growth compared to other hawkweed species."
