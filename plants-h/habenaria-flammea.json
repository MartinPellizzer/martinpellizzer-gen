    "intro": "Habenaria flammea, commonly known as the flame orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, vividly colored flowers that range from red to orange, often with a contrasting yellow or white throat. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually broad and grass-like, and the inflorescence consists of a spike bearing multiple flowers. The orchid's botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in the ecological systems of its native habitats."
