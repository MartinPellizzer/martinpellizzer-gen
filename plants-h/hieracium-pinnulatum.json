    "intro": "Hieracium pinnulatum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can reach heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a hairy texture, while the flowers are yellow and bloom in the summer months. Hieracium pinnulatum is also known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain habitats."
