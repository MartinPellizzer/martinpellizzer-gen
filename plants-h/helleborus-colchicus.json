    "intro": "Helleborus colchicus, commonly known as the meadow hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dark green, leathery leaves that are typically palmately lobed, and it produces clusters of pale green to white flowers with a distinctive, helmet-like structure. The plant is known for its toxic properties, containing compounds such as cardiac glycosides, which can be harmful if ingested. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it both a notable ornamental plant and a species of ecological interest."
