    "intro": "Helleborine latifolia f. obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaved helleborine, is a hybrid orchid species characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded woodland habitats. The plant produces clusters of greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive hooded structure, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies in suitable conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light levels."
