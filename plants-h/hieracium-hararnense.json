    "intro": "Hieracium hararnense, commonly known as the Hararn Valley hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually basal, with a rough or hairy texture, and the flowers are yellow, often arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
