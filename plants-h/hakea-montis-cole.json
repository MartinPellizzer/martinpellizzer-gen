    "intro": "Hakea montis-cole, commonly known as the Mount Cole hakea, is a shrub native to the wetter regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical or club-shaped inflorescences that bear small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in heathlands and sclerophyllous forests, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. Hakea montis-cole is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for native pollinators."
