    "intro": "Huernia clavigera, commonly known as the horned lithops, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, angular, and often spiky appearance, with thick, fleshy leaves that store water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its striking appearance and low maintenance, it is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant."
