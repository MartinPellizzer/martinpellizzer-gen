    "intro": "Hedera marginata-rubra, commonly known as the red-veined ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to parts of Asia. It features dark green, lobed leaves with striking red veins that stand out against the foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Hedera marginata-rubra is relatively low-maintenance but requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
