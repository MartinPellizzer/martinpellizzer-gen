    "intro": "Hieracium nigropilosum, commonly known as the black-hairy hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
