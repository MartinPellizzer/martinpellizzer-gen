    "intro": "Hippocratea verdickii, commonly known as the velvet leaf orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its large, velvety green leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that attracts pollinators like bees and wasps. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
