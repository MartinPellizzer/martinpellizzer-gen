    "intro": "Helianthemum guttatum f. inconspicuum, commonly known as the inconspicuous rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in early spring, typically on hairy stems. The plant has succulent leaves that are often covered in small, translucent glands, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. This variety is less showy than its parent species, making it somewhat overlooked in the wild."
