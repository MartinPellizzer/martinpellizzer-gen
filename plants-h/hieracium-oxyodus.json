    "intro": "Hieracium oxyodus, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems, which are typical features of many dandelion relatives. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are arranged in a composite head. Hieracium oxyodus is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in various habitats."
