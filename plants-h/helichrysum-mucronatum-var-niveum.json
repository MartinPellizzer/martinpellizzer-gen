    "intro": "Helichrysum mucronatum var. niveum, commonly known as the white everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that resemble tiny stars. The plant produces papery, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to colonize open areas. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in dried flower arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms."
