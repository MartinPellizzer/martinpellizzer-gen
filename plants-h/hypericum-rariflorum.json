    "intro": "Hypericum rariflorum, commonly known as the rare-flowered St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has opposite, elliptical leaves with serrated edges, and it produces red or orange berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
