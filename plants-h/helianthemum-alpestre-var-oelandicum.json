    "intro": "Helianthemum alpestre var. oelandicum, commonly known as the Oeland stonecrop, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to retain moisture in harsh, rocky environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found growing on rocky slopes and among gravelly soils. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
