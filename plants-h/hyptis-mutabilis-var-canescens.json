    "intro": "Hyptis mutabilis var. canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf hyptis, is a perennial herb native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its grayish-silver foliage, which results from the dense covering of fine hairs on its leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its aromatic leaves and adaptability, it is also used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
