    "intro": "Hypoestes verticillaris var. hildebrandtii, commonly known as the \"Snowflake\" plant, is a compact, trailing shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover due to its trailing habit. Its ornamental value comes from its striking color contrast between the dark green leaves and the delicate floral display."
