    "intro": "Hesperis spectabilis, commonly known as the showy crucifer, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many familiar garden plants such as cabbages and mustards. The plant is characterized by its tall, branching stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers have four petals arranged in a cross shape, typical of the family. Hesperis spectabilis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
