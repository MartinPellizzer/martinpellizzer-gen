It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellowish to reddish flowering heads. The plant typically features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the upper leaves are more narrow. It produces small, dandelion-like flowers that are often clustered in a single head, and it thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
