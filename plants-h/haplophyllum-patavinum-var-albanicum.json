    "intro": "Haplophyllum patavinum var. albanicum, commonly known as the Albanian haplophyllum, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is a low-growing, perennial herb with small, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a thick layer of white, waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, mountainous environments of its native range. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
