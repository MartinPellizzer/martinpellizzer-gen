    "intro": "Helianthemum ledifolium f. laxiflorum, commonly known as the laxiflorous rock rose, is a low-growing succulent shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, showy yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to Mediterranean-style landscapes."
