    "intro": "Heliotropium erosum var. prostratum, commonly known as prostrate heliotrope, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features prostrate or decumbent stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive fragrance reminiscent of violets. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and wetlands."
