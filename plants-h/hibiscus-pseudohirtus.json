    "intro": "Hibiscus pseudohirtus, commonly known as the velvetleaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red, typically blooming during the warmer months. Hibiscus pseudohirtus is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, with a fibrous root system adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
