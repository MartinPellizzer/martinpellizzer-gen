    "intro": "Hakea spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often blue-green in color, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces striking, bottlebrush-like inflorescences that range in color from white to pink, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, Mediterranean climates. Hakea spathulata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in arid environments."
