    "intro": "Haemocharis pubescens, commonly known as the golden torch ginger, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright orange-red bracts that resemble a torch, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Haemocharis pubescens is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses due to its vibrant appearance and unique foliage."
