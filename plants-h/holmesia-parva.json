    "intro": "Holmesia parva, commonly known as the dwarf holmesia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California. It typically grows to a height of less than two feet and features dense, leathery leaves that are dark green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable plant for coastal gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
