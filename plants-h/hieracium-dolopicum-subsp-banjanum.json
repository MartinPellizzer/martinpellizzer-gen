It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped with hairy surfaces. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range."
