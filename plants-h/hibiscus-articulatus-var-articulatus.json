    "intro": "Hibiscus articulatus var. articulatus, commonly known as the slender hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink or red. The leaves are usually heart-shaped and covered with fine hairs, while the flowers have five distinct petals and a prominent, five-lobed stigma. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it a common ornamental and sometimes invasive plant in certain environments."
