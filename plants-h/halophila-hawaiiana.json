    "intro": "Halophila hawaiiana, commonly known as the Hawaiian halophyte, is a marine flowering plant native to the coastal waters of Hawaii. It belongs to the Alismataceae family and is characterized by its submerged or emergent growth in shallow, brackish waters. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are adapted to aquatic environments. It plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal sediments and providing habitat for marine life. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and invasive species."
