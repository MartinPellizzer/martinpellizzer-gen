    "intro": "Hylethale, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, translucent greenish-white flowers. The plant lacks leaves and relies on its roots for photosynthesis, making it a hemiparasitic species. It thrives in specific wetland habitats, often found on the trunks of trees in the Florida scrub. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
