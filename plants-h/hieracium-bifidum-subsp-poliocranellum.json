    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. poliocranellum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and basal rosettes of narrowly lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Compositae family. It is native to southern Europe and thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
