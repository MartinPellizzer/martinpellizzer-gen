    "intro": "Hoya odorata subsp. miquilingensis, commonly known as the Miquilingensis Waffleplant, is a rare epiphytic species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often waxy and covered in a fine, pubescent layer. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers with a fragrant, sweet scent, typically in shades of white and pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly sought after by collectors and botanists alike."
