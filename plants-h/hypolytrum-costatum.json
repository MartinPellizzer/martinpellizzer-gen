    "intro": "Hypolytrum costatum, commonly known as the zigzag grass, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and southern regions of Australia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in coastal or inland areas. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that have a distinctive zigzag pattern along their edges. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it is often found in open habitats such as woodlands and heaths. Hypolytrum costatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
