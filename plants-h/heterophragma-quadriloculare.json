It is characterized by its delicate, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its flowers are small and usually white or pale purple, with a distinctive bilabiate shape. Heterophragma quadriloculare is often found in temperate regions and is known for its unique adaptations to aquatic life."
