    "intro": "Hoffmannseggia stricta var. demissa, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a hairy stem and basal leaves that are often lobed or toothed. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It has adapted to survive in harsh environments through its deep root system and ability to store water in its leaves. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in drought conditions."
