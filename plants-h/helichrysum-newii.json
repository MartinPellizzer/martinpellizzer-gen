    "intro": "Helichrysum newii, commonly known as the golden marguerite or Newii's everlastings, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers that resemble daisies, which remain vibrant even when dried. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Helichrysum newii is also valued for its ornamental use and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
