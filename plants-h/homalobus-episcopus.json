    "intro": "Homalobus episcopus, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Andes, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The flowers, which can be pink or white, are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological significance in mountain ecosystems."
