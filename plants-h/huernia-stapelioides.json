    "intro": "Huernia stapelioides, commonly known as the \"Lion's Tail\" or \"Coral Cactus,\" is a succulent native to southern Africa. It features a compact, branching stem covered in dense, velvety spines and fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for collectors and succulent enthusiasts."
