    "intro": "Hieracium criosclerum, commonly known as the frost-hardy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow composite flowers, which are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, demonstrating adaptations to cold and harsh climates. Hieracium criosclerum is known for its ability to survive in low-nutrient soils and is often found in meadows and open slopes at high elevations."
