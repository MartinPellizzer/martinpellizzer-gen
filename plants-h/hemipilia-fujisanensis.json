    "intro": "Hemipilia fujisanensis, commonly known as the Japanese ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Japan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fragrant, and often pale-colored flowers. The plant typically grows on cliffs or in rocky crevices, showcasing its adaptation to harsh, alpine environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while its inflorescence bears a single, showy flower. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemipilia fujisanensis is considered a conservation concern."
