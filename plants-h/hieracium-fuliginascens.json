It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are rough and hairy, and the flowers are yellow with a distinctive dark center. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
