It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has basal leaves that are often woolly or hairy, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in a variety of soil types. Hieracium subperfoliatum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
