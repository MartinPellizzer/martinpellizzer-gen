    "intro": "Hakea parvula, commonly known as the small-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often appearing in late summer to autumn. Hakea parvula is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal regions. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
