    "intro": "Hedeoma dentata, commonly known as the toothed hedeoma, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, giving it its common name. Its small, yellowish-green flowers bloom in late spring and early summer. Hedeoma dentata is often found in moist soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil."
