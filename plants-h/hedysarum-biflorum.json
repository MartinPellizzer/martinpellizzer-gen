    "intro": "Hedysarum biflorum, commonly known as the two-flowered milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and grasslands. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring. Its seed pods are elongated and contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Hedysarum biflorum is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
