    "intro": "Hippocrepis rupestris, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in open, sunny habitats. The plant features a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers are showy, with violet-blue petals and a distinctive hooded structure, resembling orchids. It is a member of the Leguminosae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
