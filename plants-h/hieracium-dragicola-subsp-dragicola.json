    "intro": "Hieracium dragicola subsp. dragicola, commonly known as the Dragicola hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and basal rosettes of narrowly lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a single head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
