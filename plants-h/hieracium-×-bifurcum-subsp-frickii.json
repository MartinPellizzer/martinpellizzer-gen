    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 bifurcum subsp. frickii, commonly known as the Frick's hawkweed, is a hybrid plant belonging to the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its rosette growth habit and produces yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. It has finely divided, grass-like leaves and is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through stolons. Due to its invasive potential, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
