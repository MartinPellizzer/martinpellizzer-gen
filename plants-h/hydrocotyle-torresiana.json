    "intro": "Hydrocotyle torresiana, commonly known as the Torresian water shield, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, ponds, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant features a rosette of broad, floating or submerged leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white or greenish flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom during the wet season. Hydrocotyle torresiana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
