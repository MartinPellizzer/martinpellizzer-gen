The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils and rocky habitats. Hedysarum variegatum is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects."
