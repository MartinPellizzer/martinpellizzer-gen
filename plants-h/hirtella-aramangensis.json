    "intro": "Hirtella aramangensis, commonly known as the Brazilian waxleaf hirtella, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that is often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with a glossy surface and a slightly waxy appearance. Hirtella aramangensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to shaded environments."
