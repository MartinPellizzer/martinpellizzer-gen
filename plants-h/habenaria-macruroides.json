    "intro": "Habenaria macruroides, commonly known as the long-stemmed marsh orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, greenish-yellow flowers with prominent, elongated sepals. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy habitats and is often found in marshes and along riverbanks. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the waterlogged soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The orchid's unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
