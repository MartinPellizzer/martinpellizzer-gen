    "intro": "Hieracium canipioides, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides, thriving in sunny conditions. Its leaves are rough and hairy, and the flowers are yellow with a central disk, producing small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium canipioides is often considered a weed due to its ability to spread rapidly in new environments."
