    "intro": "Hieracium cordatum subsp. dimorphotrichum, commonly known as the two-lobed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late spring to early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its dimorphic trichomes, which are two-lobed and give the plant its specific epithet. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
