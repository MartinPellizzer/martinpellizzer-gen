    "intro": "Helichrysum stoechas var. maritimum, commonly known as the maritime helichrysum, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces dense clusters of bright yellow, sunflower-like flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid or salty coastal environment. This plant is well adapted to maritime conditions, thriving in sandy or rocky soils with high salinity. Its resilience and ornamental value make it a popular choice for coastal gardens and xeriscaping."
