    "intro": "Haplopteris angustissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a species of clubmoss belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, a characteristic feature of its ancient lineage. Haplopteris angustissima is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it contributes to the biodiversity of understory vegetation."
