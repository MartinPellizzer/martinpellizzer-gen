It is characterized by its dense clusters of bright yellow, sun-like flowers that remain vibrant even after drying. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its ability to retain color makes it a popular choice for dried floral arrangements."
