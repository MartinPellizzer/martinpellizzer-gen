It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring temperate climates. It has a low-growing habit with creeping stolons, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
