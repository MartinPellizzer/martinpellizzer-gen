It features long, trailing stems that can reach several meters in length, often adorned with clusters of small, waxy, star-shaped flowers. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical, with a smooth texture and a glossy appearance. This species is known for its ability to thrive in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice among indoor gardeners due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
