    "intro": "Heuchera acerifolia, commonly known as the maple-leaf plantain, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It is characterized by its striking, maple-like leaves that are often variegated with red, orange, and green hues. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes primarily from its foliage rather than its flowers."
