    "intro": "Hydrocotyle quinqueloba var. quinqueradiata, commonly known as the five-lobed spurge or Indian nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its finely divided, palmately lobed leaves. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, greenish berries. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is native to parts of Asia and is valued both for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland habitats."
