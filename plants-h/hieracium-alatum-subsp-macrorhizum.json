    "intro": "Hieracium alatum subsp. macrorhizum, commonly known as the broadroot hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and basal rosettes of broadly ovate, dark green leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically from June to August, and has a taproot system that allows it to thrive in well-drained soils. It is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed sites. Due to its robust growth and adaptability, it can sometimes become invasive in certain regions."
