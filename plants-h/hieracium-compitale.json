    "intro": "Hieracium compitale, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow or orange flowers and hairy, often reddish stems. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. It has lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Hieracium compitale is an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production."
