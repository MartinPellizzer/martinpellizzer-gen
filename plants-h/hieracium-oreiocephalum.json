    "intro": "Hieracium oreiocephalum, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it tolerates cold and harsh environmental conditions. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Hieracium oreiocephalum is often found in mountain meadows and is adapted to the specific ecological niches of its habitat."
