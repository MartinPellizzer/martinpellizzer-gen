    "intro": "Helianthemum glaucopergamaceum, commonly known as the coastal helianthemum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub with compact, evergreen foliage that is covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found along coastal areas and rocky outcrops. Due to its drought tolerance and ability to withstand salt spray, it is well adapted to harsh maritime environments."
