    "intro": "Hieracium sphaerianthum, commonly known as the spherical hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a compact, spherical flower head that resembles a small globe. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with hairy surfaces. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, and is often found in disturbed soils. Hieracium sphaerianthum is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction."
