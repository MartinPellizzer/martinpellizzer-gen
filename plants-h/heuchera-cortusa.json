    "intro": "Heuchera cortusa, commonly known as the silver queen heuchera, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage with a bluish tinge, which becomes more pronounced in full sun. The plant produces upright, spikelike clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in the summer months. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Heuchera cortusa is a popular choice for woodland gardens due to its ornamental foliage and low maintenance requirements."
