    "intro": "Hieracium incisum subsp. pseudohittense, commonly known as the Hittense hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and its flowers are typically yellow, with ray florets that are often reduced or absent. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas, and is often found in moist or sandy soils. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural or natural landscapes."
