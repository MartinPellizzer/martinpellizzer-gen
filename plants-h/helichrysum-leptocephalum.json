    "intro": "Helichrysum leptocephalum, commonly known as the narrow-headed immortelle, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb with slender, upright stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces papery, persistent bracts that give it a distinctive appearance, often mistaken for flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for low-maintenance gardening."
