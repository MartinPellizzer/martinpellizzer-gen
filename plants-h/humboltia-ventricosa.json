    "intro": "Humboltia ventricosa, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its dry environment. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Humboltia ventricosa is adapted to thrive in harsh, sunny conditions with minimal water availability."
