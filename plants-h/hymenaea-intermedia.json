    "intro": "Hymenaea intermedia, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon basin. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and long, pendulous inflorescences that bear small, yellowish flowers. The tree produces hard, woody pods that contain multiple seeds, which are the edible Brazil nuts. Its bark is thick and fibrous, providing structural support and contributing to its longevity. The plant has significant ecological and economic importance, particularly for its nut production and role in rainforest biodiversity."
