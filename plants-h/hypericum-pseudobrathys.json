    "intro": "Hypericum pseudobrathys, commonly known as the narrowleaf St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in dense clusters along the stems. The plant has elliptical to lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its medicinal properties, though less studied than other Hypericum species, have sparked interest in traditional herbal medicine."
