    "intro": "Hieracium alpinum f. lamprophylloides, commonly known as the silver-leaved hawkweed, is a horticultural form of the alpine hawkweed. It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-white undersides on the leaves, which give it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature in cooler climates."
