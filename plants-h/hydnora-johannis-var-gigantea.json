    "intro": "Hydnora johannis var. gigantea, commonly known as the giant hydnora, is a unique parasitic plant found primarily in the succulent Karoo region of South Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing within the stems of certain species of Euphorbia. The plant produces a distinctive, fleshy, reddish-purple flower that emits a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators like flies. Its flowers are short-lived, opening only at night and closing by dawn. Due to its specialized ecological role and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
