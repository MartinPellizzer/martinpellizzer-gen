    "intro": "Hoya revolubilis, commonly known as the rotating hoya, is a unique species of epiphytic flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its waxy, dark green leaves that are often adorned with subtle veins and a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming during the summer months. Hoya revolubilis is notable for its ability to rotate its stems, a rare trait that aids in light exposure. Due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
