It is characterized by its striking, large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink and red. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and produces fruits that are capsule-like in structure. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in moist woodland or swampy areas. Its unique spiny structures on the stems and leaves make it distinguishable from other hibiscus species."
