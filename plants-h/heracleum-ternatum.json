    "intro": "Heracleum ternatum, commonly known as cow parsnip, is a tall biennial or perennial plant native to North America. It features a robust stem with distinctive, hairy leaves that are deeply lobed and resemble those of parsley. The plant produces umbrella-shaped clusters of small white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional herbal medicine. However, it contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, so caution is advised when handling it."
