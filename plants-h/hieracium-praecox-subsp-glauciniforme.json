    "intro": "Hieracium praecox subsp. glauciniforme, commonly known as the glaucous hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a fine, whitish down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The subspecies is notable for its glaucous (bluish-gray) foliage, which helps distinguish it from other hawkweed species."
