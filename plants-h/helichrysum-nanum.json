    "intro": "Helichrysum nanum, commonly known as the dwarf immortelle, is a small shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of tiny, golden-yellow flowers that resemble tiny suns. The plant produces small, papery bracts that give it a distinctive appearance, often mistaken for petals. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. The species is also valued for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in herbal remedies."
