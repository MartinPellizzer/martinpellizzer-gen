    "intro": "Heteropterys escalloniifolia var. jussieuana, commonly known as the Jussieu's huito, is a tropical shrub native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and have a slightly hairy underside. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom during the dry season. Its fruits are capsules that split open to release small, winged seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in warm climates for its foliage."
