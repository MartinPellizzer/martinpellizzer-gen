    "intro": "Hosackia stipularis var. stipularis, commonly known as the narrowleaf false indigo, is a perennial herb native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and palmately divided, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pea-like blue to violet flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. This species is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
