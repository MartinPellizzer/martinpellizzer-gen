    "intro": "Habenaria tohoensis, commonly known as the Toho Orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the rich, organic soil of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
