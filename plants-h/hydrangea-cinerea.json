    "intro": "Hydrangea cinerea, commonly known as the grayleaf hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its grayish-white bark and large, showy inflorescences that range from white to pink or blue depending on soil pH. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a rough, papery texture that contributes to its distinctive appearance. Hydrangea cinerea thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
