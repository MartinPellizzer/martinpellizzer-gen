It is characterized by its upright growth habit and basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is typically found in moist meadows and along stream banks in temperate regions. This form is distinguished by its elongated, sometimes branched stems and reduced leaf structure compared to the typical form of H. vulgatum."
