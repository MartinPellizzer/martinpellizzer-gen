    "intro": "Heracleum longilobum, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, umbrella-shaped white flowers and deeply lobed, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant contains phototoxic sap that can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. It is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as riverbanks and roadsides. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
