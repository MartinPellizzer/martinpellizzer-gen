    "intro": "Hemionitis aurea, commonly known as the golden flax or golden hemionitis, is a rare and unique fern native to the arid regions of China. It is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow foliage, which contrasts sharply with its slender, wiry stems. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and has adapted to extreme environmental conditions. Its fronds are typically small and narrow, often curling into a rosette shape for moisture retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis aurea is considered a rare and endangered species."
