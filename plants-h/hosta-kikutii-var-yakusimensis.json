It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are a deep, dark green with a subtle metallic sheen. The foliage often has a waxy texture and can exhibit slight variegation in some cultivars. This plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is well-suited for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes primarily from its lush, textured foliage rather than its flowers."
