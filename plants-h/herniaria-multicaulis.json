    "intro": "Herniaria multicaulis, commonly known as the many-stemmed bladderwort, is a small, mat-forming plant that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing structure with numerous short, branching stems. The plant produces tiny, bladder-like structures called pseudobracts, which are often mistaken for true flowers. These pseudobracts are typically green or reddish in color and contain specialized cells that can trap small aquatic organisms. Herniaria multicaulis is commonly found in coastal areas and is adapted to harsh, salty environments."
