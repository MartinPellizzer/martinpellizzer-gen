    "intro": "Hilliella rupicola subsp. shuangpaiensis, commonly known as the Shuangpai hilliella, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and succulent leaves that are adapted to arid and rocky environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
