    "intro": "Horridocactus andicola var. robustus, commonly known as the robust horridocactus, is a species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a cactus characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and spiny, cylindrical structures that provide protection from herbivores. The plant thrives in high-altitude, rocky environments with well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, bloom in late summer and attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
