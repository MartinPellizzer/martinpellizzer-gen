    "intro": "Hartia multinerva, commonly known as the African star grass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves with a fibrous, rhizomatous root system. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in spikelets, which are borne on slender, branching stalks. Hartia multinerva is often found in open grasslands and along riverbanks, thriving in well-drained soils. Its fibrous roots make it an important plant for erosion control and livestock forage."
