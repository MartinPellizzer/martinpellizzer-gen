    "intro": "Helleborine succulenta, commonly known as the succulent helleborine, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Native to certain regions of Africa and the Middle East, it thrives in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
