It features a rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves with a distinctive zebra-like pattern of light and dark green markings. The leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to store water in arid environments. It produces small, star-shaped white flowers on slender stems during the growing season. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires minimal watering, making it ideal for indoor cultivation."
