It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
