    "intro": "Helleborine palustris lusus ochroleuca, commonly known as the marsh helleborine, is a species of orchid native to wetland habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in peat bogs and damp woodlands. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its ability to form mycorrhizal associations with fungi. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
