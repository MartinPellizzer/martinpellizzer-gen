It thrives in dry, rocky, and sandy soils, often found in coastal and inland arid regions. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is noted for its resilience to harsh environmental conditions, making it a hardy species in Mediterranean climates."
