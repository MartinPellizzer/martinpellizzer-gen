    "intro": "Heterostigma, commonly known as the \"spleenwort,\" is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, delicate fronds and are typically found growing on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. Heterostigma species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic. Their reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered in specialized areas called sori, which are often located on the underside of the fronds. The genus includes several species, such as *Heterostigma tenuifolium*, which is notable for its intricate leaf morphology and ecological adaptability."
