    "intro": "Hieracium bupleuroides subsp. arcuatum, commonly known as the bent-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrowly lance-shaped leaves that curve outward, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in a single inflorescence at the end of each stem, which typically bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and roadsides. The species is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and medicinal properties in some species."
