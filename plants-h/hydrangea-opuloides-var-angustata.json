It features narrow, elongated leaves that are typically dark green and turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its foliage color and the gradual change in flower color depending on soil pH."
