    "intro": "Hieracium pellitum subsp. pseudolaggeri, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant features basal rosettes of leaves that are lanceolate and covered in fine, white hairs. Its flowering stems produce yellow composite flowers, which are composed of numerous small florets arranged in a discoid head. This subspecies is characterized by its relatively small size and distinctive leaf morphology compared to other hawkweed species."
