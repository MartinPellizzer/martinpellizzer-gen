    "intro": "Hymenodictyon, commonly known as the \"corkwood\" or \"barkwood,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Olacaceae. These plants are characterized by their woody stems and distinctive, often fragrant flowers. Hymenodictyon species are typically shrubs or small trees, native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. Their leaves are usually simple and alternate, with a rough or hairy texture. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal."
