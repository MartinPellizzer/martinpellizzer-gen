    "intro": "Hubera mossambicensis, commonly known as the Mozambique hubera, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, acrocarpous moss that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth form with tightly packed leaves that are usually curved and have a narrow, lanceolate shape. Its sporophytes are relatively short, with a single, elongated capsule that opens by a longitudinal slit. This moss is adapted to humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa."
