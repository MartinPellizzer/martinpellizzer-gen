    "intro": "Hymenophyllum unilaterale, commonly known as the one-sided moss, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is a small, delicate plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in width. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees and rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its fronds are usually unbranched and have a distinctive, linear shape. Hymenophyllum unilaterale thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
