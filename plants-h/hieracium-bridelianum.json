    "intro": "Hieracium bridelianum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, with hairy stems and basal leaves. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native vegetation and is considered a weed in agricultural areas."
