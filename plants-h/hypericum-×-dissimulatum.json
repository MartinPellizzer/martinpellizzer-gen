    "intro": "Hypericum \u00d7 dissimulatum, commonly known as the creeping St. John's wort, is a hybrid plant that combines traits from its parent species, Hypericum perforatum and Hypericum patulum. It is a low-growing shrub with trailing stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are oval and slightly hairy, and they emit a faintly aromatic scent. Hypericum \u00d7 dissimulatum is often found in disturbed soils and is used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil."
