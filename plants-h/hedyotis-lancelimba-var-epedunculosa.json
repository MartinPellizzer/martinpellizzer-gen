It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. This variant is distinguished by its shorter peduncles compared to the typical form of Hedyotis lancelimba. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
