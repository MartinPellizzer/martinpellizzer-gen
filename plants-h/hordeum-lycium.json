    "intro": "Hordeum lycium, commonly known as wild barley, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a rough texture, and it produces both male and female flowers on the same plant. Hordeum lycium is an important forage plant and has been used in traditional agriculture and herbal medicine."
