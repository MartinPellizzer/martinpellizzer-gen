    "intro": "Hieracium rohacsense subsp. cernaeglavae, commonly known as the Cernaeglava hawkweed, is a rare flowering plant native to the Balkans. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellowish-orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
