    "intro": "Hepetis lehmannii, commonly known as Lehmann's bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats such as meadows and slopes. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
