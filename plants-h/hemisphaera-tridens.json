    "intro": "Hemisphaera tridens, commonly known as the three-toothed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest aquatic prey such as small invertebrates. The plant has a rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its often-dry environments. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, with three lobes that give it its common name. Hemisphaera tridens plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling insect populations and serving as a food source for certain invertebrates."
