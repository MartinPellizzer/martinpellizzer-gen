    "intro": "Hieracium sisymbrellum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows. It has basal leaves that are often lobed and covered in fine hairs. Hieracium sisymbrellum is native to Europe but has been introduced to other parts of the world, where it can sometimes become invasive."
