    "intro": "Hydroglossum cubense, commonly known as the Cuban water bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic conditions. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often floating on the water's surface. Hydroglossum cubense plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
