    "intro": "Helianthemum ledifolium var. thibaudii, commonly known as the Thibaudii stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to southern Europe. It features dense clusters of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a slightly woolly texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a bright touch to rocky or gravelly landscapes. It is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and coastal gardens."
