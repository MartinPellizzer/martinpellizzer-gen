    "intro": "Helleborus lividus nothosubsp. sternii, commonly known as the pale hellebore, is a rare and unique hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its pale green to bluish foliage and its distinctive, waxy flowers that range from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Its flowers bloom in late winter or early spring, making it one of the earliest flowering plants in the Helleboraceae family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
