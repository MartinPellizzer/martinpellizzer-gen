    "intro": "Hymenophyllum peltatum var. achalense, commonly known as the Achalense Fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is native to tropical regions of South America. The plant features small, closely spaced leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of rhizomes, which help anchor it to moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. This variety is often found in humid, shaded areas such as rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appearance."
