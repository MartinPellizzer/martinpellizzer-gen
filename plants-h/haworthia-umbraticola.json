It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or pale markings. The leaves are often tinged with red or purple at the base, especially when exposed to bright light. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the growing season. This plant thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for indoor cultivation."
