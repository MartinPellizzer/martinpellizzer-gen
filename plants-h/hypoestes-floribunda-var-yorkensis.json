    "intro": "Hypoestes floribunda var. yorkensis, commonly known as the Yorkensis Hypoestes, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant, bi-color foliage, often featuring striking combinations of red, white, and green. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in clusters, typically in shades of pink or white, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for container gardening. Due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance, it is widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions."
