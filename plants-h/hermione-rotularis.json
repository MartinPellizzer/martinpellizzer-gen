    "intro": "Hermione rotularis, commonly known as the parchment fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the temperate rainforests of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds that resemble parchment, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires consistent humidity and well-draining soil. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Hermione rotularis is considered a conservation concern."
