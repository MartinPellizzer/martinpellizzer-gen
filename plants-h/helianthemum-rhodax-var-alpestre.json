    "intro": "Helianthemum rhodax var. alpestre, commonly known as the alpine everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a member of the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense covering of small, white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, rounded fruits called achenes, which are often covered in silky hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in alpine gardens."
