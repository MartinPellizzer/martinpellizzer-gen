It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically have five to seven petals. The plant produces a distinctive calyx that is broader than the typical hibiscus calyx, giving it its scientific name. Hibiscus platycalyx thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can be found in gardens and natural habitats across its native range."
