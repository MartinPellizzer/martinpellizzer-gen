It features small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery bloom, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular plant in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
