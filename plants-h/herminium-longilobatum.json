    "intro": "Herminium longilobatum, commonly known as the long-lipped twayblade, is a perennial orchid native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is part of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and exhibits a unique symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Its flowers have a distinctive elongated lip, which is a key feature in its classification. Herminium longilobatum typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in association with other orchid species."
