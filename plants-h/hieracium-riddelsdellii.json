    "intro": "Hieracium riddelsdellii, commonly known as Riddelsdell's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces yellow ray florets surrounded by tubular disk florets, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Hieracium riddelsdellii is also known for its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its native environment."
