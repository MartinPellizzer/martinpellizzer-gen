    "intro": "Herniaria ciliolata subsp. robusta, commonly known as the robust herniaria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, rounded leaves that are densely covered with fine hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or rocky habitats. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy, ornamental plant suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
