    "intro": "Heterocaryum, commonly known as the ghost tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its unique, often pendulous, and sometimes translucent leaves that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant is native to parts of Africa and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Heterocaryum species typically have small, inconspicuous flowers and produce capsule-like fruits. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
