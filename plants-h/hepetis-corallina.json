    "intro": "Hepetis corallina, commonly known as the coral heath, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Hepetis corallina is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry conditions."
