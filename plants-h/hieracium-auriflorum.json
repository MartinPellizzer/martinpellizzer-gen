    "intro": "Hieracium auriflorum, commonly known as the golden hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its bright yellow flowers, which resemble a cluster of small sunflowers, bloom from late spring to early autumn. Hieracium auriflorum is known for its hairy leaves and is sometimes considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habits."
