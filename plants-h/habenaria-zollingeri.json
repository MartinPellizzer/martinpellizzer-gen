    "intro": "Habenaria zollingeri, commonly known as the Zollinger's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant has a slender, rhizomatous stem and produces small, greenish-yellow to white flowers with three sepals and three petals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
