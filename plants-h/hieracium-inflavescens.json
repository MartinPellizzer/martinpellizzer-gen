    "intro": "Hieracium inflavescens, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
