It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
