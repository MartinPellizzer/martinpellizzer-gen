    "intro": "Hydrocotyle dentata, commonly known as the marsh mallow or water pennywort, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Araliaceae family. It is characterized by its finely toothed leaves that are often floating or semi-submerged in wet environments. The plant typically grows in shallow water, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and are followed by small, round berries. Hydrocotyle dentata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
