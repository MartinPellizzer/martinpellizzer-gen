    "intro": "Hieracium cirsiopsis, commonly known as the lesser hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. Hieracium cirsiopsis is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
