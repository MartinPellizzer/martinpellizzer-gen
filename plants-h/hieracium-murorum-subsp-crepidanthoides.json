    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. crepidanthoides, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and thrives in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are generally lanceolate, with a rough texture, and the flowers are yellow, arranged in a single head. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive spreading habit."
