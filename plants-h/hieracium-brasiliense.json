    "intro": "Hieracium brasiliense, commonly known as Brazilian hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and disturbed soils, exhibiting a creeping growth habit with rhizomes. Its yellow flowers are surrounded by pale green ray florets, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium brasiliense is often considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range."
