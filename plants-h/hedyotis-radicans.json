    "intro": "Hedyotis radicans, commonly known as creeping beggarticks, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Americas. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Hedyotis radicans is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
