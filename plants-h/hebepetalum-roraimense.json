It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, adapted for pollination by specific insect species. It thrives in the nutrient-poor soils of high-altitude rock formations, showcasing remarkable adaptations to its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
