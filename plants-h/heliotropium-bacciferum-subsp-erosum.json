    "intro": "Heliotropium bacciferum subsp. erosum, commonly known as the sticky heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, and its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. The subspecies is distinguished by its sticky secretions on the stems and leaves, which give it its common name."
