    "intro": "Huperzia mannii, commonly known as the rock huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its simple, linear leaves that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Huperzia mannii is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it a common sight in montane regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are located on the underside of the leaves, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
