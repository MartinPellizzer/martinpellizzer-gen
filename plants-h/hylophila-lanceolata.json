    "intro": "Hylophila lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are adapted for life in freshwater environments. The plant typically grows in slow-moving streams and marshy areas, where it thrives in moist, shaded conditions. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that release spores for propagation. Hylophila lanceolata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to water quality maintenance."
