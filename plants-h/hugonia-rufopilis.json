    "intro": "Hugonia rufopilis, commonly known as the red-stemmed umbrella plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It features distinctive, umbrella-like clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and its stems are reddish in color, which gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Hugonia rufopilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
