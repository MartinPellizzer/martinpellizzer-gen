It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces striking yellow to orange flowers with prominent, horn-like structures at the base of the petals. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Hesperis hispida is a member of the Papaveraceae family, which includes other well-known genera such as Papaver and Corydalis."
