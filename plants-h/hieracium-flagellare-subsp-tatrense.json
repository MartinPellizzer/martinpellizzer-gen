    "intro": "Hieracium flagellare subsp. tatrense, commonly known as the Tatran Hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high alpine regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and grassy habitats at elevations above 1,500 meters. It has a rosette of basal leaves and produces flowering stems that bear small, clustered flowers. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
