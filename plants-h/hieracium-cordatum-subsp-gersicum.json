    "intro": "Hieracium cordatum subsp. gersicum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves and its tall, leafless stems that bear clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are typically visited by a variety of pollinators, including bees and flies. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller leaves and shorter flowering stems compared to other members of the Hieracium genus."
