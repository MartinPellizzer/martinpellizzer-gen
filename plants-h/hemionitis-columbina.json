    "intro": "Hemionitis columbina, commonly known as the mountain hemlock, is a small evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-elevation environments. Hemionitis columbina is well adapted to harsh, alpine conditions and plays a vital role in stabilizing mountainous terrain."
