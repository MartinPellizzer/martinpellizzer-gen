    "intro": "Haplopappus stolonifer var. genuinus, commonly known as the sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features a mat-forming growth habit with creeping stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across arid and semi-arid landscapes. The plant has small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense heads, and it produces slender, bract-like structures called pappus. It is adapted to dry conditions, with silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight and reduces water loss. This species is often found in sandy soils and is used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
