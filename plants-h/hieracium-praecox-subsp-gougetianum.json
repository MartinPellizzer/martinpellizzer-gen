    "intro": "Hieracium praecox subsp. gougetianum, commonly known as the early hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It has finely divided, serrated leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the summer. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems."
