    "intro": "Hedera cuneata, commonly known as the Italian ivy, is a species of climbing plant belonging to the Araliaceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are typically heart-shaped or wedge-shaped, with a pointed tip. Native to southern Europe, it thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for ground cover or as a climbing plant. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by dark blue berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a popular ornamental plant and an invasive species in some regions."
