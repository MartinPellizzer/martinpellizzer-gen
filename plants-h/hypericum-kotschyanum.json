    "intro": "Hypericum kotschyanum, commonly known as the Kotschyan's St. John's Wort, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its medicinal properties, similar to other St. John's wort species, have been studied for their potential therapeutic uses."
