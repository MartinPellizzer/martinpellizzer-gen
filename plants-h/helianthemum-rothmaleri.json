It is a low-growing perennial shrub with small, fleshy leaves adapted to arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
