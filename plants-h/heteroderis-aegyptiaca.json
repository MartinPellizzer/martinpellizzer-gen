    "intro": "Heteroderis aegyptiaca, commonly known as the Egyptian root knot nematode, is a parasitic nematode that primarily affects the roots of various crops. It belongs to the family Heteroderidae and is characterized by its ability to form galls on the roots of host plants. The female nematodes are typically larger than males and have a distinctive swollen body with a conical tail. This species is widely distributed in warm climates and is a significant agricultural pest due to its impact on plant growth and yield. Its life cycle involves several stages, including egg, four juvenile stages, and adult stages, with the females remaining attached to the roots throughout their adult life."
