    "intro": "Hieracium macropannosum, commonly known as the large-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a distinctive central disc. Hieracium macropannosum is known for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes, making it both a common wildflower and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
