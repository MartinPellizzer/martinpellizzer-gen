    "intro": "Haworthia viscosa subsp. nigra, commonly known as the black-stemmed Haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped growth habit and dark green, fleshy leaves with a waxy coating. The leaves are often adorned with white or pale markings, which provide a striking contrast against the dark foliage. It produces small, white or pale green flowers on tall, slender stalks during the cooler months. This species is well-suited for rock gardens and container growing due to its low maintenance requirements and unique appearance."
