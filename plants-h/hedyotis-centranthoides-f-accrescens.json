    "intro": "Hedyotis centranthoides f. accrescens, commonly known as the creeping woodruff, is a variant of the woodruff plant characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit. It is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant features small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This form is notable for its ability to form dense mats, making it a useful plant for ground cover in woodland gardens."
