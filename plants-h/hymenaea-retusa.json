    "intro": "Hymenaea retusa, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and striking red, woody fruits that contain up to 20 edible seeds, known as Brazil nuts. The tree can grow up to 50 meters tall and has a long lifespan, often living over 100 years. Its flowers are small and yellow, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. The tree plays a vital role in the rainforest ecosystem and is economically significant for its valuable nuts."
