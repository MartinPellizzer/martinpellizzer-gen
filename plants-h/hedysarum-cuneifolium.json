    "intro": "Hedysarum cuneifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sweetclover, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are narrow and lance-shaped, and its cylindrical, yellowish flower clusters that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Hedysarum cuneifolium has a deep root system that helps stabilize soil and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
