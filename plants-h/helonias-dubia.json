    "intro": "Helonias dubia, commonly known as the purple pitcher plant, is a striking carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, urn-shaped leaves that trap insects. The leaves are typically green with a deep purple hue, and they secrete a sticky liquid to lure prey. This plant thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and swamps. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
