    "intro": "Hechtia chichinautzensis, commonly known as the Chichinautzin hechtia, is a striking bromeliad native to the highlands of central Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, adding a dramatic visual contrast. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
