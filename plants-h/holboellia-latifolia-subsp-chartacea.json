It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are notable for their papery texture, which gives the species its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
