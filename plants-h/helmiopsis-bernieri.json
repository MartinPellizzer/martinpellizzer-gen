    "intro": "Helmiopsis bernieri, commonly known as the velvetleaf helmiopsis, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and it is typically found in moist, shaded environments. Its roots are fibrous and can form a dense network, helping to stabilize soil in its native habitat. Helmiopsis bernieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated in some regions for its unique foliage."
