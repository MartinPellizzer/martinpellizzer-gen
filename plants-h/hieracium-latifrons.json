    "intro": "Hieracium latifrons, commonly known as the broad-fronded hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. Its leaves are broadly lance-shaped with rough, hairy surfaces, and its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Hieracium latifrons is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habits and ability to colonize various habitats."
