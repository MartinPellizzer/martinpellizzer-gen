    "intro": "Hyptis kramerioides, commonly known as Brazilian hyptis, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a rough texture and a strong, mint-like scent. It produces small, tubular flowers in clusters, typically in shades of purple or white, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Hyptis kramerioides is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
