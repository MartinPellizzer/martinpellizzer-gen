    "intro": "Hoya gretheri, commonly known as the \"Wax Plant\" or \"Porcelain Flower,\" is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and clusters of waxy, star-shaped flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid tropical environments. Hoya gretheri produces fragrant blooms in shades of white, pink, and red, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its slow growth and low maintenance requirements make it an appealing plant for both novice and experienced growers."
