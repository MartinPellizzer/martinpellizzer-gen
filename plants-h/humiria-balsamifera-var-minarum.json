It is characterized by its aromatic, resinous leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces a sticky, balsam-like substance from its glandular surfaces, which contributes to its medicinal uses. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the understory of tropical forests. Its botanical features make it valuable in both traditional medicine and ecological studies."
