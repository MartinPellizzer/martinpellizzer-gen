    "intro": "Hieracium superbum, commonly known as the showy hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its showy yellow flowers are surrounded by pale green ray florets, and it produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Hieracium superbum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
