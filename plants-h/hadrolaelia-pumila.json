It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky or alpine environments. The plant features a compact, low-growing habit with narrow leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink. It is known for its resilience to cold and harsh conditions, making it a hardy choice for alpine gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
