It is characterized by its large, brightly colored, spiraling bracts that enclose its small, clustered flowers. The plant belongs to the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, and is often found in humid lowland forests. Its inflorescence is notable for its striking red and orange hues, which attract pollinators such as birds and bats. The leaves are broad, elongated, and often have a waxy texture, adapted to thrive in the warm, moist environments of its native habitat."
