    "intro": "Haworthia truncata var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf Haworthia, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, triangular leaves with a pale green to bluish-gray coloration, often marked by white or pale markings. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the growing season. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or container cultivation. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
