    "intro": "Haxtonia viscosa, commonly known as the sticky haxtonia, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems that are often covered in a sticky, resinous substance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a glandular surface that contributes to its sticky texture. Haxtonia viscosa is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
