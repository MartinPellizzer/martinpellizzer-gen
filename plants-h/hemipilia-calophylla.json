    "intro": "Hemipilia calophylla, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow and orange flowers that resemble flames, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, greenish-brown pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Hemipilia calophylla is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
