    "intro": "Hesperis linearis, commonly known as the linear sweet rocket, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are hairy to the touch. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Hesperis linearis is also valued for its nectar-rich flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
