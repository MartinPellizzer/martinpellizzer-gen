    "intro": "Heliotropium undulatum var. tuberculosum, commonly known as the woolly heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically purple or pink in color, often arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed soils. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage and floral display."
