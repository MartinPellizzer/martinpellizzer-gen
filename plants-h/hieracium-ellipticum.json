    "intro": "Hieracium ellipticum, commonly known as the elliptic hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant features erect, hairy stems and basal leaves that are elliptic in shape, giving it its common name. Its flowers are yellow and clustered in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the dandelion family. It is often considered a weed but has ecological value as a food source for certain insects."
