    "intro": "Hoehnea parvula, commonly known as the small-leaved hoehnea, is a small shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its fruits are follicles that release tiny seeds upon maturity. Hoehnea parvula is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas."
