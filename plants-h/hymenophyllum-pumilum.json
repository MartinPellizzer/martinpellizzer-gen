    "intro": "Hymenophyllum pumilum, commonly known as the minute shield fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like foliage and tiny, shield-shaped fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Hymenophyllum pumilum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or terrariums."
