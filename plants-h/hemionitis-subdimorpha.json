    "intro": "Hemionitis subdimorpha, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a rare and unique fern native to the high altitudes of Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the leaves. Hemionitis subdimorpha thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
