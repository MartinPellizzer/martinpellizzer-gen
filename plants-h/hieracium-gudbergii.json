It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, and it produces yellow or orange flowers that attract pollinators. Hieracium gudbergii has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and can reach heights of up to 30 centimeters. It is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
