It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that resemble miniature sunflowers. The plant produces small, papery bracts that give it a distinctive appearance, often mistaken for petals. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Helichrysum ingomense is also valued for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
