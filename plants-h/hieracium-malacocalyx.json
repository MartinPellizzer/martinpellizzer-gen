It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are bright yellow with purple-tinted bracts. Hieracium malacocalyx is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
