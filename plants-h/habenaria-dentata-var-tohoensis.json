    "intro": "Habenaria dentata var. tohoensis, commonly known as the Toho orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
