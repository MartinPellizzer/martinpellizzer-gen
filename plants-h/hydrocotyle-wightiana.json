    "intro": "Hydrocotyle wightiana, commonly known as the Indian water shield, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes and shallow water bodies. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are usually floating or partially submerged, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. Hydrocotyle wightiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
