It features dense, basal foliage that is typically green to reddish in color, with heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in spring, which are borne on slender, erect stems. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage and early blooming habit."
