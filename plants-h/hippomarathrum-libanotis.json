    "intro": "Hippomarathrum libanotis, commonly known as the Lebanon hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or arid soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the autumn. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated edge. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
