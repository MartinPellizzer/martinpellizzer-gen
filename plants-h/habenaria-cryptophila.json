    "intro": "Habenaria cryptophila, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic, and relies on atmospheric moisture and nutrients. Its roots are specialized for absorbing water and nutrients from the air, making it highly adapted to humid environments. Due to habitat destruction and its low reproductive rate, Habenaria cryptophila is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation programs."
