    "intro": "Hyacinthus dalmaticus, commonly known as the Dalmatian hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It produces clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers in early spring, typically between March and April. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves that emerge from a bulb and are often mistaken for grass. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and ability to naturalize over time."
