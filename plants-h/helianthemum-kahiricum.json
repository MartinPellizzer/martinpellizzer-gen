    "intro": "Helianthemum kahiricum, commonly known as the Kahiric sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its rocky or sandy habitat. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Helianthemum kahiricum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
