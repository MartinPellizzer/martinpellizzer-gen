    "intro": "Hymenogyne glabra subsp. glabra, commonly known as the smooth hymenogyne, is a rare and understudied plant species native to Southeast Asia. It is a small shrub characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and environmental changes."
