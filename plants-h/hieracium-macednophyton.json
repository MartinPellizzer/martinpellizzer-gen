    "intro": "Hieracium macednophyton, commonly known as the Macedonian hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit and produces yellow flowers with ray florets. The plant typically grows in sunny, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It has hairy stems and leaves that are often glandular, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
