    "intro": "Homoglossum lucidior, commonly known as the shining leaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elongated leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or near streams. Its rhizome is creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value."
