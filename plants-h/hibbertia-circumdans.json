    "intro": "Hibbertia circumdans, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Hibbertia circumdans is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal regions and dry sclerophyll forests. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly honeyeaters, due to their nectar-rich nature."
