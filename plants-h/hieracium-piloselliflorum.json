    "intro": "Hieracium piloselliflorum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in a single inflorescence. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grassy areas. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread vegetatively. Hieracium piloselliflorum is generally considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its invasive tendencies."
