    "intro": "Hymenocallis adnata var. driandrina, commonly known as the Driandina spider lily, is a species native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, funnel-shaped white flowers with prominent yellow stamens, which bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with strap-like, dark green leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for tropical gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its nocturnal fragrance, which attracts pollinators such as moths."
