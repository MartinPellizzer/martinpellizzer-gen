    "intro": "Hieracium diffusatum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and its leaves are usually alternate and toothed. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. Hieracium diffusatum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
