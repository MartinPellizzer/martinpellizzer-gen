    "intro": "Harpalyce greuteri, commonly known as the desert harpalyce, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy pods, which aid in dispersal by wind and animals. Harpalyce greuteri plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
