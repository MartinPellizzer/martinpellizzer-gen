    "intro": "Hymenophyllum paniense, commonly known as the Panam\u00e1 fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Hymenophyllum paniense is known for its intricate leaf venation and is often found in cloud forests and rainforests."
