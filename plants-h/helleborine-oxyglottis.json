    "intro": "Helleborine oxyglottis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and its striking, hooded flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia and thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with purple markings, and it produces small, dark brown seeds within a capsule. Helleborine oxyglottis is notable for its ability to hybridize with other orchid species, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
