    "intro": "Hedysarum gmelinii var. lineiforme, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often with a trailing or climbing habit. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its trifoliate leaves are pinnate, with three leaflets that are ovate to elliptic in shape. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
