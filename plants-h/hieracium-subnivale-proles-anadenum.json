    "intro": "Hieracium subnivale proles anadenum, commonly known as the snow-veiled hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to the alpine regions of Europe, this plant thrives in cold, moist environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native habitat."
