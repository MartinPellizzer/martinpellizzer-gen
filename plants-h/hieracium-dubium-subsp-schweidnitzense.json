    "intro": "Hieracium dubium subsp. schweidnitzense, commonly known as the Schweidnitz's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and sandy soils. It has finely divided, grass-like leaves and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in parts of its range."
