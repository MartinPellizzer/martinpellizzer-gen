    "intro": "Hieraciodes depressa, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in loose, sandy soils. Hieraciodes depressa is often found in disturbed sites and is considered a characteristic species of desert scrub ecosystems."
