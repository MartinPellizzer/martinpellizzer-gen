    "intro": "Hieracium amplexicaule subsp. atlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic groundsel, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. It has a short flowering period and is adapted to withstand salty air and strong winds. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
