    "intro": "Haworthia polyphylla, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are often marked with white or yellow stripes, resembling a zebra's pattern. The plant thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. Haworthia polyphylla is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
