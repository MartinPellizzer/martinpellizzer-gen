    "intro": "Hedysarum comosum, commonly known as the golden peavine, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Hedysarum comosum is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
