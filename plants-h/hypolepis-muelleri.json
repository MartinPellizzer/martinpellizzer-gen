    "intro": "Hypolepis muelleri, commonly known as the M\u00fcller's shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive shield-shaped appearance on the underside. Hypolepis muelleri thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
