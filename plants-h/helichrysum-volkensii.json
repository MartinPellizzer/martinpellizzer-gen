    "intro": "Helichrysum volkensii, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, yellow-orange inflorescences that resemble small suns, which remain intact even after flowering, giving it a long-lasting appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its foliage is usually gray-green, with narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss. Helichrysum volkensii is often used in floral arrangements due to its vibrant color and durability."
