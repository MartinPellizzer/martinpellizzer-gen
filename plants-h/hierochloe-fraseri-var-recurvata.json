    "intro": "Hierochloe fraseri var. recurvata, commonly known as Fraser's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths on rocky or gravelly soils, often found in alpine and subalpine regions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often curled or twisted, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually clustered in dense spikes, and it reproduces primarily through tillering. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
