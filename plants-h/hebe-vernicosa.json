    "intro": "Hebe vernicosa, commonly known as the silver hebe, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its silver-gray, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of violet or blue during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Hebe vernicosa is relatively low maintenance and resistant to pests and diseases, contributing to its widespread cultivation."
