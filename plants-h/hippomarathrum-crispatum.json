    "intro": "Hippomarathrum crispatum, commonly known as the fringed billygoat-weed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features narrow, hairy leaves that are often curled or fringed, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread across open areas."
