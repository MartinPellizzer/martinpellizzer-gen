    "intro": "Hyoscyamus eminens, commonly known as the tall henbane, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features erect, branched stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, covered with glandular hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in summer, followed by distinctive, ribbed, spiny fruits. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating. Hyoscyamus eminens contains tropane alkaloids, making it toxic and requiring caution in handling."
