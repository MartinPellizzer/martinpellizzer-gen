It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves with a smooth texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and horticultural interest."
