    "intro": "Hemionitis humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's hemionitis, is a rare and specialized fern native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Hemionitidaceae and is characterized by its delicate, often hairy fronds that are adapted to its cool, moist habitat. The plant typically grows in rocky or shaded areas, where it can retain moisture and avoid excessive sunlight. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing clusters, are positioned on the underside of its fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Hemionitis humbertii is considered a vulnerable species."
