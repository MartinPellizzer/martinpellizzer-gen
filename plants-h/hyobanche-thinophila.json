    "intro": "Hyobanche thinophila, commonly known as the slender cow-wheat, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are specialized to attach to host roots, forming a symbiotic relationship that allows it to absorb water and minerals. Hyobanche thinophila is often found in moist, disturbed soils across parts of Europe and Asia."
