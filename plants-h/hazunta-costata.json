    "intro": "Hazunta costata, commonly known as the ribbed hazel. It is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America, characterized by its distinctive ribbed stems and alternate, simple leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by edible, nut-like fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Hazunta costata thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cooler, high-altitude environments."
