    "intro": "Hypolepis hawaiiensis var. hawaiiensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian cliff fern, is a unique fern endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocky cliffs and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori. This fern plays an important ecological role in the native habitats of Hawaii, contributing to the region's rich biodiversity."
