It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are hairy and often have a bluish-gray hue. Its flowering stems bear clusters of small, yellow flowers with ray florets. The subspecies variidens is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and flower structure compared to other members of the species."
