It features showy, orange to yellow ray flowers surrounded by a purple to red central disk, which bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant has a robust root system and thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Helenium grande is valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
