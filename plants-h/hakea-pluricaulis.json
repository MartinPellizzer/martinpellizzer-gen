    "intro": "Hakea pluricaulis, commonly known as the multi-stemmed hakea, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and its ability to form multiple stems from the base. The plant produces cylindrical, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Hakea pluricaulis is adapted to arid environments and is often found in coastal and sandy soils."
