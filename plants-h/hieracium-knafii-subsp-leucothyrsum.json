    "intro": "Hieracium knafii subsp. leucothyrsum, commonly known as the white-centred hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellowish to orange composite flowers with a distinctive white central disk. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and potential invasiveness, it is sometimes cultivated but requires careful management."
