    "intro": "Hieracium sylvaticum subsp. frigidellum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, arranged in a single terminal head. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to high-altitude conditions with limited growing seasons."
