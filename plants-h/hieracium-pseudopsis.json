It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and hairy, while its flowers are yellow with a central disc. Hieracium pseudopsis is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
