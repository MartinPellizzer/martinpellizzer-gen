    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. subvariatum, commonly known as the variable hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow to orange composite flowers and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense mats. It has hairy stems and leaves with a serrated edge, and its flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. This subspecies is notable for its variability in leaf shape and flower color, which contributes to its common name."
