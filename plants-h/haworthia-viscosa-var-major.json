It is characterized by its compact rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The leaves are typically green with distinct white or pale markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. It produces small, yellowish flowers on tall, erect stems during the summer months. This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and attractive appearance."
