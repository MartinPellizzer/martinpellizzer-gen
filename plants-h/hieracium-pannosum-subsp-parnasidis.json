It is native to the alpine regions of Europe, particularly in the Alps and Carpathian Mountains. The plant is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers and hairy, lobed leaves. It thrives in rocky, nutrient-poor soils at high altitudes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
