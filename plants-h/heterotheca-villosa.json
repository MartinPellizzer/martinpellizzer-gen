    "intro": "Heterotheca villosa, commonly known as the hairy goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss in arid environments. Heterotheca villosa produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
