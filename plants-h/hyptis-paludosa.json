    "intro": "Hyptis paludosa, commonly known as marsh hyptis, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to swampy habitats, often forming dense mats near the water's edge. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its small, tubular flowers are typically pale blue to purple and are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Hyptis paludosa is known for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
