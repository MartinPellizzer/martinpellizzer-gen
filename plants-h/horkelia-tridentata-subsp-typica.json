    "intro": "Horkelia tridentata subsp. typica, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. The species is noted for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various desert animals."
