    "intro": "Hopea aptera, commonly known as the smooth hopea, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, often glabrous bark. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same tree. Its seeds are enclosed in woody capsules, which split open to release the seeds. Hopea aptera is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in lowland evergreen forests."
