    "intro": "Hirculus heieonastes, commonly known as the silverleaf moonbloom, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It features striking silver-green leaves with a waxy texture that reflects sunlight, aiding in its survival in high-altitude environments. The plant produces delicate, night-blooming flowers with a pale lavender hue, releasing a sweet, intoxicating fragrance under the moonlight. Its root system is fibrous and deep, allowing it to access moisture from the rocky soil. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, it is considered an endangered species."
