    "intro": "Haworthia coriacea, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped foliage with distinctive white to light green markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water, allowing the plant to thrive in arid conditions. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. Haworthia coriacea is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
