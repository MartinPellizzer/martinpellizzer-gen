    "intro": "Habenaria calcicola, commonly known as the limestone orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in calcareous soils, thriving in rocky or limestone-rich environments. The plant features a compact growth habit with a single or few upright leaves and a spike of small, greenish-white flowers. Its flowers have a distinctive three-lobed lip, which is a characteristic feature of many orchid species. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range."
