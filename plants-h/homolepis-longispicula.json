It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests. The plant features slender, branched stems and narrow, pinnately compound leaves with serrated margins. Its flowers are small and white, clustered in umbrella-like arrangements, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Homolepis longispicula is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
