    "intro": "Hesperastragalus didymocarpus, commonly known as the twin-fruit milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces distinctive, two-seeded pods that are typically brown and cylindrical in shape. It has small white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Hesperastragalus didymocarpus is adapted to harsh, dry environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils through its extensive root system."
