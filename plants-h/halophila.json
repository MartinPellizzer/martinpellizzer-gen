    "intro": "Halophila, commonly known as sea horse grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Posidoniaceae. These plants are marine halophytes, meaning they thrive in saline environments such as seagrass beds in coastal waters. They have adapted to high salinity by developing specialized structures that help regulate internal salt balance. Halophila species typically have narrow, ribbon-like leaves and produce small, yellow flowers. They play an important role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
