    "intro": "Hieracium juranum subsp. constrictifrons, commonly known as the narrow-fringed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate in shape, with hairy surfaces. Its flowers are yellow, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and are accompanied by bracts that are narrow and often tinged with red. This subspecies is characterized by its distinctive, constricted fringes on the bracts, which aid in its identification."
