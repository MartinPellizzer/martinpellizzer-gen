    "intro": "Hieracium linguatifolium, commonly known as the tongue-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the daisy family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grassy areas. Hieracium linguatifolium is generally herbaceous, with a short, fibrous root system and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
