    "intro": "Hugonia mystacina, commonly known as the water sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or saturated soils, forming dense clumps with slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale green to brownish flowers in spike-like clusters, which are often submerged or just above the water surface. Its rhizomes are extensive and help stabilize the soil, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems. Hugonia mystacina is also valued for its ability to filter water and support aquatic biodiversity."
