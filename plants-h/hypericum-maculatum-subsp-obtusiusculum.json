    "intro": "Hypericum maculatum subsp. obtusiusculum, commonly known as the spotted yellowroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features upright, branched stems covered in reddish-brown hairs, and its leaves are oval to elliptic with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers with orange markings, which bloom in early summer. Its medicinal properties have been historically recognized, though it contains toxic compounds that require careful handling. The subspecies is distinguished by its obtuse, rounded leaf tips and a more compact growth habit compared to other Hypericum species."
