    "intro": "Hamamelis dentata, commonly known as the Japanese witch hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late autumn or early winter. The plant has hairy, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. Hamamelis dentata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its astringent properties."
