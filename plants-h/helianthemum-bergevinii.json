It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has aromatic, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
