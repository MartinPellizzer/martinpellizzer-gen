    "intro": "Habranthus andersonii var. obscurus, commonly known as the dark habitant lily, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous or forested areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a basal cluster of bulbs for storage and reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
