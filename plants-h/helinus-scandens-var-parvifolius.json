    "intro": "Helinus scandens var. parvifolius, commonly known as the small-leaf climbing helinus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, trailing stems that often climb or trail along the ground. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. This species is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to spread across ground surfaces."
