    "intro": "Hibiscus tubulosus, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often with a striking contrast between the petals and the yellow throat. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves and thrives in hot, dry conditions, making it well adapted to desert environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Hibiscus tubulosus is often used in traditional medicine and is also cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant blooms."
