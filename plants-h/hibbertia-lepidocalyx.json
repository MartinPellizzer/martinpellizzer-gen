It belongs to the family Dilleniaceae and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with prominent, showy stamens, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils in open habitats, often in coastal or heathland environments. Hibbertia lepidocalyx is an erect shrub that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with hairy young shoots and a distinctive, branching structure."
