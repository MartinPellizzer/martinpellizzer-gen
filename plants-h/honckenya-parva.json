It features small, dark green leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, arranged in a dense rosette. The plant produces tiny, pink to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in elongated spikes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded woodland areas.
