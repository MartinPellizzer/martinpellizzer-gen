    "intro": "Helianthus tubiflorus, commonly known as the swamp sunflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features a robust, hairy stem that can grow up to 2 meters tall, supporting large, showy yellow-orange flower heads. The plant's leaves are alternate, rough to the touch, and have a distinctive heart-shaped base. Its flowers bloom in late summer, producing abundant seeds that are dispersed by wind. The swamp sunflower thrives in wetland habitats and is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils."
