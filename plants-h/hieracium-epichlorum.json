    "intro": "Hieracium epichlorum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and its flowering period typically occurs in the summer months. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
