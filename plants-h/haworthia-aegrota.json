    "intro": "Haworthia aegrota, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves covered in white tubercles that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for dry environments. Haworthia aegrota is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
