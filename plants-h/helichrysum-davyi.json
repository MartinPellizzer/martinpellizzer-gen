    "intro": "Helichrysum davyi, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, feathery inflorescences that resemble small golden flowers, which remain intact even after drying. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, with a grayish or silver-green coloration that helps reduce water loss. Helichrysum davyi is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting, drought-resistant qualities."
