    "intro": "Hypolepis acantha, commonly known as the saw-toothed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds with serrated edges that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
