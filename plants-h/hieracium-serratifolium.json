    "intro": "Hieracium serratifolium, commonly known as the serrated hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, serrated leaves and produces numerous yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant is perennial and often forms dense colonies, which can make it invasive in certain regions. Its botanical features make it a common subject in ecological and botanical studies."
