    "intro": "Hylodesmum podocarpum, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is native to New Zealand. It is a large evergreen tree fern that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of feather-like fronds. The plant has a rhizome that produces both roots and new shoots, allowing it to form dense colonies. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is an important component of New Zealand's native forests."
