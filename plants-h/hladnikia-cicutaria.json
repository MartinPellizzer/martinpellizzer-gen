    "intro": "Hladnikia cicutaria, commonly known as the common stinkcup, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It produces a distinctive, pungent odor, which is often described as similar to that of a skunk. The fruit is a dry, two-valved capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature."
