It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, dark blue or black berries that are dispersed by animals. This variant is notable for its slightly larger flowers compared to the typical form of Hedyotis pinifolia."
