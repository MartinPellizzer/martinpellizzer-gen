    "intro": "Hovea ramulosa, commonly known as the hairy hovea, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats. Its leaves are simple and opposite, with a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. Hovea ramulosa is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial in soil enrichment."
