    "intro": "Hymenophyllum angustifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaf filmy fern, is a member of the Hymenophyllaceae family. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks and branches in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lace-like fronds with a thin, translucent appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Hymenophyllum angustifrons is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in high humidity and indirect light."
