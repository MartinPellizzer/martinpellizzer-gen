    "intro": "Heliconia pearcei, commonly known as the red heliconia, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Heliconiaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, spadix-like inflorescence surrounded by brightly colored, petal-like bracts. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structures. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
