It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, light green leaves with distinctive white or yellowish markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant is known for its ability to store water in its leaves, making it highly drought-tolerant. It produces small, star-shaped white flowers on tall stems during the summer months. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and ease of care, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
