    "intro": "Hancornia speciosa var. gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces showy, violet-purple berries in the fall, which are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly serrated edge and turn red in the autumn. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun."
