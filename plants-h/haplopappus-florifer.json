    "intro": "Haplopappus florifer, commonly known as the clustered\u7ee2\u82b1, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Haplopappus florifer is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions."
