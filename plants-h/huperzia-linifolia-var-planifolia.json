    "intro": "Huperzia linifolia var. planifolia, commonly known as the flat-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its simple, linear leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporophytes produce spores on the underside of the leaves, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and is often found in montane regions."
