    "intro": "[WRONG START] Habenaria miggelii, commonly known as the Miguel's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the Caribbean, particularly found in Jamaica and Hispaniola. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and intricate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
