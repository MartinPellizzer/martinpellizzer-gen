    "intro": "Heliconia illustris, commonly known as the red ginger or red heliconia, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its large, brightly colored inflorescences, which are composed of numerous bracts that resemble petals. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered within the inflorescence, which serves as a nectar source for various pollinators. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental value. Heliconia illustris is often cultivated in gardens and used in floral arrangements due to its striking appearance."
