    "intro": "Haynaldia villosa, commonly known as the hairy haynaldia, is a flowering plant native to the northern regions of the Americas. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant features alternate, hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white. Its fibrous roots and rhizomes allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Haynaldia villosa is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
