    "intro": "Hakea glauca, commonly known as the silver hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces cylindrical, woody cones that contain numerous small, winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry inland regions. Hakea glauca is adapted to fire-prone environments and can resprout from its rootstock after bushfires."
