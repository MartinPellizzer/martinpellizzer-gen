    "intro": "Hypericum bacciforme, commonly known as the red-stemmed St. John's wort, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces bright orange or red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its medicinal properties have been studied, though it is less commonly used than other Hypericum species."
