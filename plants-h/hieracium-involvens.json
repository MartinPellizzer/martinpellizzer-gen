    "intro": "Hieracium involvens, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and the plant produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium involvens is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize new areas quickly."
