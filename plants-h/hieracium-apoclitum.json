    "intro": "Hieracium apoclitum, commonly known as the lesser hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in the summer months. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows and along roadsides. The plant has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread vegetatively. It is considered a weed in some regions due to its aggressive colonization of open areas."
