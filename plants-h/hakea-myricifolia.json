    "intro": "Hakea myricifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces cylindrical, red or orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and dryland gardens. Hakea myricifolia is also valued for its hardy nature and low maintenance requirements."
