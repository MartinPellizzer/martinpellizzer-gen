    "intro": "Hieracium poellianum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its yellow flowers consist of ray florets and disk florets, and it produces small, oval-shaped achenes as seeds. Hieracium poellianum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
