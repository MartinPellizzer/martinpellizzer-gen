It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in coastal or inland regions with a Mediterranean climate. Hylodesmum oxyphyllum is adapted to withstand drought and salt spray, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
