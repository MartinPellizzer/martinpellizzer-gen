    "intro": "Hakea granulifera, commonly known as the rough hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems covered in small, granular tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers in summer, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss. Hakea granulifera is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy soils."
