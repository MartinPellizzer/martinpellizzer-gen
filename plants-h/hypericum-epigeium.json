    "intro": "Hypericum epigeium, commonly known as the creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
