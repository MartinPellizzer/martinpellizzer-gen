    "intro": "Hydrangea cuneatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are often dark green with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces cone-like inflorescences that transition from white to pink or red as the season progresses. Its flowers are typically sterile, with the showy parts being the modified leaves called bracts. Hydrangea cuneatifolia prefers partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
