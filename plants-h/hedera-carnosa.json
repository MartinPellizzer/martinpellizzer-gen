    "intro": "Hedera carnosa, commonly known as the curly ivy, is a species of climbing plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, warty, and often curling leaves that give it its common name. The plant belongs to the Araliaceae family and is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in shaded environments. Its leaves are typically dark green with a slightly velvety texture, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red berries. Hedera carnosa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to cover walls and trellises."
