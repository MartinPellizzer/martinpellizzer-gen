    "intro": "Hexaptera spathulata subsp. pusilla, commonly known as the small-leafed hexaptera, is a small shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. This subspecies is adapted to shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
