    "intro": "Henriettella hondurensis, commonly known as the Honduran henriettella, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its slender, unbranched stem and pinnately compound leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests, often near streams or in humid understories. Its small, clustered flowers are followed by dark blue, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Henriettella hondurensis is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
