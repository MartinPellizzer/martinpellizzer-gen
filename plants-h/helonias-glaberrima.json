    "intro": "Helonias glaberrima, commonly known as the swamp hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features a basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are usually glabrous or nearly so. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear clusters of greenish-yellow, bell-shaped flowers. These flowers are typically pollinated by insects, and the plant thrives in moist, acidic soils. It is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds."
