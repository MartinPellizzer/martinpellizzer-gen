    "intro": "Hippocrepis multisiliquosa subvar. leiocarpa, commonly known as the white-flowered rock cress, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The subspecies leiocarpa is distinguished by its smooth, hairless fruiting bodies, which contrast with the more hairy forms of other subspecies. Its flowers typically bloom in early spring, and the plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils. It is often found in alpine or subalpine regions, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat."
