    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. multifrons, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are hairy and often lobed, with a distinctive yellow-orange flower head composed of ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is characterized by its finely divided leaves and a tendency to form dense colonies, which can make it invasive in certain environments."
