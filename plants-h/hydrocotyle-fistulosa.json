    "intro": "Hydrocotyle fistulosa, commonly known as the water pennywort, is a small aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Australia. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving waters, often forming dense mats on the surface or submerged vegetation. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in diameter, with a smooth, waxy surface. Its flowering stems produce small, white flowers that are clustered together, and it is often used in aquascaping due to its attractive appearance. Hydrocotyle fistulosa is also known for its ability to purify water by absorbing nutrients and heavy metals."
