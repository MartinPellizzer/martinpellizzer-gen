    "intro": "Hoya ruthiae, commonly known as the \"Coral Hoya,\" is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It features waxy, elliptical leaves that are often tinged with red or purple hues, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, with a subtle fragrance. Hoya ruthiae thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental beauty and relatively low maintenance requirements."
