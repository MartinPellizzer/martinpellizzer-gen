    "intro": "Heteropogon polystictus, commonly known as the spotted grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, linear leaves with a distinctive silver or whitish stripe along the midrib. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are arranged in dense clusters along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Heteropogon polystictus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
