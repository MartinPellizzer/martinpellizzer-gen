    "intro": "Hieracium trebevicianum subsp. glaucinoides, commonly known as the glaucous hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate, glaucous-green leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces yellow flower heads composed of numerous small florets, which are typically arranged in a composite structure. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in parts of its native range."
