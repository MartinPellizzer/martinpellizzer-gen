    "intro": "Haumaniastrum praealtum var. praealtum, commonly known as the tall desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
