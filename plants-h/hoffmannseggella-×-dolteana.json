    "intro": "Hoffmannseggella \u00d7 dolteana, commonly known as the hybrid hawthorn, is a naturally occurring hybrid between *Hoffmannseggella* species. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. Botanically, it exhibits traits from both parent species, making it an interesting subject for study in plant genetics and hybridization. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens and landscapes."
