It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are usually basal, with a rough texture and hairy surfaces, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a dense, clustered inflorescence. Hieracium coalescens is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes and is considered invasive in some regions."
