    "intro": "Hypericum lanuginosum, commonly known as the downy St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are composed of five petals and numerous stamens. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically valuable plant in its native habitats."
