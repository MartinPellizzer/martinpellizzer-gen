    "intro": "Hieraciodes gracilipes, commonly known as the slender leaf hieraciodes, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in temperate to subtropical climates. Its slender, lance-shaped leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
