    "intro": "Hypericum elongatum var. antasiaticum, commonly known as the long-stemmed St. John's wort, is a variant of the St. John's wort species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its medicinal properties, similar to other Hypericum species, have been historically used for their purported anti-inflammatory and antidepressant effects."
