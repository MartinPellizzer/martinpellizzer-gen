    "intro": "Horaninovia platyptera, commonly known as the flat-winged orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its unique, flattened leaf-like structures that serve as modified stems, aiding in water retention in its arid environment. The plant produces small, delicate flowers with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators, such as certain species of bees and wasps. Its growth is highly dependent on specific microclimatic conditions, making it vulnerable to environmental changes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Horaninovia platyptera is considered an endangered species."
