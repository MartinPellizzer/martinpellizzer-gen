    "intro": "Hieracium schmidtii subsp. floccosum, commonly known as the fluffy hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a tall, leafless stem that bears a dense cluster of yellow flowers. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
