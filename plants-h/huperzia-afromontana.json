    "intro": "Huperzia afromontana, commonly known as the African mountain huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its simple, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. This plant is native to the mountainous regions of eastern and southern Africa, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Huperzia afromontana is a perennial plant that often grows in dense clusters, forming low, compact mats. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the leaves, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
