    "intro": "[WRONG START] Homoia riparia, commonly known as the riverbank willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the wetlands and riverbanks of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are wind-pollinated, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Homonoia riparia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a valuable species in riparian habitats."
