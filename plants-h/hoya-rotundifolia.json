    "intro": "Hoya rotundifolia, commonly known as the \"Wax Plant\" or \"Porcelain Flower,\" is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are round or oval in shape, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink in color. Hoya rotundifolia is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light. It is also noted for its ability to produce offsets, which can be easily propagated to create new plants."
