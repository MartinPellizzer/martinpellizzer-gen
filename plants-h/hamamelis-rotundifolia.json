    "intro": "Hamamelis rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf witch-hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its oval, dark green leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces fragrant yellow or orange flowers in late autumn, which are unique for their ability to bloom when other plants are dormant. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its astringent properties. Hamamelis rotundifolia is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cold climates."
