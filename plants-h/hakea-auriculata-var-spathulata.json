    "intro": "Hakea auriculata var. spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features lanceolate to spatulate leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces dense clusters of bright red, urn-shaped flowers that are highly attractive to nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and dryland gardens. Its adaptability and ornamental value make it a popular choice for native landscaping."
