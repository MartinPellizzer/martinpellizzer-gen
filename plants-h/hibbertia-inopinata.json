    "intro": "Hibbertia inopinata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sandblush, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces yellow flowers with prominent, showy petals that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Hibbertia inopinata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
