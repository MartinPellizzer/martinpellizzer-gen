    "intro": "Hemipilia yajiangensis, commonly known as the Yajiang hemipilia, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the Yajiang region of Sichuan, China. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which bloom during the spring season. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on rocky substrates. Its morphology includes a short rhizome and a single, erect stem bearing several lance-shaped leaves. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically important for conservation efforts in its native range."
