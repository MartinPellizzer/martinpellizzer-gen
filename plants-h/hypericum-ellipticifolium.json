    "intro": "Hypericum ellipticifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has elliptical, glossy leaves that are arranged alternately along its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Its medicinal properties have been studied, though it is less commonly used than other Hypericum species."
