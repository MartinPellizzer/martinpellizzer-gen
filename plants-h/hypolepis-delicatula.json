    "intro": "Hypolepis delicatula, commonly known as the slender shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or drooping. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds. Hypolepis delicatula is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
