It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are orbicular, meaning they are round or nearly round in shape, and are covered in fine hairs. This plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting flowers."
