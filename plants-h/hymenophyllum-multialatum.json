    "intro": "Hymenophyllum multialatum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of moss belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are covered in a dense layer of tiny, overlapping scales. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a distinctive silver or whitish appearance due to the presence of specialized structures called hyaline cells. Hymenophyllum multialatum plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil moisture and providing habitat for microorganisms."
