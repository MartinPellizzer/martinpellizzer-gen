    "intro": "Haworthia corallina, commonly known as the coral haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact rosette of fleshy, pale green leaves with white or pinkish tubercles that resemble coral. The plant produces tall, slender stems with clusters of small, white flowers during the growing season. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor and rock garden settings."
