    "intro": "Hymenophyllum dendritis, commonly known as the tree fern spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in tiny, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Hymenophyllum dendritis is noted for its unique morphology and is often found in moist, shaded habitats across Southeast Asia and parts of Australia."
