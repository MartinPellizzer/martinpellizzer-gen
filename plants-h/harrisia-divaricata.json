It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in dense, white, woolly hair, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that ripens to a red color and is edible. Harrisia divaricata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid environments."
