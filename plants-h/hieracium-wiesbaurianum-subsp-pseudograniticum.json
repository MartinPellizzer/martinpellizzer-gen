    "intro": "Hieracium wiesbaurianum subsp. pseudograniticum, commonly known as the granitic hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy, often glandular leaves. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils, often on limestone or granitic substrates, and thrives in open, sunny habitats. It has a low, spreading growth habit with numerous flowering stems that produce small, clustered flowers. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and localized species in its native range."
