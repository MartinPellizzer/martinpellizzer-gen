    "intro": "Heisteria serpylloides, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees. Heisteria serpylloides is often used in native plant gardens for its ecological benefits and aesthetic appeal."
