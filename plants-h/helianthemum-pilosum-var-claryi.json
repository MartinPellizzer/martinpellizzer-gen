    "intro": "Helianthemum pilosum var. claryi, commonly known as the Clary's stonecrop, is a low-growing, mat-forming succulent native to southern Europe. It features small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
