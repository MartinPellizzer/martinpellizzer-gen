    "intro": "Hymenophyllum ringens, commonly known as the silver fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the Hymenophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving it a silvery appearance. This epiphytic plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Hymenophyllum ringens is valued for its ornamental beauty and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats."
