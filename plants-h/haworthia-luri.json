    "intro": "Haworthia luri, commonly known as the narrow-leafed Haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asphodelaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and fleshy. The leaves are often covered in a layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, greenish-white flowers on slender stems during the warmer months. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
