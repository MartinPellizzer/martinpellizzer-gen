    "intro": "Hylocharis scabrida, commonly known as the scabrous hylocharis, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in moist, tropical environments. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
