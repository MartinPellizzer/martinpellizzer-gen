    "intro": "Hypochaeris ciliata, commonly known as the hairy false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, thriving in disturbed soils. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by tufts of white, fluffy seeds for wind dispersal. The leaves are usually hairy and have a serrated edge, contributing to its common name."
