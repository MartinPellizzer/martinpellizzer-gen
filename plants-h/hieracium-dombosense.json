    "intro": "Hieracium dombosense, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are usually basal, with a rough texture and a slightly hairy surface, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a single, showy head. Hieracium dombosense is often found in meadows and alpine tundras, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
