    "intro": "Haworthia \u00d7 curta, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a hybrid succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves that are often marked with distinctive white or yellow stripes. The plant thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. It produces small, greenish-white flowers on tall stems during the growing season. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and rock gardens."
