    "intro": "Heracleum glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth cowparsnip, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. It produces white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. The plant is often mistaken for poison hemlock due to its similar appearance, but it is generally not toxic to humans or livestock."
