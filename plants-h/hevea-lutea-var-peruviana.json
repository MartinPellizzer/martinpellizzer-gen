It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, pale yellow bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant is known for its latex-producing capabilities, though it is less commercially significant than other Hevea species. It thrives in tropical climates and requires well-drained soil and ample sunlight. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and greenhouses."
