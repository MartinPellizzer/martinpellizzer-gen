    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum var. alpestre, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat, disc-like cluster. This variant is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth compared to other forms of Hieracium vulgatum."
