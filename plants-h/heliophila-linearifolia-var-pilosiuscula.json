It features slender, linear leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting aquatic and wetland biodiversity."
