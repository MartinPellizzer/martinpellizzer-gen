It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in humid, lowland areas. The plant is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing during the dry season. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant has a shallow root system and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat."
