    "intro": "Herpetacanthus magnobracteolatus, commonly known as the giant bract herpetacanthus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy bracts that resemble leaves, which are often mistaken for actual flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically broad and have a rough texture, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental bracts and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
