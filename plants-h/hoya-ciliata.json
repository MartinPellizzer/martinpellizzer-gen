    "intro": "Hoya ciliata, commonly known as the \"Snowy Wreath,\" is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its waxy, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Hoya ciliata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
