    "intro": "Helianthemum tuberaria var. globulariifolia, commonly known as the globular leaf sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The leaves are succulent, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps the plant conserve water in arid environments. It thrives in rocky soils and full sun, making it well adapted to coastal and limestone habitats. This variety is distinguished by its globular, rounded leaf shape, which gives it its specific epithet."
