    "intro": "Hirtella sapinii, commonly known as the Brazilian wax tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by ornamental, waxy berries that turn red when mature. Hirtella sapinii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and disturbed areas. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in tropical and subtropical regions."
