    "intro": "Helicia attenuata, commonly known as the slender helicia, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy, with a distinct tapering tip. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in inflorescences, and it produces edible, woody fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. Helicia attenuata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
