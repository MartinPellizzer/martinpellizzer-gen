    "intro": "Herpestis diffusa, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. Herpestis diffusa is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often found in coastal areas and along roadsides."
