    "intro": "Hieracium micradenum, commonly known as the small-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a hairy texture, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Hieracium micradenum is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
