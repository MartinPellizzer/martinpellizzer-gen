    "intro": "Hemizygia flabellifolia, commonly known as the flabellifoliate hemizygia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that resemble a fan, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the dry season. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
