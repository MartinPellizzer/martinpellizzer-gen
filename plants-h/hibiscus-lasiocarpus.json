It is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Hibiscus lasiocarpus is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
