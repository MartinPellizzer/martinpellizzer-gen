    "intro": "Hopea sulcata, commonly known as the Burmese ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The tree can grow up to 40 meters tall, with a straight trunk and a broad, umbrella-like canopy. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture with a prominent midrib. Hopea sulcata also produces small, fragrant flowers and spherical fruits that contain one or two seeds."
