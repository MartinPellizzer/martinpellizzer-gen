    "intro": "Hemicrambe fruticosa, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features wiry stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils. Hemicrambe fruticosa is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as cliffs and coastal areas."
