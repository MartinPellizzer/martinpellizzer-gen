    "intro": "Heterocarpha, commonly known as the marsh hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. These plants are typically found in wetland habitats, including marshes and pond edges, where they thrive in moist to aquatic conditions. The genus includes several species, such as Heterocarpha ciliata and Heterocarpha heterophylla, which are characterized by their showy, often pink or red flowers. The leaves are usually alternate, ovate, and have a smooth or hairy surface, while the stems are often herbaceous and sometimes semi-aquatic. Heterocarpha species play an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and aquatic organisms."
