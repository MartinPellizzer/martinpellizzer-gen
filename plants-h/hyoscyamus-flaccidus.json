    "intro": "Hyoscyamus flaccidus, commonly known as the flaccid henbane, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a distinct, somewhat fuzzy texture. Hyoscyamus flaccidus contains various tropane alkaloids, which contribute to its historical use in medicine and as a source of hallucinogenic substances."
