    "intro": "Himantoglossum robertianum f. candidum, commonly known as the white-flowered hare's foot orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the British Isles. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy, and often white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in damp, shaded habitats such as woodland floors and limestone grasslands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often clustered at the base, forming a rosette structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
