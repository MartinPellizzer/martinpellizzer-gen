    "intro": "Hemiphlebium petersii, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a delicate evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It features graceful, arching fronds with a soft, silvery-white underside that gives it its common name. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial to full shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming a compact clump over time. Hemiphlebium petersii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in shaded garden beds or as a container plant."
