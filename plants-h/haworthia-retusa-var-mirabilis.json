    "intro": "Haworthia retusa var. mirabilis, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves with distinctive white to light green markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor and rock garden settings."
