It is characterized by its striking, lobster-claw-shaped inflorescences that are typically bright red or orange in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers surrounded by large, fleshy bracts that serve as a lure for pollinators. Heliconia vaginalis is a member of the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is commonly found in rainforests and botanical gardens."
