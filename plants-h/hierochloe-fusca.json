    "intro": "Hierochloe fusca, commonly known as rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, wiry stems that are covered in fine, bristly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Hierochloe fusca is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
