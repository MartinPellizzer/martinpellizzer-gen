    "intro": "Homalanthus acuminatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and often showy, modified floral structures called cyathia. The plant typically has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
