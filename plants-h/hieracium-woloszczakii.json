It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in dense clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
