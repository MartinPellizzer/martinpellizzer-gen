    "intro": "Hypericum confertum, commonly known as the clustered St. John's wort, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems covered in yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its medicinal properties, similar to other Hypericum species, have been traditionally used for their purported healing benefits."
