    "intro": "Hottonia sessiliflora, commonly known as the water crown, is a aquatic plant native to North America. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense, floating mat on the water surface. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in shallow water environments. H. sessiliflora is often found in ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems."
