    "intro": "Heptacodium, commonly known as the Chinese fringeflower, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its unique, fragrant, and showy flowers that appear in late summer. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that resemble a fringe, hence its common name. Heptacodium has opposite, ovate leaves that are often red-veined and turn red in the fall. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
