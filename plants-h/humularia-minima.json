    "intro": "Humularia minima, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Humularia minima thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in the wild."
