    "intro": "Halimus pedunculatus, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and broad, waxy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the rainy season. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions. Halimus pedunculatus is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food for both wildlife and humans."
