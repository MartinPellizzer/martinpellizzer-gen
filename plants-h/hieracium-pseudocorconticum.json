    "intro": "Hieracium pseudocorconticum, commonly known as the false spearthistle, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its bracts are often reddish or purplish. It is considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its aggressive growth habit."
