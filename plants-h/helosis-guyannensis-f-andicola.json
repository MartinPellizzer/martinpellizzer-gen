    "intro": "Helosis guyannensis f. andicola, commonly known as the Andean helosis, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring small, clustered leaves and a compact growth habit adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils typical of Andean cloud forests. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for specific ecological zones. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for ecological and conservation research."
