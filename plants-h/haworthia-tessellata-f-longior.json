    "intro": "Haworthia tessellata f. longior, commonly known as the long-leaf haworthia, is a compact, succulent plant native to South Africa. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or yellowish markings, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are elongated compared to the typical form, hence the \"longior\" designation, and often form a rosette shape. It produces small, white or pale green flowers on slender stems during the warmer months. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens or indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
