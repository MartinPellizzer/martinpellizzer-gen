    "intro": "Hieracium pseudoravaudii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of California. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
