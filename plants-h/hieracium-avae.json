    "intro": "Hieracium avae, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often becoming invasive. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. Hieracium avae is known for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes and seeds, making it a challenging weed to control."
