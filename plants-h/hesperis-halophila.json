    "intro": "Hesperis halophila, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in saline environments. The plant belongs to the Brassicaceae family, also known as the mustard family, and is adapted to grow in sandy or rocky soils. Its flowers are typically arranged in racemes and bloom in late summer to early autumn. Hesperis halophila is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
