    "intro": "Haageocereus repens, commonly known as the creeping night bloomer, is a cactus native to the deserts of South America. It is a low-growing, mat-forming species with fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid conditions. Haageocereus repens is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
