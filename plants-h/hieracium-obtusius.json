    "intro": "Hieracium obtusius, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a wavy margin, and the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium obtusius is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and natural areas."
