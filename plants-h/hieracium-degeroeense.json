    "intro": "Hieracium degeroeense, commonly known as the Degeroeen hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellowish-orange composite flowers and hairy stems, typical of many hawkweeds. Native to specific regions in Europe, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and it produces small, seed-like structures called cypselae. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range."
