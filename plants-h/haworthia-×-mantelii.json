    "intro": "Haworthia \u00d7 mantelii, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a hybrid succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped foliage with distinctive white or light green markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor and rock garden settings."
