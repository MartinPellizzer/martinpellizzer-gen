    "intro": "Hoffmannia nebulosa, commonly known as the misty hoffmannia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves that are densely covered with fine hairs, giving it a frosty appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers arranged in a loose spike, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Hoffmannia nebulosa thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and drought tolerance."
