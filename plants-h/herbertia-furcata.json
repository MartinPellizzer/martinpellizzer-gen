    "intro": "Herbertia furcata, commonly known as the forked herbertia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and showy, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps in suitable habitats. Herbertia furcata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and botanical collections."
