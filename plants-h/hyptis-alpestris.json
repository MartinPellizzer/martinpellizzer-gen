It is a member of the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are often hairy and have a distinct mint-like scent, which contributes to its medicinal and aromatic uses.
