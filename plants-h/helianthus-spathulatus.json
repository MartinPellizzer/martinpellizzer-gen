    "intro": "Helianthus spathulatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sunflower, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features upright stems covered in soft, gray-green foliage, and it produces bright yellow flower heads with dark brown central disks. Its flowers are typically 5 to 8 inches in diameter, and they bloom from late spring to early summer. Helianthus spathulatus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
