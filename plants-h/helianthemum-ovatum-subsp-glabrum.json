    "intro": "Helianthemum ovatum subsp. glabrum, commonly known as the glabrous rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, typically from May to June. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are covered in a waxy coating, helping it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas. This subspecies is notable for its lack of pubescence, giving it a smooth, polished appearance."
