    "intro": "Heracleum sublineare, commonly known as narrow-leaved cow parsnip, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, pinnately divided leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its fruits are small, dry, and three-angled, typical of the Apiaceae family. Heracleum sublineare is often found in moist meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges."
