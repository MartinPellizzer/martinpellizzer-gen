    "intro": "Hieracium sulphurelliforme, commonly known as the sulphur-yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and its stems are upright with a reddish tinge. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
