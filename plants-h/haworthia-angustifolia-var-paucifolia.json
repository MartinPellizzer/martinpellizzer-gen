    "intro": "Haworthia angustifolia var. paucifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with a distinctive white or pale blue waxy coating. The leaves are narrow and pointed, often adorned with small, white tubercles along their edges. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the growing season. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements."
