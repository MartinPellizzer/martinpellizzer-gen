    "intro": "Hieracium meionexium, commonly known as the small-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its low-growing habit and ability to spread vegetatively, it can form dense colonies in suitable environments."
