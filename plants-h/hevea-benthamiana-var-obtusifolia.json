It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its latex-producing capabilities, similar to its parent species. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in genetic and biotechnological research. The varietal form exhibits slight morphological differences compared to the standard Hevea benthamiana."
