It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its striking, golden-yellow flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically arranged in a single, terminal head. Its leaves are usually linear and covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. Helichrysum difficile is known for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
