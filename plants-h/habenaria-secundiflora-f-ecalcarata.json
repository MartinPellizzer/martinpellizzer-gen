    "intro": "Habenaria secundiflora f. ecalcarata, commonly known as the spurred orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The flowers are borne in racemes and feature a unique spurred structure, which is a defining botanical trait of the species. The sepals and petals are typically greenish-white with reddish veins, adding to its ornamental appeal. This orchid thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
