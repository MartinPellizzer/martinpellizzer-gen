It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, narrow leaves. Its flowers are yellow and are followed by a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. Haplopappus elatus is often found in open areas such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe."
