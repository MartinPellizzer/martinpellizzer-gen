    "intro": "Hypericum dichotomum, commonly known as the two-branched St. John's wort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and produces bright yellow flowers in late summer. The plant has opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and woodland edges. Its medicinal properties have been historically valued, though it contains compounds that can be toxic in large quantities."
