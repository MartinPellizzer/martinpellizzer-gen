    "intro": "Helichrysum densiflorum, commonly known as the denseflower immortelle, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that are often grayish-green in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. The flowers are long-lasting and retain their color when dried, which is why it is often used in floral arrangements."
