    "intro": "Haemodorum macfarlanei, commonly known as the Macfarlane's bloodroot, is a flowering plant native to the wet tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is a small, herbaceous perennial with distinctive reddish-orange roots and dark green, glossy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It is often found growing in shaded, moist environments along streamlines and in rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
