    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracussion pohjolense, commonly known as the Pohjola hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern Finland and parts of Scandinavia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in open, moist habitats such as bogs and meadows, where it thrives in acidic soils. Its leaves are basal, spoon-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
