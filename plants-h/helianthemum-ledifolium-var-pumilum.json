    "intro": "Helianthemum ledifolium var. pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, aiding in water retention in its rocky, arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer, which are typical of the Cistaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for Mediterranean-style landscaping."
