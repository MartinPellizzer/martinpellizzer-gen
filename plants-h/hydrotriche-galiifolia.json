    "intro": "Hydrotriche galiifolia, commonly known as the marsh gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in shallow water. Its root system helps stabilize soil in marshy areas, contributing to wetland ecosystem health. Hydrotriche galiifolia is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water levels and is often found in bogs and along the edges of ponds."
