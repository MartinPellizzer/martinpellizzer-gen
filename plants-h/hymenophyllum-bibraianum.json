    "intro": "Hymenophyllum bibraianum, commonly known as the New Zealand spore moss, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks in humid forests. Its sporangia are clustered in small, cup-like structures called soruses, which are usually located on the underside of the leaves. Hymenophyllum bibraianum is known for its unique morphology and is often found in the understory of temperate rainforests."
