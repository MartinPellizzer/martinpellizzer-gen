    "intro": "Halophila kotschyanae, commonly known as the Kotschy's sea horsegrass, is a marine flowering plant belonging to the Alismataceae family. It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments such as shallow coastal waters and estuaries. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for marine organisms. Its adaptability to high salinity makes it a key species in intertidal zones."
