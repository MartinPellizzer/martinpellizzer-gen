    "intro": "Hypericum longistylum subsp. giraldii, commonly known as the long-stemmed St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in terminal cymes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves and flowers contain bioactive compounds, including hypericin and pseudohypericin, which have been studied for their potential medicinal properties. This subspecies is often found in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
