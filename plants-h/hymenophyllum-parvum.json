    "intro": "Hymenophyllum parvum, commonly known as the small filmy fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sorus. Hymenophyllum parvum plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
