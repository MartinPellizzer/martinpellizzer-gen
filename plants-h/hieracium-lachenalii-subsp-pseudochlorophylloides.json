    "intro": "Hieracium lachenalii subsp. pseudochlorophylloides, commonly known as the chlorophyllous hawkweed, is a rare and specialized plant species within the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-green foliage, which reflects its unique chlorophyll composition compared to other hawkweeds. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, preferring moist, well-drained soils in rocky or grassy habitats. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of yellow to orange, and it blooms during the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
