    "intro": "Haplopappus berteroi var. lanceolatus, commonly known as the lanceolate sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with woolly, gray-green foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped, which helps reduce water loss through transpiration. It is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, contributing to local biodiversity."
