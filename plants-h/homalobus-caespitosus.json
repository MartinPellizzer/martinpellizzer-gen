    "intro": "Homalobus caespitosus, commonly known as the rough hairpin grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and stiff, wiry leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in open grasslands and rocky soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
