    "intro": "Hosackia palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Hosackia palmeri plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
