    "intro": "Haworthia mundula, commonly known as the moonlight haworthia, is a small, compact succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating called farina. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale yellow during the cooler months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for succulent collections. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
