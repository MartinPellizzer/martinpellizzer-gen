    "intro": "Helianthemum rubellum var. subexstipulatum, commonly known as the crimson sandwort, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to southern Europe. It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red. The plant produces clusters of bright orange to red flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, hairy stalks. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Its compact size and vibrant color make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
