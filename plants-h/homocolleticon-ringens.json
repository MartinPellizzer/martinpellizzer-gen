    "intro": "Homocolleticon ringens, commonly known as the goldenrod leaf miner, is a small moth species whose larvae feed on the leaves of goldenrod plants. The adult moth has a distinctive yellowish-ochre coloration with intricate patterns on its wings. The life cycle of this species is closely tied to the blooming period of goldenrod, which typically occurs in late summer. The larvae create serpentine tunnels within the leaves, which can cause visible damage to the plant. This species plays a role in the ecological interactions of its habitat, contributing to the food web through both its herbivory and as prey for other animals."
