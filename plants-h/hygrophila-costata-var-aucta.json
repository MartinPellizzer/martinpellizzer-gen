    "intro": "Hygrophila costata var. aucta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water hyssop, is a perennial aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow water, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, and has elongated, narrow leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually blue or purple, arranged in spikes at the top of the stems. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the substrate, while its leaves provide habitat for aquatic invertebrates. This variety is often used in water gardens and wetland restoration projects due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
