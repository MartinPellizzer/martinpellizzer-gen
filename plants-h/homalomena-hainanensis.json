It features large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive arrowhead shape, typically ranging from 30 to 60 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants due to their aesthetic appeal."
