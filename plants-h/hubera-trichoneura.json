    "intro": "Hubera trichoneura, commonly known as the woolly hubera, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers its stems and leaves, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a bluish-green hue, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Hubera trichoneura is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
