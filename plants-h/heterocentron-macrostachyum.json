It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that open in the morning. The plant has a complex root system that anchors it in shallow water and supports its growth. Its flowers exhibit a distinct heterostylous structure, with stamens and pistils positioned at different levels to promote cross-pollination. This species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water organisms."
