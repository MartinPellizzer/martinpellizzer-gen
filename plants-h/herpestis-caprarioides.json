    "intro": "Herpestis caprarioides, commonly known as the creeping jenny, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its small, bright yellow flowers appear in late spring to early summer, adding a vibrant touch to the undergrowth. The leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
