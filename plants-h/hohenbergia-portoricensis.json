    "intro": "Hohenbergia portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican hohenbergia, is a species of flowering plant native to the island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy coating. The plant produces vibrant, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
