    "intro": "Hieracium dutillyanum, commonly known as the Dutilly's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and flowering heads that produce small, yellowish to reddish flowers. Native to southern Europe, it thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It is often found in disturbed areas and can be invasive in certain regions."
