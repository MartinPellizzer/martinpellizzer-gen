    "intro": "Hermione antipolensis, commonly known as the Antipolis orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Italy. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its blooming period occurs in late spring, and it is known for its unique, fragrant scent. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
