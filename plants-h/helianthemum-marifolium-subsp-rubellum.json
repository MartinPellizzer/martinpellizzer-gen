    "intro": "Helianthemum marifolium subsp. rubellum, commonly known as the red-flowered rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features compact, woody stems and small, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright red flowers during the spring and early summer, which are highly attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact size and vibrant floral display make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
