    "intro": "Hieracium badioviolaceum, commonly known as the violet-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its distinctive violet-hued leaves and yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils at high altitudes. It is a perennial herb that forms dense mats, often colonizing open meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
