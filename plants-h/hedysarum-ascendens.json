    "intro": "Hedysarum ascendens, commonly known as the climbing lappet-vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its twining stems that climb over other vegetation, often forming dense mats or small shrubs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by bean-like pods containing several seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps stabilize soil. Hedysarum ascendens is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration and as a forage plant."
