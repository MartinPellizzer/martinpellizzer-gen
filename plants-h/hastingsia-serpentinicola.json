    "intro": "Hastingsia serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine lily, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the coastal regions of California. It is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, magnesium-rich soils found on serpentine rock outcrops. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers with six petals, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense clumps. Due to its limited habitat and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
