    "intro": "Hieracium pichinchae, commonly known as the Pichincha hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its bright yellow flowers are surrounded by pale green ray florets, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
