    "intro": "Halimolobos hispidulus var. weddellii, commonly known as the Weddell's hairy lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It typically grows on bark, soil, or stone in temperate and boreal regions. Its thallus is leathery and covered with a dense layer of hyphal filaments, giving it a rough, hairy texture. The plant exhibits a pale to yellowish-green color, with distinct lobes and a wrinkled surface. It is often found in shaded, humid environments and plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its ecosystem."
