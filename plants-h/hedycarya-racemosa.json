    "intro": "Hedycarya racemosa, commonly known as the sweet pepper tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in racemes, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing edible seeds. Hedycarya racemosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
