    "intro": "Hoya carnosa, commonly known as the wax plant or sweetheart plant, is a popular epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often variegated with white or cream markings. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, waxy flowers in shades of pink, white, or red, typically blooming during the summer months. Hoya carnosa thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its slow growth and low maintenance make it an ideal choice for both novice and experienced plant enthusiasts."
