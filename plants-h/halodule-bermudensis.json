    "intro": "Halodule bermudensis, commonly known as Bermuda shoal grass, is a marine flowering plant native to the western Atlantic Ocean. It is a seagrass species that thrives in shallow, sandy-bottom habitats, particularly in the Caribbean and along the eastern coast of the United States. The plant has long, narrow leaves that grow in dense underwater meadows, providing essential habitat for various marine organisms. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing sediments and improving water quality through its extensive root system. Halodule bermudensis is also an important food source for herbivorous fish and invertebrates."
