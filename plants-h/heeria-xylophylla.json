    "intro": "Heeria xylophylla, commonly known as the coastal heeria, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round berries that are edible for some bird species. Heeria xylophylla is typically found growing on rocky outcrops and sandy soils near the coast. Its adaptability to coastal environments makes it an important component of local ecosystems."
