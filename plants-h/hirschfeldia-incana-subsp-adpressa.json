    "intro": "Hirschfeldia incana subsp. adpressa, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of North America. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to violet flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy and resilient species suited to xerophytic ecosystems."
