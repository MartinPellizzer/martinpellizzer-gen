    "intro": "Helianthemum canariense var. subglabratum, commonly known as Canary Island thrift, is a succulent shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has fleshy, lobed leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and drought tolerance."
