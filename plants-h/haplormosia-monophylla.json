    "intro": "Haplormosia monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its singular, broad leaf and its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks without deriving nutrients from its host. Its botanical structure includes a short rhizome and a single, fleshy leaf that stores water, adapting it to its humid, shaded habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a conservation concern."
