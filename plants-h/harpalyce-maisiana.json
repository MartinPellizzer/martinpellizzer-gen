It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert and scrubland environments. Harpalyce maisiana is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested."
