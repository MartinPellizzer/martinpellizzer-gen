    "intro": "Haworthia coarctata var. sampaiana, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a dense rosette of thick, fleshy leaves with distinctive white or yellow markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The leaves are typically green with a waxy texture and are arranged in a tight, compact formation. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the growing season. This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
