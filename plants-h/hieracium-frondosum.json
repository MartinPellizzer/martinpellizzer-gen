    "intro": "Hieracium frondosum, commonly known as the fronded hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are typically lobed or toothed, and its flowering heads that produce yellow ray florets. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems, supporting a variety of pollinators and invertebrates."
