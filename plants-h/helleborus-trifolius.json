    "intro": "Helleborus trifolius, commonly known as the three-leaved hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves that are typically trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, dull green to purple flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Helleborus trifolius is adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodlands and rocky soils. It is noted for its toxic properties, containing various alkaloids that can be harmful if ingested."
