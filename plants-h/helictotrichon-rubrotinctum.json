    "intro": "Helictotrichon rubrotinctum, commonly known as the red-stained grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Poaceae family. It is native to the western United States and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color, giving it its common name. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Helictotrichon rubrotinctum is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions."
