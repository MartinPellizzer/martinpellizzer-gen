    "intro": "Hieracium thyrsophorum, commonly known as the thrysothyme hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense, spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
