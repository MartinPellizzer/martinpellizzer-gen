    "intro": "Hereroa dolabriformis, commonly known as the broad-bladed grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle with small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated. Hereroa dolabriformis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in its native habitat."
