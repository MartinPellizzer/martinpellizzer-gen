    "intro": "Hymenophyllum crispatoalatum, commonly known as the wrinkled filmy fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures called trichomes, which help reduce water loss. This species is often found in humid, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
