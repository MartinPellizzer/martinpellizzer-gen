It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has basal leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs, giving it its common name. Its flowers are yellow and appear in clusters, often blooming from late spring to early autumn. Hieracium lamprophyllum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites, where it can spread aggressively through its rhizomes."
