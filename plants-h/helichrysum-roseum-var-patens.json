    "intro": "Helichrysum roseum var. patens, commonly known as the spreading helichrysum, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, compact growth with silvery-green foliage and showy, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant produces small, papery bracts that give it a distinctive, almost feathery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its drought tolerance and long-lasting blooms make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
