    "intro": "Hieracium psepharum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun. Its bright yellow flowers consist of both ray and disk florets, and it produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium psepharum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
