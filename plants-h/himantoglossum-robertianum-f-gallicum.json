    "intro": "Himantoglossum robertianum f. gallicum, commonly known as the Gallic form of the red helleborine, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Europe. It is characterized by its striking, hooded flowers that are typically a deep reddish-brown in color. This orchid thrives in shaded, moist woodland habitats, often growing on decaying wood or in rich, loamy soils. Its botanical features include long, strap-like leaves and a unique floral structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
