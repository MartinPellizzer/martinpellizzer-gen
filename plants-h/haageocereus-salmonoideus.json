It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, ribbed stems and a distinctive salmon-pink to orange coloration. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green stems. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a desirable addition to desert gardens."
