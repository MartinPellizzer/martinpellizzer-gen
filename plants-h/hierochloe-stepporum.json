    "intro": "Hierochloe stepporum, commonly known as steppe bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, steppes, and rocky soils. The plant has fine, blue-green blades and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue to purple flowers. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense, tufted growth pattern. Hierochloe stepporum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
