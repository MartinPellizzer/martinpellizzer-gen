    "intro": "Hieracium caesioides subsp. pulchellifolium, commonly known as the blue hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and tall, branched flowering stems that bear yellow to orange composite flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. It thrives in sunny, open areas such as meadows and grasslands, and it is often found in disturbed soils. The plant is noted for its showy inflorescence and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
