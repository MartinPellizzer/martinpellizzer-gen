    "intro": "Hypolytrum pahiense, commonly known as the Pahiense spikerush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, where it grows in wetland and marshy habitats. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, inconspicuous flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in protected areas."
