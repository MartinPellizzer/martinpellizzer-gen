It features slender, twining stems that can reach lengths of up to 5 meters, allowing it to climb and spread across vegetation. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with five petals, typically blooming from late autumn to spring. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly textured appearance. The species is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in suitable conditions."
