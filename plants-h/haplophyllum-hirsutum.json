It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheat and sorrel species. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish flowers in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Haplophyllum hirsutum is often found in alpine meadows and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
