It is a flowering plant native to southern Africa, characterized by its small, yellow-orange flowers that are often mistaken for daisies. The plant produces bract-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Helichrysum gracile is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
