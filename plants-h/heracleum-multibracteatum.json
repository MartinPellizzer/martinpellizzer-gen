    "intro": "Heracleum multibracteatum, commonly known as the clustered cowparni, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in late summer. The plant produces fluffy, white seed heads that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its height and foliage, it can dominate vegetation in its habitat, making it a notable species in ecological studies."
