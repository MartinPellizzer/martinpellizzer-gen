    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. punctillum, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture, and the flowers are arranged in a single head, often with a distinct central disc. The subspecies is distinguished by the presence of small, raised dots on the leaves, giving it its common name."
