    "intro": "Hymenophyllum walleri, commonly known as the wall fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in tiny, spore capsules that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Hymenophyllum walleri is known for its high degree of morphological variation, which makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
