    "intro": "Hymenophyllum brachyglossum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hymenophyllum, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are located on the underside of the fronds. This species is notable for its intricate leaf structure and is often found in rainforests across Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands."
