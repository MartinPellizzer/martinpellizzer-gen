    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. vallisiae, commonly known as the valley hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges. The plant features upright stems that are hairy and often branched, with basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, with ray florets that are usually shorter than the central disk florets. The subspecies is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences from other members of the Hieracium genus."
