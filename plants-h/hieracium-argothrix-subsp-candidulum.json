    "intro": "Hieracium argothrix subsp. candidulum, commonly known as the white-haired hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy, often silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish to white flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
