    "intro": "Hieracium subincisum var. senile, commonly known as the old man's beard, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its long, drooping stems and clusters of small yellow flowers. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its common name reflects the hairy, beard-like appearance of its seed heads that persist through the winter."
