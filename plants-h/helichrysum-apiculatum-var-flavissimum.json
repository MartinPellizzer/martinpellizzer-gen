    "intro": "Helichrysum apiculatum var. flavissimum, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a perennial flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its striking yellow to orange-pink flower heads. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are tightly packed into spherical clusters, giving it a fluffy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. The foliage is typically grey-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions."
