    "intro": "Hydrocotyle concinna, commonly known as little water shield, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. The plant has rounded, floating leaves that are usually less than 1 inch in diameter, with a smooth, waxy surface. Its small white flowers appear in clusters and bloom from late spring to early summer. Hydrocotyle concinna plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and stabilizing water surfaces."
