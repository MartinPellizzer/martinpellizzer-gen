The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense vegetation. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
