    "intro": "Haloscias scothicum, commonly known as the Scottish haloscyphus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the British Isles. It thrives in damp, calcareous soils and is often found in coastal and maritime environments. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
