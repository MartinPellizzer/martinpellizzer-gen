It is a perennial grass that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and plains. The plant has slender, hairless stalks and produces small, spike-like clusters of pale to dark green seeds. Its leaves are narrow and have a bluish-green color, and it is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Hordeum richardsonii is considered a valuable forage plant for livestock and is also of interest in ecological and agricultural research."
