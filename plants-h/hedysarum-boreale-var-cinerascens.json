    "intro": "Hedysarum boreale var. cinerascens, commonly known as the pale-flowered vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets and produces elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Hedysarum boreale var. cinerascens plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is valued for its ecological resilience."
