    "intro": "Heracleum austriacum, commonly known as the Austrian cow parsnip, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its hollow, ridged stems and compound leaves with a distinctive fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbels, which develop into small, dry fruits called schizocarps. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and in woodland edges. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
