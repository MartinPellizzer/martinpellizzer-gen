    "intro": "Helianthemum thymifolium subsp. glutinosum, commonly known as sticky rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, evergreen foliage with glandular dots that give the leaves a sticky texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a bright contrast to its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its horticultural value lies in its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators."
