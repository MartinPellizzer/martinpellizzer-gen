It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant is known for its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Helianthopsis senex is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
