It features thick, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, giving it a unique appearance. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
