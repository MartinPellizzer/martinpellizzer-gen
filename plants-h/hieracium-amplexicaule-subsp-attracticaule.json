    "intro": "Hieracium amplexicaule subsp. attracticaule, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are clasping around the stem, giving it its specific epithet *amplexicaule*. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its subspecies *attracticaule* is distinguished by its more compact growth form and slightly different leaf morphology compared to other members of the species."
