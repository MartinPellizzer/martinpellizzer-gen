It belongs to the family Nymphaeaceae and is characterized by its floating leaves and showy white flowers. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The flowers open in the early morning and close by midday, attracting various pollinators like bees and beetles."
