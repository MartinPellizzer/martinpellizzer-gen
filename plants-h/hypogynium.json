    "intro": "Hypogynium, commonly known as the basal part of the pistil in flowering plants, is a critical structure located at the base of the ovary. It serves as the attachment point for the stigma and style, playing a vital role in pollination and fertilization processes. The hypogynium is often modified to form structures such as the nectary or a receptacle, which can influence pollinator attraction. Its morphology varies among plant species and is often studied in taxonomy and evolutionary botany. Understanding the hypogynium helps in identifying and classifying flowering plants based on their reproductive structures."
