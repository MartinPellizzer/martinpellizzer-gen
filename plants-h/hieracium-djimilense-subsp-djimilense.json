    "intro": "Hieracium djimilense subsp. djimilense, commonly known as the Djimilense hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats, often at elevations above 2,500 meters. Its leaves are basal, with a rough texture and serrated edges, while its flowers are yellow with a central disc. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially vulnerable species."
