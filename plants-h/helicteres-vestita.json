It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically green with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Helicteres vestita is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as along riverbanks and in secondary forests. It has been used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
