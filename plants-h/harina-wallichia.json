    "intro": "Harina wallichia, commonly known as the Indian wheatgrass, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayas. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Harina wallichia is also valued for its potential nutritional properties, though further scientific research is needed to confirm its medicinal uses."
