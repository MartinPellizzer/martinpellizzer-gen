    "intro": "Hemionitis beitelii, commonly known as the Chinese rock fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to China. It is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that form a dense, low-growing mat. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
