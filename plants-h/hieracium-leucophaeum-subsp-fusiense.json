    "intro": "Hieracium leucophaeum subsp. fusiense, commonly known as the white-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, white-veined leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in grassy habitats, including meadows and woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
