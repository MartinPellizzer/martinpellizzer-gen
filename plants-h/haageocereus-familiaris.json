    "intro": "Haageocereus familiaris, commonly known as the desert rose, is a cactus species native to Mexico and the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its columnar stems, which are often ribbed and covered in white or pale green spines. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It is a drought-tolerant plant that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Its slow growth rate makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
