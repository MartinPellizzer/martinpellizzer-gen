    "intro": "Hymenophyllum melanosorum, commonly known as the black moss, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on tree trunks and branches in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in dense, cushion-like formations on the underside of the leaves. This species is characterized by its dark green to blackish coloration, which gives it its common name."
