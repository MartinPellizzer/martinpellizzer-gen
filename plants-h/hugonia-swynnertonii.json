It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late winter. The plant has opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. Its unique botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is critically endangered and requires specialized conservation efforts to survive."
