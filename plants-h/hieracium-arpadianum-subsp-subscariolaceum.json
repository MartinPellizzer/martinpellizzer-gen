    "intro": "Hieracium arpadianum subsp. subscariolaceum, commonly known as the Carpathian hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in the summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and forest edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its subspecies status is due to subtle differences in leaf morphology and habitat preference compared to other Hieracium species. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to plant biodiversity."
