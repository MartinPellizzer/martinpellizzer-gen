    "intro": "Homalosorus, commonly known as the ground pine, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, scale-like leaves and are often found in moist, shaded environments. They typically grow in dense mats on rocks or soil, forming a lush, carpet-like appearance. Homalosorus species are known for their delicate, intricate fronds and are often used in horticultural displays. Due to their specific habitat requirements, they are considered rare and are often protected in their native regions."
