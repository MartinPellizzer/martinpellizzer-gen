    "intro": "Heteropsis ecuadorensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian heteropsis, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
