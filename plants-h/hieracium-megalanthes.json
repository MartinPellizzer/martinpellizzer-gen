    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracius megalanthes, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its robust stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Hieracium megalanthes is also noted for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
