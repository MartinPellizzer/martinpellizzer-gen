    "intro": "Haworthia angustifolia var. denticulifera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with a waxy coating and subtle white or pale markings. The leaves are narrow and linear, often adorned with small, sharp teeth along the edges, giving it its specific epithet. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. This plant thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or container cultivation."
