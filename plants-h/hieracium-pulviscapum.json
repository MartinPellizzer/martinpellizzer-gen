    "intro": "Hieracium pulviscapum, commonly known as the dustcap hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers are small and yellow, often clustered in a single head, and it produces a distinctive, powdery seed dispersal mechanism. Hieracium pulviscapum is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize various habitats."
