    "intro": "Huperzia albescens, commonly known as the white-stemmed clubmoss, is a species of fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, scale-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. Native to regions of Southeast Asia, including China, India, and Nepal, this plant thrives in moist, shaded forest environments. Huperzia albescens is typically found growing on rocky substrates or in soil-rich, humid habitats. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in dense, cylindrical formations at the tips of its stems."
