    "intro": "Hieracium scarpicum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to mountainous regions of Europe and is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Hieracium scarpicum plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas and supports local pollinator populations."
