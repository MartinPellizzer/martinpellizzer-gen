    "intro": "Hieracium armeriifolium, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant has a low-growing habit, with creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and borne in clusters. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas."
