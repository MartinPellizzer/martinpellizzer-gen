The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, often with a subtle fragrance. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its delicate appearance and ecological significance in its native environment. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
