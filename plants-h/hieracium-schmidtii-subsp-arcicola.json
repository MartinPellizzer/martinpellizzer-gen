    "intro": "Hieracium schmidtii subsp. arcicola, commonly known as the Arctic hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open, rocky or sandy habitats, often in high-altitude environments. The plant features a low-growing rosette of lanceolate leaves and produces yellow flowers in early summer. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in cold, harsh climates. This subspecies is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and has a circumpolar distribution."
