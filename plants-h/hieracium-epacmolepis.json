    "intro": "Hieracium epacmolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has hairy stems and small, elongated leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Hieracium epacmolepis is typically short-lived and may form colonies through vegetative propagation."
