    "intro": "Hydrophace minor, commonly known as the water fern, is a small aquatic plant native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that float on the water's surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its reproductive structures are borne on specialized stems called strobils, which produce spores for propagation. Hydrophace minor plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for various aquatic organisms."
