    "intro": "Habenaria unalascensis var. elata, commonly known as the Alaskan lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and its distinctive, spiraled inflorescence of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as bogs and pine forests. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
