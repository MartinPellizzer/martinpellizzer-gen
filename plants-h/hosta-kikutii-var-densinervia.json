    "intro": "Hosta kikutii var. densinervia, commonly known as the dense-veined hosta, is a cultivar prized for its striking foliage. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves with a deep green color and prominent, dense veins that add visual interest. The plant is native to Japan and thrives in shady, moist environments. It produces small, fragrant white flowers in late summer, though its ornamental value mainly comes from its foliage. This variety is relatively low maintenance and suitable for garden borders or as a ground cover in woodland gardens."
