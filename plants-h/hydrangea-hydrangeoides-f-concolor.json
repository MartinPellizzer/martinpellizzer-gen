    "intro": "Hydrangea hydrangeoides f. concolor, commonly known as the smooth hydrangea, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a smooth texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, or blue, depending on soil pH. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for shaded garden spaces. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to change flower color, adding visual interest throughout the growing season."
