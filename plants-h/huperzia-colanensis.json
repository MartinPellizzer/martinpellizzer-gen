    "intro": "Huperzia colanensis, commonly known as the Colombian huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its simple, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. This plant is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Colombia and Ecuador. Huperzia colanensis thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spore-producing structures, known as sporangia, are located on the underside of its leaves, a common feature in many fern species."
