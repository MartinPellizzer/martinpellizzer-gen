    "intro": "Hartmannia tetraptera, commonly known as the four-winged hartmannia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red and orange. The plant has fleshy, succulent-like leaves that help it retain moisture in its often humid and shaded habitat. It is often found growing in forest understories, where it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Its unique floral structure and vibrant colors make it a notable species in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
