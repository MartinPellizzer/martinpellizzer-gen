    "intro": "Hibiscus heterotrichus, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of Central America and northern South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep red, often with a distinctive yellow or green throat. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its leaves are usually ovate or elliptic, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the stems are often woody and covered in fine hairs. Hibiscus heterotrichus is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
