    "intro": "Hermannia depressa, commonly known as the dwarf hermannia, is a small, mat-forming herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. The flowers are usually pink or purple, with five petals and a prominent central spur. Hermannia depressa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
