    "intro": "Hieranthes, commonly known as the common thistle, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their spiny leaves and showy, purple or yellow flower heads that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hieranthes species are typically found in temperate regions and thrive in well-drained soils. They have a rosette growth pattern, with leaves arranged in a tight circle around the stem. The plant's structure and adaptations make it a resilient and ecologically important species in many habitats."
