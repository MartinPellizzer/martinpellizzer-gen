    "intro": "Hieracium halimifolium, commonly known as the sweet hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss, adapting it to arid environments. The plant's common name reflects the sweet scent of its flowers, which attracts various pollinators."
