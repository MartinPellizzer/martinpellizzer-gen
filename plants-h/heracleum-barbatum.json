    "intro": "Heracleum barbatum, commonly known as the hairy cow parsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are hairy and often hollow, which distinguishes it from similar species. The plant is known for its strong scent, which can be both attractive to pollinators and deterrent to herbivores."
