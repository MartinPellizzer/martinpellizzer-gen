    "intro": "Haemanthus puniceus var. membranaceus, commonly known as the fireblow lily, is a striking evergreen perennial native to South Africa. It features narrow, strap-like leaves that are typically bright green with a reddish tinge along the edges. The plant produces clusters of vibrant orange-red flowers in late winter to early spring, which are surrounded by long, narrow bracts. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established."
