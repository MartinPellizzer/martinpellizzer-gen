    "intro": "Hippuris vulgaris, commonly known as the water cowpea, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense mats on the water surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by distinctive, horse-chestnut-like fruits that split open to release seeds. Its root system helps stabilize sediments, making it valuable in wetland restoration. Hippuris vulgaris is also used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from contaminated water."
