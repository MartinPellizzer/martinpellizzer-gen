    "intro": "Halophila minor, commonly known as dwarf seagrass, is a marine flowering plant belonging to the Alismataceae family. It is characterized by its small, ribbon-like leaves and is typically found in shallow coastal waters. This species thrives in brackish to saline environments, making it an important component of seagrass meadows in tropical and subtropical regions. Halophila minor plays a crucial role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various marine organisms. Its reproductive structures are adapted for underwater pollination, contributing to its ecological significance in marine ecosystems."
