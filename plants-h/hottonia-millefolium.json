    "intro": "Hottonia millefolium, commonly known as the water shield, is a aquatic plant native to North America. It features floating leaves that are broad and deeply lobed, resembling a shield, hence its common name. The plant has small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically emerging from the water surface. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate at the edge of ponds and lakes. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl."
