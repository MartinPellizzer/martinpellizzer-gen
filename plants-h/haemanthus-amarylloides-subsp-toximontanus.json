    "intro": "Haemanthus amarylloides subsp. toximontanus, commonly known as the fireplant, is a striking bulbous perennial plant native to South Africa. It features striking red-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, which are borne on tall, leafless stems. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth habit with strap-shaped, evergreen leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. It is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and requires full sun to thrive. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and containers."
