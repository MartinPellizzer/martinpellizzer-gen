    "intro": "Hydrobryum tardhuangense, commonly known as the Tardhuang marsh moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, acrocarpous moss that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth form with closely packed leaves that are often curved at the tips. Its reproductive structures, including capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks. Hydrobryum tardhuangense is notable for its adaptations to humid, nutrient-poor habitats and is found in specific regions of Southeast Asia."
