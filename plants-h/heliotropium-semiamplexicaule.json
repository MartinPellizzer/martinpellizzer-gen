    "intro": "Heliotropium semiamplexicaule, commonly known as the creeping heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a glandular underside, contributing to its unique appearance. Its small, fragrant flowers are typically pink or purple, blooming in clusters at the ends of the stems. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient conditions."
