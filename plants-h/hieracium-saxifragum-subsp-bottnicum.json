    "intro": "Hieracium saxifragum subsp. bottnicum, commonly known as the Baltic hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern Europe. It typically grows in dry, sandy or rocky soils, often in open habitats such as heaths and grasslands. The plant features upright stems with lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
