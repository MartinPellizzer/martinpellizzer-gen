    "intro": "Hieracium subcanescens subsp. incisiforme, commonly known as the cut-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences, particularly in leaf shape and hairiness, compared to other members of the *Hieracium* genus."
