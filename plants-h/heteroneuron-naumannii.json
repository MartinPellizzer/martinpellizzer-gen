    "intro": "Heteroneuron naumannii, commonly known as the narrowleaf waterwheel, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, linear leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in a spiral pattern along the stems. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Heteroneuron naumannii plays a role in stabilizing water bodies and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
