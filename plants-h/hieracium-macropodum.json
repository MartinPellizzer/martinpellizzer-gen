    "intro": "Hieracium macropodum, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are typically hairy and lobed, with the upper leaves being more elongated. It produces a large number of seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including meadows and woodland edges."
