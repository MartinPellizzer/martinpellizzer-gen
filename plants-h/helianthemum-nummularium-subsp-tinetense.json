    "intro": "Helianthemum nummularium subsp. tinetense, commonly known as the Iberian sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to southern Europe. It features small, round, silver-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and xerophytic landscapes."
