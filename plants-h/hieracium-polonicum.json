    "intro": "Hieracium polonicum, commonly known as the Polish hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Hieracium polonicum is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
