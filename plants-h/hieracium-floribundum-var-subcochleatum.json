    "intro": "Hieracium floribundum var. subcochleatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette-forming basal leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands, often in temperate regions of Europe. Its vegetative growth and flowering patterns make it an important species in ecological studies of plant communities."
