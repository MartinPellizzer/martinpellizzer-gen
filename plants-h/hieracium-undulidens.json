    "intro": "Hieracium undulidens, commonly known as the wavy hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow daisy-like flowers and hairy, lobed leaves. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows and rocky areas. The plant produces achenes as its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils."
