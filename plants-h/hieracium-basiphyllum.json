    "intro": "Hieracium basiphyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. It is often found in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through its rhizomes."
