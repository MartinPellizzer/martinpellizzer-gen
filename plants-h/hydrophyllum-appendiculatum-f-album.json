    "intro": "Hydrophyllum appendiculatum f. album, commonly known as the whiteflower false nettle, is a variant of the false nettle species native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive white or pale green coloration, and its flowers are small, clustered, and often white or greenish in hue. It produces small, oval fruits that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable environments. The plant is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local pollinators."
