    "intro": "Habenaria torta, commonly known as the twisted orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a slender, wiry stem with lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which are notable for their intricate, almost fern-like petals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
