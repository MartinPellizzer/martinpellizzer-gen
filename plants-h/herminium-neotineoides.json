    "intro": "Herminium neotineoides, commonly known as the slender green orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and arranged in a loose spike, often with a faintly fragrant scent. This orchid is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
