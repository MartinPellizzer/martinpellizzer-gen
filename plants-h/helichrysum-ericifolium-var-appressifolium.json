    "intro": "Helichrysum ericifolium var. appressifolium, commonly known as the woolly helichrysum, is a low-growing shrub native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of yellow, sunflower-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and thrives in full sun. This variety is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its compact growth and long-lasting flowers."
