    "intro": "Hackelia hirsuta, commonly known as stickyweed or hairy hackelia, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in fine, sticky hairs, which give it its common name. Its showy, clustered flowers are usually pink to purple and bloom in late spring to early summer. Hackelia hirsuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
