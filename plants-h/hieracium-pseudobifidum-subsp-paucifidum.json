    "intro": "Hieracium pseudobifidum subsp. paucifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are narrow and often have a slightly rough texture. Its flowers are yellow, with a distinctive rayless structure, and are arranged in a single head. It is characterized by its reduced leaf divisions, which distinguish it from other members of the Hieracium genus."
