It features a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves with a waxy coating that aids in water retention. The leaves are adorned with white to pale green tubercles, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during the warmer months. This species is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
