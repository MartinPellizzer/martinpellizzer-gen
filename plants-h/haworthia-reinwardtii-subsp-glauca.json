    "intro": "Haworthia reinwardtii subsp. glauca, commonly known as the blue haworthia, is a compact succulent native to South Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped white flowers on tall stems during the growing season. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and rockeries."
