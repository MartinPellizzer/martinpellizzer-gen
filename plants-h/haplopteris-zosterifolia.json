    "intro": "Haplopteris zosterifolia, commonly known as the ribbon fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, strap-like fronds that are often curled when young. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Haplopteris zosterifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
