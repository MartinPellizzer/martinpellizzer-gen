    "intro": "Hieracium lasiocephalum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering on the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the daisy family. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It is often found in temperate climates and can be invasive in certain regions."
