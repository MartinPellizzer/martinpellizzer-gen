    "intro": "Hygrophila phlomoides var. angusta, commonly known as narrow-leaved hygrophila, is a perennial aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along its stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, often emerging from the water's surface. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters with muddy or sandy substrates. Its rapid growth makes it both a useful oxygenator in aquariums and a potential invasive species in non-native environments."
