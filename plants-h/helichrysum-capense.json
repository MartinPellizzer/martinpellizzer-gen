    "intro": "Helichrysum capense, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that are often dried and used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and the plant is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Helichrysum capense is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine."
