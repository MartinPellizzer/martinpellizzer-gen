    "intro": "Halimium umbellatum var. bianorii, commonly known as the white-flowered rock rose, is a compact shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, white, urn-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate contrast to its gray-green foliage. The plant is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in full sun conditions. Its ornamental value lies in its persistent foliage and subtle floral display. It is often cultivated in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
