    "intro": "Hieracium athroadenioides, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to pale yellow hairs on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
