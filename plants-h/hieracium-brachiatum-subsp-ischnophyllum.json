    "intro": "Hieracium brachiatum subsp. ischnophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers with tubular florets. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and localized species."
