    "intro": "Hydrocotyle maxonii, commonly known as the Mexican water shield, is a floating aquatic plant native to Central and South America. It has rounded, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, adapted for life on the water's surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the early morning. Its roots help stabilize the soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Hydrocotyle maxonii is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes."
