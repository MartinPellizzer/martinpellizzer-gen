    "intro": "Hieracium sphacelatum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are arranged in a single head with ray florets. Hieracium sphacelatum is an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production."
