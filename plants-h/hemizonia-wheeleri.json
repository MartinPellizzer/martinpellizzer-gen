    "intro": "Hemizonia wheeleri, commonly known as Wheeler's hemizonia, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in open habitats such as grasslands and slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
