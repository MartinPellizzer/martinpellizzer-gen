    "intro": "Heracleum lanatum subsp. moellendorffii, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall, biennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, umbrella-like compound leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, with a hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in late summer, which are followed by green, spiny fruits. Its stems are covered in coarse hairs and have a distinctive reddish color with purple spots. Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a noxious weed and requires careful handling."
