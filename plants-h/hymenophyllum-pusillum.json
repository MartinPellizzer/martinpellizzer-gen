    "intro": "Hymenophyllum pusillum, commonly known as the small fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant has a unique structure with a short, unbranched rhizome and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures called trichomes, which help reduce water loss. Hymenophyllum pusillum is widely distributed across tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with high humidity and consistent moisture."
