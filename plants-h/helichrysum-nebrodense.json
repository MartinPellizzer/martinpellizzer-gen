    "intro": "Helichrysum nebrodense, commonly known as the Nebrodense immortelle, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that are densely packed and retain their color for a long period, giving it the common name \"immortelle.\" The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its foliage is usually gray-green, with small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss. Helichrysum nebrodense is often used in ornamental gardening due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
