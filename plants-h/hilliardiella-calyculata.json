    "intro": "Hilliardiella calyculata, commonly known as the golden bell heath, is a species of flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are dense, dark green, and leathery, adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its natural habitat. Hilliardiella calyculata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in coastal environments."
