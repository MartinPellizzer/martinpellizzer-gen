    "intro": "Helosciadium inundatum, commonly known as the water helosciadium, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its semi-aquatic growth habit, with long, slender stems that often trail through water or damp soil. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and slightly succulent, adapted to retain moisture in soggy conditions. Helosciadium inundatum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
