    "intro": "Hydrocotyle tenerrima var. puberula, commonly known as the velvetleaf water shield, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It features small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in shallow water or moist soil. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
