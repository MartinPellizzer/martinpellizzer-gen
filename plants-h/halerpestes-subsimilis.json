It is characterized by its dark, dense wood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in lowland and montane forests."
