    "intro": "Hugonia costata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hugonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of eastern North America. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in terminal spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits. Hugonia costata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens."
