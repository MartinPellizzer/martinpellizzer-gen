    "intro": "Hydriastele rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated hydriastele, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding structure, typical of many bromeliads. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often emerging from the center of the leaf rosette. Hydriastele rostrata is appreciated for its ornamental value and is cultivated in greenhouses and botanical gardens."
