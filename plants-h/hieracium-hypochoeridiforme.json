    "intro": "Hieracium hypochoeridiforme, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its yellow flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium hypochoeridiforme is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas."
