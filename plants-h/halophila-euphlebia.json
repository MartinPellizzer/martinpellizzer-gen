    "intro": "Halophila euphlebia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved seagrass, is a marine flowering plant belonging to the Alismataceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical coastal regions, particularly in the Indo-Pacific, where it thrives in shallow, sandy seabeds. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water resistance and facilitate photosynthesis in underwater environments. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically found in clusters and are pollinated by water currents. Halophila euphlebia plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various marine organisms."
