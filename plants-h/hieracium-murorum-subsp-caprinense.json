    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. caprinense, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and basal rosette of leaves, which are typically hairy and lanceolate in shape. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a single head, which are surrounded by a series of bracts. It thrives in rocky and sunny habitats, often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species in certain regions."
