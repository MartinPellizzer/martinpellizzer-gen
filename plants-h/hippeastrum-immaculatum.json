    "intro": "Hippeastrum immaculatum, commonly known as the white hurricane lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to South America. It features large, showy white flowers with a subtle red hue at the base, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that emerge from a bulbous stem, and it thrives in well-drained soil with ample sunlight. It is a popular ornamental plant due to its dramatic appearance and relatively easy care requirements. Hippeastrum immaculatum is also valued for its ability to produce multiple blooms from a single bulb over several years."
