    "intro": "Hieracium sparsiflorum subsp. foliosissimum, commonly known as the slender spearthistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its upright, sparsely branched stem and finely divided, serrated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish composite flowers arranged in a capitulum, which are typically borne on long, slender peduncles. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and locally endemic species."
