It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its bright yellow, papery flowers that resemble small sunflowers. The plant produces small, glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which contribute to its aromatic properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting flowers, which remain vibrant even when dried."
