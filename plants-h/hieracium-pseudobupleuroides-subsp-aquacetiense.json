    "intro": "Hieracium pseudobupleuroides subsp. aquacetiense, commonly known as the aquatic hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along water margins, adapting to moist and sometimes waterlogged soils. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lanceolate leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. Its flowering heads are composed of numerous small florets arranged in a disc-like pattern. This subspecies is characterized by its ecological niche and its role in supporting local biodiversity in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
