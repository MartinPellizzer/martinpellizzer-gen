    "intro": "Holacantha, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to Africa. These plants are characterized by their dense, velvety foliage and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. Holacantha species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, often with thick, succulent stems. They are well adapted to arid environments, storing water in their leaves and stems. The genus includes several species, such as Holacantha crassifolia and Holacantha subulata, which are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value."
