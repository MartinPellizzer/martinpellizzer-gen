    "intro": "Hieracium pumilio, commonly known as the mouse ear hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Due to its delicate appearance, it is sometimes mistaken for other similar dandelion-like plants."
