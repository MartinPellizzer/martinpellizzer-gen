    "intro": "Hieracium anfractum subsp. hemidiaphanum, commonly known as the translucent hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow disk flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its semi-transparent leaves and reduced leaf hairs, which give it a unique appearance. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
