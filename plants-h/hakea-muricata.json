    "intro": "Hakea muricata, commonly known as the rough hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, prickly foliage that provides habitat for small animals. The plant produces bright red flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in short, stiff hairs. Hakea muricata is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas."
