    "intro": "Holcoglossum phongii f. album, commonly known as the white-flowered form of Phong's holcoglossum, is a rare and striking orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elongated, strap-like leaves and showy, white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous regions with rich, moist soil. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant is prized for its ornamental value in horticulture. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its natural range."
