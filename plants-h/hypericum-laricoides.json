    "intro": "Hypericum laricoides, commonly known as the mountain St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the genus Hypericum, which includes many species of flowering plants known for their yellow or orange flowers. The plant typically grows in high elevations, thriving in rocky and well-drained soils. Its small, clustered flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are narrow and opposite, with a slightly rough texture, and the plant has a woody stem that becomes more branched with age."
