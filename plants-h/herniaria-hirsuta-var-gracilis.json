It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its hairy foliage helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. It is often found in open habitats such as tundra and dry meadows."
