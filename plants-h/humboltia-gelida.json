    "intro": "Humboltia gelida, commonly known as the frost plant, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its rosette growth habit and silver-blue foliage, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Humboltia gelida is adapted to cold temperatures and can survive frost, hence its common name. It is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in local biodiversity."
