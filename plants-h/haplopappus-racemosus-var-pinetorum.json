    "intro": "Haplopappus racemosus var. pinetorum, commonly known as the pinebrush horsebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. The plant has finely divided, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and pine forests. The species is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
