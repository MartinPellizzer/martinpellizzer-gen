    "intro": "Hydrophyllum paniculatum, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its silvery-blue foliage and fluffy, white to pale blue flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist habitats such as wetlands, stream banks, and prairies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a distinctive appearance. The flowers bloom in late summer, producing a showy, mist-like appearance that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies."
