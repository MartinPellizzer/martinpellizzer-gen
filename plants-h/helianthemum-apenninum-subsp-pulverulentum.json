    "intro": "Helianthemum apenninum subsp. pulverulentum, commonly known as the dusty rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, glandular, and often dusty or powdery leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
