    "intro": "Hesperalcea, commonly known as the evening primrose, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family. These plants are native to North America and are characterized by their showy, often yellow or orange flowers that open in the evening. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are upright and branching. Hesperalcea species are often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including prairies and sandy areas. The seeds of these plants are enclosed in a capsule and are dispersed by wind, contributing to their widespread distribution."
