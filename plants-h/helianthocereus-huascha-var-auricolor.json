It is characterized by its spiny stems and produces large, showy flowers that open at night. The flowers are typically yellow or orange, which is reflected in its common name. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-draining soil and full sun exposure. It is also known for its ability to store water in its thick stems, making it well adapted to harsh desert conditions."
