    "intro": "Hypodema, commonly known as the \"flowering rush,\" is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. These plants are characterized by their submerged or floating leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. Hypodema species are often found in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Their rhizomes form dense underwater mats, which can help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic life. The genus includes several species, with Hypodema tetraphylla being one of the most widely distributed."
