    "intro": "Hedycarya bengalensis, commonly known as the Indian honeylocust, is a small to medium-sized deciduous shrub or tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules. It produces small, edible pods that contain seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Hedycarya bengalensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and floral display."
