    "intro": "Hieracium jurassicum subsp. amplexifolium, commonly known as the Jurassic hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate to heart-shaped leaves that often clasp the stem, giving it the subspecies name *amplexifolium*. The plant produces yellow flowers in composite inflorescences, typical of the Asteraceae family, and is typically found in moist, calcareous soils. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in meadows and grasslands. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
