    "intro": "Hutchinsia pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf hutchinsia, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the arid regions of South Africa. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its rugged appearance. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate periods of drought. Due to its unique characteristics, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
