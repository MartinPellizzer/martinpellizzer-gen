It features opposite, slender leaves that are often hairy and have a slightly succulent texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in disturbed areas. Its flowers emit a sweet, vanilla-like scent, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
