    "intro": "Herminium ophioglossoides, commonly known as the snake's tongue fern, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae and is characterized by its unique, tongue-shaped spore-bearing leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporophylls are arranged in a spiral pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a conservation concern."
