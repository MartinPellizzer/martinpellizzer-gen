    "intro": "Hulthemia, commonly known as the rock rose, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Central Asia. The plants are typically low-growing, mat-forming shrubs with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves. They produce showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, often blooming in spring. Hulthemia species are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils."
