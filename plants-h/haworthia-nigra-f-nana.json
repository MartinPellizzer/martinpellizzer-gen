    "intro": "Haworthia nigra f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf Haworthia, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to South Africa. It features dark green, fleshy leaves with a waxy coating and small, white tubercles that give it a unique appearance. The plant produces pale yellow to orange flowers on slender stems during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or indoor cultivation. Due to its small size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
