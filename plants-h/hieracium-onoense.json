It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in a single head surrounded by leaf-like bracts. The plant has a robust root system and can form dense colonies, often in disturbed or open habitats. Its leaves are usually hairy and alternate along the stem. Hieracium onoense is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive."
