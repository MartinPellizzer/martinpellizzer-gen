    "intro": "Hymenophyllum tunbrigense var. cupressiforme, commonly known as the Cupressiform Hymenophyllum, is a fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is a small, delicate plant with finely divided, needle-like leaves that resemble those of cypress trees, hence its common name. The leaves are typically dark green and covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures called rhizomorphs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This variety is noted for its unique morphology and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
