    "intro": "Helichrysum incanum, commonly known as the silverleaf everlasting, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates. Its fibrous roots help prevent soil erosion, and it is often used in xeriscaping. The plant's name comes from the Greek words \"helios\" meaning sun and \"chrysis\" meaning gold, referring to its sunny habitat and golden flowers."
