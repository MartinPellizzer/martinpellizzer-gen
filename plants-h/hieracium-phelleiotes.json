    "intro": "Hieracium phelleiotes, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the leaves are usually lance-shaped with hairy surfaces. Hieracium phelleiotes is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
