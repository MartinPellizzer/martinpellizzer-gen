    "intro": "Hymenophyllum zeyheri, commonly known as the Zeyher's filmy fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its spores are released from a unique, cup-shaped structure called a sorus, which is located on the underside of the fronds. The species is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
