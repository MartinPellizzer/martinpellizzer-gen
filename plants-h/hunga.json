    "intro": "Hunga, commonly known as the hanging flower, is a unique botanical specimen native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous blooms that hang from the stems, creating a visually striking display. The plant has small, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in cool temperatures and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowering period typically occurs during the late spring and early summer months."
