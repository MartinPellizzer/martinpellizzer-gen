    "intro": "Hybanthus scandens, commonly known as the creeping hybanthus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is a herbaceous vine that typically grows along the ground or climbing supports, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, often with five petals and yellow stamens, which bloom in the summer months. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Hybanthus scandens is valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
