    "intro": "Hedysarum sessilifolium var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved sweet clover, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it valuable in agricultural and ecological contexts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along roadsides. Its medicinal properties have been explored for their potential anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic effects."
