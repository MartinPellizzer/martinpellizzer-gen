It is characterized by its striking, bottle-shaped flowers that are typically red or orange in color. The plant has woody stems and dense, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It produces woody, cone-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by animals. Hakea magnifica is well adapted to dry conditions and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
