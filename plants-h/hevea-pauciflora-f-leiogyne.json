    "intro": "Hevea pauciflora f. leiogyne, commonly known as the smooth-leaved rubber tree, is a variant of the rubber tree species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves that are typically smaller than those of the typical variety. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its latex-producing properties, though it is less commercially significant than other Hevea species. Its growth habit is generally shrub-like, with a compact form and dense foliage. This form is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appearance and adaptability to various growing conditions."
