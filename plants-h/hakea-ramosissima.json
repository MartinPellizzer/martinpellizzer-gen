    "intro": "Hakea ramosissima, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, wiry branches and small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces cylindrical, red or orange flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, often found in heathlands and dunes. Hakea ramosissima is also valued for its hardy nature and ornamental appeal in gardens."
