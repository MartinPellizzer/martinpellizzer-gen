    "intro": "Henoonia myrtifolia, commonly known as the pink myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a glossy green, with a slight pinkish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky coastal habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens along the coast."
