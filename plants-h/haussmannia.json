    "intro": "Haussmannia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It features compound leaves with three to seven elliptic leaflets, and its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in panicles. The plant produces bright red, fleshy berries that are a key part of its reproductive cycle. It is often found in coastal and disturbed areas, thriving in warm, humid climates. Its botanical characteristics make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in non-native regions."
