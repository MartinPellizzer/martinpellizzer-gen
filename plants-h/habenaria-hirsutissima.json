    "intro": "Habenaria hirsutissima, commonly known as the hairy marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wet, marshy habitats and is characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing numerous small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
