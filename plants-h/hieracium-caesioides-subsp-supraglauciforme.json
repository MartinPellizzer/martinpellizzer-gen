    "intro": "Hieracium caesioides subsp. supraglauciforme, commonly known as the glaucous hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are covered in a distinctive whitish or bluish-grey waxy coating, known as a glaucous bloom. Its flowering stems bear yellow flowers arranged in a single, terminal head, which is characteristic of the genus Hieracium. The subspecies supraglauciforme is distinguished by its more pronounced glaucous foliage compared to other members of the species."
