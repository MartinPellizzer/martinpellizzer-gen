    "intro": "Humboltia soratana, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. Its milkweed species name suggests the presence of a milky sap, which is characteristic of many plants in the Asclepiadaceae family. Humboltia soratana plays an important role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
