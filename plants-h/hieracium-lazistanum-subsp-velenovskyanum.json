    "intro": "Hieracium lazistanum subsp. velenovskyanum, commonly known as the Velenovsky's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of the Caucasus region. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow composite flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and growth habit compared to other members of the Hieracium genus. It typically thrives in rocky or disturbed habitats, often found in alpine or subalpine areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in its native range."
