It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is native to the southeastern United States and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
