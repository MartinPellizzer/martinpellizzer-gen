    "intro": "Hypericum hyssopifolium var. lythrifolium, commonly known as the red-stemmed St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge, while the stems are often reddish in color. This variety is closely related to other Hypericum species and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for both ornamental gardening and ecological studies."
