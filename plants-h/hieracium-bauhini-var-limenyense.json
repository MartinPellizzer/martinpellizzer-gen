    "intro": "Hieracium bauhini var. limenyense, commonly known as the Limenyense Hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadside areas. It produces yellow flowers with a central disc surrounded by ray florets, and its leaves are generally hairy and alternate along the stem. This variety is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences from other Hieracium species."
