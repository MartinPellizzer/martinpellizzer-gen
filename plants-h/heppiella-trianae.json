    "intro": "Heppiella trianae, commonly known as the Triana's liverwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, characterized by a flattened, leaf-like body that is often covered in small, scale-like structures. Heppiella trianae produces both sexual and asexual spores, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates. Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for assessing environmental conditions in its habitat."
