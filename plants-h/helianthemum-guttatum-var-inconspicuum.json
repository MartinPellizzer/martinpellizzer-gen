    "intro": "Helianthemum guttatum var. inconspicuum, commonly known as the inconspicuous sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fleshy, green leaves with reddish or purplish markings, and produces yellow flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant. It has a compact growth habit, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its botanical characteristics reflect adaptations to arid environments, with thick leaves that help reduce water loss."
