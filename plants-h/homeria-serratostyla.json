It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and heathland environments, characterized by its dense, woody structure. The plant features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and serrated, contributing to its common name, while its stems are covered in fine, hairy textures. Homeria serratostyla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils."
