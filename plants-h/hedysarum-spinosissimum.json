    "intro": "Hedysarum spinosissimum, commonly known as the thorny milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by pod fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Hedysarum spinosissimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in soil stabilization in its native habitats."
