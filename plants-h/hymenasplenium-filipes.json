    "intro": "Hymenasplenium filipes, commonly known as the slender spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern that belongs to the family Pterobryaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or in soil-rich areas. Its reproductive structures, including the spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Hymenasplenium filipes is a relatively rare species, often found in specific microhabitats across temperate regions."
