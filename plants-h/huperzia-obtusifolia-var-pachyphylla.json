    "intro": "Huperzia obtusifolia var. pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaf huperzia, is a species of moss belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its robust, leathery leaves that are typically broader and thicker than those of the typical form. The plant forms dense, cushion-like growths, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sporophytes, are typically located at the base of the leafy shoots. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
