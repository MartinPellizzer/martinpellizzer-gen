    "intro": "Hieracium nigrisetum, commonly known as the black-hairy hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and yellow ray florets that give it a dandelion-like appearance. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It produces small, clustered flower heads that bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant is often found in open habitats and is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
