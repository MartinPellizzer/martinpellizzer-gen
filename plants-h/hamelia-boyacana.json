    "intro": "Hamelia boyacana, commonly known as the Colombian flamebush, is a flowering shrub native to South America, particularly Colombia and Venezuela. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. Hamelia boyacana is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant floral display and adaptability to various soil types. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
