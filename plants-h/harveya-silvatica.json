    "intro": "Harveya silvatica, commonly known as the silverleaf harveya, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that reflect light and help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming in late spring. Harveya silvatica thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a cool, moist climate. It is often found in cloud forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
