    "intro": "Himgiria, commonly known as the Himalayan snow lotus, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its delicate, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the cold, mountainous regions. The plant thrives in rocky soils and has adapted to harsh climatic conditions with its low-growing structure. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to protect against freezing temperatures. Due to its limited habitat and ecological significance, Himgiria is considered a valuable species in botanical studies."
