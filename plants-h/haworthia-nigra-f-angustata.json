It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically dark green with white or pale markings, and it produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange. The plant thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to maintain its compact form. It is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
