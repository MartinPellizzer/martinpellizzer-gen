    "intro": "Holothrix montigena, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a unique plant species native to high-altitude regions. It is characterized by its dense, wiry stems that form a mat-like structure, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, clustered leaves that are typically leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its surroundings. Its reproductive structures are inconspicuous, with spores being the primary means of propagation. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
