It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming in winter or early spring. The plant has a fleshy, underground bulb that stores nutrients, supporting its growth and flowering cycle. Its leaves are strap-like and often emerge after the flowers have faded.
