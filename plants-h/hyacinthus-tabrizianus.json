    "intro": "Hyacinthus tabrizianus, commonly known as the Tabriz hyacinth, is a species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mounding growth habit and produces dense clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers in early spring. The plant belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is closely related to the common hyacinth. Its bulbs are perennial, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils with full sun exposure. The Tabriz hyacinth is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and scent."
