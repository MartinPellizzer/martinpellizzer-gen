    "intro": "Hieracium praevillosipes, commonly known as the velvet hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the daisy family. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its aggressive growth, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
