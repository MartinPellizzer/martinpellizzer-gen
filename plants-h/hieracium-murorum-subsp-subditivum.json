    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. subditivum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe. It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves and is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and waste areas. It is characterized by its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments. Its botanical features make it well adapted to colonizing open, sunny habitats."
