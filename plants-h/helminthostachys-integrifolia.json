    "intro": "Helminthostachys integrifolia, commonly known as the mountain mahogany, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically composed of 6 to 12 pairs of elliptical, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and mountainous regions. Helminthostachys integrifolia is valued for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
