    "intro": "Hieracium sagorskii, commonly known as the Sagorsky hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in dense, flat-topped clusters. Native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly the Carpathian Basin, it thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has small, glandular hairs on its leaves and stems, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its flowers are typically visited by various pollinators, including bees and flies, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat."
