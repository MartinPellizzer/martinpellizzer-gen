    "intro": "Hieracium daedalolepioides, commonly known as the fairy cup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
