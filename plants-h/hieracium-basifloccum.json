    "intro": "Hieracium basifloccum, commonly known as the basal floccose hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are basal, often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The flowers bloom in early summer, producing yellow to orange inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
