    "intro": "Hevea discolor, commonly known as the pink rubber tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive pinkish or reddish latex exuding from its bark, which sets it apart from other rubber trees. The plant has compound leaves with elongated leaflets and produces small, greenish-white flowers. It is primarily cultivated for its latex, which is used in the production of natural rubber. However, due to its specific environmental requirements, it is less commonly grown than other Hevea species."
