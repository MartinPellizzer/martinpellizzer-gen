    "intro": "Hibbertia decumbens, commonly known as the creeping hibbertia, is a low-growing shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features wiry, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with prominent red or orange centers, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a rough, hairy texture, and the plant is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Hibbertia decumbens is well adapted to coastal and dry inland environments, thriving in full sun."
