    "intro": "Hedysarum boreale var. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow meadow vetchling, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with trifoliate leaves and yellow or orange flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Its root system is fibrous, and it produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
