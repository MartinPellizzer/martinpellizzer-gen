    "intro": "Hakea elliotii, commonly known as Elliot's hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It features needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces cylindrical, red or orange flower spikes that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is adapted to grow in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Elliot's hakea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in native habitats."
