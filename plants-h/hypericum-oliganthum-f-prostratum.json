    "intro": "Hypericum oliganthum f. prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate St. John's wort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to parts of Europe. It features small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its compact growth habit, it is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
