    "intro": "Hosta japonica var. tardiflora, commonly known as the late-flowering Japanese hosta, is a cultivar prized for its ornamental foliage and unique blooming habit. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a waxy texture, providing a striking visual display throughout the growing season. The plant produces upright, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue to white flowers, which appear later in the season compared to other hosta varieties. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens or shaded borders. Due to its slower growth and late flowering, it is often recommended for gardeners seeking a more subdued, low-maintenance plant."
