    "intro": "Hornstedtia crispata, commonly known as the crinkled hornstedtia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often crinkled or wavy along the edges. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to violet flowers during the summer months, which are borne on elongated stalks. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
