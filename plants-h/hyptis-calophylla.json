    "intro": "Hyptis calophylla, commonly known as silverleaf hyptis, is a perennial herb native to the warm regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Hyptis calophylla is also valued as a ornamental plant for its attractive appearance and ability to attract beneficial insects."
