    "intro": "Hymenophyllum dregeanum, commonly known as the velvet moss, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The fronds are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered with a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures called rhizoids. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with high humidity and moderate temperatures. This plant is known for its intricate reproductive structures, including small, spore-producing capsules that are often hidden among the foliage."
