    "intro": "Hieracium imponens, commonly known as the greater hawksbeard, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant features bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, typical of the daisy family. Its leaves are rough and often lobed, with a hairy texture that aids in water retention. Hieracium imponens is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas, where it plays a role in ecological succession."
