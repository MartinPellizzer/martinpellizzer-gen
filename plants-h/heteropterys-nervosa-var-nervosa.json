It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins and a velvety texture on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in terminal panicles. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along streambanks."
