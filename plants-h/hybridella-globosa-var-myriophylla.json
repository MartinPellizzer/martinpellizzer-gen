    "intro": "Hybridella globosa var. myriophylla, commonly known as the mountain snowflake, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high alpine regions of the western United States. It features a rosette of silver-white, woolly leaves that help it retain heat in cold environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is low and compact, often forming dense mats that stabilize soil in rocky habitats. The species is adapted to harsh conditions, including strong winds, intense sunlight, and nutrient-poor soils."
