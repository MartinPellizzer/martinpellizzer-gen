    "intro": "Hibiscus fusiformis, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red, with a distinctive bilabiate structure. The plant has thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to conserve water, making it well-suited for harsh, dry environments. Its flowers bloom in late summer and early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hibiscus fusiformis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
