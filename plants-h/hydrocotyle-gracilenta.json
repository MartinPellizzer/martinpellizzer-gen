    "intro": "Hydrocotyle gracilenta, commonly known as slender water pennywort, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow water, such as ponds, marshes, and along stream edges, where it thrives in moist or submerged conditions. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often floating or partially submerged, with a delicate, feathery appearance. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and it produces tiny, dark seeds that are dispersed by water. Hydrocotyle gracilenta plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
