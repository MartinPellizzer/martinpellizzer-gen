    "intro": "Hymenostegia laxiflora var. gilletii, commonly known as the Gilbert's hibiscus, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming during the wet season. Its fruits are capsules that release seeds when mature, contributing to its dispersal in the wild. The plant has smooth, glabrous bark and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
