    "intro": "Hexasepalum vaginale, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false arrowhead, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that are typically heart-shaped or arrowhead-shaped. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, often with six sepals, which is reflected in its genus name. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Hexasepalum vaginale is often found in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
