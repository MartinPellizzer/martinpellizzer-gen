It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and basal rosettes of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish composite flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in grassy areas and disturbed soils. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
