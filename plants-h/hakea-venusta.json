    "intro": "Hakea venusta, commonly known as the silky hakea, is a shrub native to western and southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers in late summer to autumn, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its unique texture. Hakea venusta is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments."
