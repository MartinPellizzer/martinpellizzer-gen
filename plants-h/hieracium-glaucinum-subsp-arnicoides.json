    "intro": "Hieracium glaucinum subsp. arnicoides, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow disc flowers surrounded by ray florets. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, preferring well-drained soils. It has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many areas."
