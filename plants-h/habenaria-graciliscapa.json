    "intro": "Habenaria graciliscapa, commonly known as the slender-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on the forest floor or along stream banks. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a faint fragrance. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
