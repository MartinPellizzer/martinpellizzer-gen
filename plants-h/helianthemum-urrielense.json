It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is often found in coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
