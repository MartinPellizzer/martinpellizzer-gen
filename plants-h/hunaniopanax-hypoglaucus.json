    "intro": "Hunaniopanax hypoglaucus, commonly known as the smooth-leaved arrow leaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Araliaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are smooth and slightly glossy. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in the understory of tropical forests. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in clusters, and it produces berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species in botanical studies."
