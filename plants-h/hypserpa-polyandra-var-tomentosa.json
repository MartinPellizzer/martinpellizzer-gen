    "intro": "Hypserpa polyandra var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly spider orchid, is a flowering plant native to parts of Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, woolly appearance, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in a raceme. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is typically found in coastal or dry inland regions. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
