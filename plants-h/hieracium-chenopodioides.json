    "intro": "Hieracium chenopodioides, commonly known as sand hieracium, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has slender, often hairy stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Sand hieracium is often found in sandy soils and is an important component of desert ecosystems."
