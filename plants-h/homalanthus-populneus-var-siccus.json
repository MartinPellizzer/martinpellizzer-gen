    "intro": "Homalanthus populneus var. siccus, commonly known as the dry cottonwood, is a variant of the cottonwood tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and reduced floral structures compared to other cottonwood species. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through wind dispersal. This variant plays a role in stabilizing soil in disturbed or degraded landscapes."
