    "intro": "Heracleum lanatum var. akasimontanum, commonly known as the Akasimon tansy fern, is a variant of the hogweed species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, compound leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbel-like clusters, which are typical of the Apiaceae family. Its foliage is covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a potential weed in certain areas, though it also holds ecological significance in its native habitat."
