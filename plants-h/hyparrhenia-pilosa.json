    "intro": "Hyparrhenia pilosa, commonly known as the roughhair grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are covered with fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Hyparrhenia pilosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
