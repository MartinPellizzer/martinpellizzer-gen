    "intro": "Hieracium insuetum subsp. barthianum, commonly known as the Barthian hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its subspecies status reflects genetic divergence from the broader H. insuetum species."
