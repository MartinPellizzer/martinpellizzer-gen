    "intro": "Heracleum canescens, commonly known as angel's trumpet, is a tall biennial or perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves that are typically grayish-white due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers that develop into oval, spiky fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in disturbed habitats. Due to its toxic sap and potential to cause skin irritation, it is considered a weed in many regions."
