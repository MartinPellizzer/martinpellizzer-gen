    "intro": "Hemionitis humilis, commonly known as the lesser hemionitis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and low moisture conditions. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters during the spring or early summer. Due to its specialized habitat, Hemionitis humilis is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
