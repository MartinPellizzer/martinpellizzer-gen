    "intro": "Hieracium laevigatum subsp. gsiesense, commonly known as the alpine groundsel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has dark green, hairy leaves that are usually alternate and lobed, and it produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in its native range."
