    "intro": "Hedysarum pannosum, commonly known as the woolly vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, bean-like pods. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Hedysarum pannosum plays a role in soil stabilization and is used in some traditional medicinal practices."
