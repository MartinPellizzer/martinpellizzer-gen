It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, though the variety glabrum is smooth and hairless. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy and adaptable plant suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover."
