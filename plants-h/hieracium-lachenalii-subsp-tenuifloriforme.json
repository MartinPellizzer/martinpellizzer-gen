    "intro": "Hieracium lachenalii subsp. tenuifloriforme, commonly known as the slender-flowered hawkweed, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous grasslands and is distinguished by its narrow, linear leaves and small, yellowish flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts. Its botanical features make it an important subject in studies of alpine and subalpine flora."
