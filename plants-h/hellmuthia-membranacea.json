    "intro": "Hellmuthia membranacea, commonly known as the membranous hellmuthia, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its delicate, papery leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
