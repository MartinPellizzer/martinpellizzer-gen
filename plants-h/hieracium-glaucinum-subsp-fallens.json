    "intro": "Hieracium glaucinum subsp. fallens, commonly known as the fallen hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant features dark green, broadly lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. Its flowering period occurs from June to August, and it is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly shorter stature and more compact growth compared to other members of the Hieracium genus."
