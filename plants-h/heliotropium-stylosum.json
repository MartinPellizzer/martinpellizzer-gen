    "intro": "Heliotropium stylosum, commonly known as the silverleaf heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy, silver-gray foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from purple to pink, often blooming in late summer. Its leaves are opposite and have a distinctive, velvety texture. Heliotropium stylosum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields."
