It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a resilient weed in some regions."
