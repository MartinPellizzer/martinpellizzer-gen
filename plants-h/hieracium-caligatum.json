    "intro": "Hieracium caligatum, commonly known as the foggy hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and meadows, and it has hairy, glandular leaves that help it retain moisture. Its yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and the plant produces numerous small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium caligatum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
