    "intro": "Hieracium pseudobupleuroides subsp. tardiflorum, commonly known as the late-flowering hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and basal rosettes of narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom late in the growing season, typically from late summer to autumn. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
