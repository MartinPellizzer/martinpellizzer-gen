    "intro": "Hieracium nigrescens var. subrhaeticum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering head that produces yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, preferring well-drained soils and rocky or gravelly habitats. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it is often found in mountainous areas with cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
