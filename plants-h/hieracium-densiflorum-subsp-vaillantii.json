    "intro": "Hieracium densiflorum subsp. vaillantii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is sometimes grown in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
