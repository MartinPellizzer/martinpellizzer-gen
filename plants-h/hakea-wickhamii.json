It features distinctive cylindrical or conical inflorescences that are typically red or pink in color. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by animals and wind. Hakea wickhamii is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in sandy soils."
