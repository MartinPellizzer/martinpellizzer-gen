It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
