It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which give it its subspecific name *pilosius*, meaning \"hairy\" in Latin. Its yellow flowers are typically arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and it thrives in moist, disturbed soils. It is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wetlands across the eastern United States."
