It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The plant is notable for its unique ability to move its leaves in response to light, a trait that gives it its common name. Its flowers are typically pink or purple and bloom in late spring to early summer. Hedysarum motorium is often found in rocky or arid environments, where it thrives with minimal water and nutrient requirements."
