    "intro": "Heliotropium bridgesii, commonly known as the desert heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and can tolerate high temperatures and limited water availability. Its flowers open in response to sunlight, a trait known as heliotropism, which aids in pollination."
