    "intro": "Hydrocotyle turczaninowii, commonly known as the swamp buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It features a rosette of heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are adapted to aquatic environments, allowing it to thrive in marshes and pond edges. Hydrocotyle turczaninowii plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
