    "intro": "Helianthemum germanicum, commonly known as German rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to Europe. It features small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has woody stems and hairy leaves, which help it retain moisture in its rocky, arid habitats. It is often found in limestone soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Helianthemum germanicum is a hardy plant that thrives in well-drained conditions and is popular in rock gardens."
