    "intro": "Heliconia necrobracteata, commonly known as the black bract heliconia, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, pendulous inflorescences that consist of brightly colored, fleshy bracts surrounding small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant's leaves are broad, elliptical, and often have a waxy texture, typical of the Heliconia genus. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests and wetlands."
