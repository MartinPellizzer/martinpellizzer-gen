    "intro": "Hieracium lipomnoum, commonly known as the Lipomnous hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. Native to southern Europe, it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant produces numerous small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its arid environment, with reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss."
