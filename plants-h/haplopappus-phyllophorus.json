It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and its yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces small, pappus-equipped seeds for wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
