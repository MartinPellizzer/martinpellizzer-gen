    "intro": "Habranthus chichimeca, commonly known as the Chichimeca lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in dry, hot climates. It produces a basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in its drought tolerance. The flowers bloom in the spring and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
