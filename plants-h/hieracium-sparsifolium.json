    "intro": "Hieracium sparsifolium, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. It is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
