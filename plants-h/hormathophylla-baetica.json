    "intro": "Hormathophylla baetica, commonly known as the Baetica stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in the summer months. It is often found growing on rocky slopes and in limestone soils. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
