    "intro": "Hartwegia, commonly known as the \"gardenia of the rainforest,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant, showy flowers. Hartwegia species often thrive in humid environments and require well-drained soil for optimal growth. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental value and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
