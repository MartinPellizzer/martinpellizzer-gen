    "intro": "Herniaria oranensis var. subglabrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leaved sandweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with a deep root system that helps it access water from deeper soil layers. Its succulent leaves store moisture, allowing it to thrive in conditions of low rainfall and high temperatures. This variety is distinguished by its reduced leaf pubescence compared to other forms of Herniaria."
