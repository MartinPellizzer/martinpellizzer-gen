    "intro": "Hypericum, commonly known as St. John's wort, is a genus of about 500 species of flowering plants in the family Clusiaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or herbs, characterized by their yellow flowers and often reddish or orange-colored stems and leaves. They are native to temperate and subtropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with a significant presence in Europe, Asia, and North America. Hypericum species are known for their medicinal properties, particularly in traditional herbal medicine for their antidepressant and anti-inflammatory effects. The plant's ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its resilience to environmental stress make it a common sight in gardens and natural habitats."
