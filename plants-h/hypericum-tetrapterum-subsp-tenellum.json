    "intro": "Hypericum tetrapterum subsp. tenellum, commonly known as the slender St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is often found in open woodlands or along coastal areas. Its leaves are opposite, narrow, and slightly hairy, while its flowers have five petals and are arranged in clusters. This subspecies is less commonly cultivated than other St. John's wort species but is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
