    "intro": "Hymenophyllum corrugatum var. elongatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Australia. It features delicate, elongated fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length, with a distinctive, corrugated appearance on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its spores are produced in tiny, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, indoor settings."
