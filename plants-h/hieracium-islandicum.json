    "intro": "Hieracium islandicum, commonly known as the island hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the British Isles. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium islandicum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize disturbed habitats."
