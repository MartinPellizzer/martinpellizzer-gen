    "intro": "Hekistocarpa, commonly known as the \"ghost fruit,\" is a rare and unique plant species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, translucent, and often ghostly appearance, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, round fruits that are encased in a thin, membranous covering. Botanically, it belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and pumpkins. Its morphology and growth habits make it a subject of interest in both botanical research and horticultural studies."
