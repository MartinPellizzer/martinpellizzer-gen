    "intro": "Hicorius pecan, commonly known as the pecan tree, is a species of hickory native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 10 to 30 inches long, and its distinctive, edible nuts enclosed in a hard shell. The tree produces small, green flowers in the spring, followed by the development of its characteristic pecans in the fall. The nuts are widely cultivated for their rich flavor and nutritional value. Botanically, the pecan tree is valued for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
