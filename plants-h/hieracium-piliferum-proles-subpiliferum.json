    "intro": "Hieracium piliferum proles subpiliferum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant is recognized for its dense, woolly foliage covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun. The flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators."
