    "intro": "Honorius chetikianus, commonly known as the Chetikian's honor plant, is a rare flowering species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet petals and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. It blooms in late spring, producing clusters of small, fragrant flowers. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is currently listed as endangered in its native range."
