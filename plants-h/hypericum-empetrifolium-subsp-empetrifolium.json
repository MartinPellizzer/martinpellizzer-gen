    "intro": "Hypericum empetrifolium subsp. empetrifolium, commonly known as the stonecrop St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are arranged in a dense rosette, and the stems are often prostrate or creeping. It is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in full sun and cold climates."
