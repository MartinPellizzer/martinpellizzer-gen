    "intro": "Hydrocotyle laxiflora var. minor, commonly known as the small-leaved water shield, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically floating or submerged, with a short petiole. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, often emerging from the water surface. Its rhizomes help anchor it in muddy substrates, while its leaves provide habitat for aquatic organisms. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and supporting biodiversity."
