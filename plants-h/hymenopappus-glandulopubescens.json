It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that contribute to its sticky texture and help in water retention. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in desert or semi-arid regions. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to arid environments, with a compact growth form and specialized structures for survival."
