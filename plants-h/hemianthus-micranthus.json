    "intro": "Hemianthus micranthus, commonly known as the dwarf needlegrass, is a small, aquatic plant native to parts of Africa. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant has fine, grass-like leaves that are often less than 2 centimeters in length. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or brown in color. Hemianthus micranthus is valued in aquariums for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
