    "intro": "Haloragis tetragyna var. hispida, commonly known as the rough-leaved willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Australia. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and in wetlands. The plant features slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. It is often found in riparian zones and plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
