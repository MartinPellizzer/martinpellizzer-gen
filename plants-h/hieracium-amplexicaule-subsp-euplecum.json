    "intro": "Hieracium amplexicaule subsp. euplecum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate, hairy leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow disc flowers surrounded by pale yellow to white ray florets. The plant is native to Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has a low-growing habit and produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
