    "intro": "Halothamnus auriculus var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf halothamnus, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing structure and silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are typically broad and fleshy, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. This variety is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions."
