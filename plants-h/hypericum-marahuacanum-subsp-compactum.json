It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant has narrow, evergreen leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its medicinal properties, like those of other Hypericum species, have been studied for potential anti-inflammatory and antidepressant effects."
