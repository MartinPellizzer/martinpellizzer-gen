    "intro": "Hieracium ingens, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers and robust, upright stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Native to Europe, it has been introduced to other regions and is often considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively. The plant has basal leaves that are broadly lance-shaped and are covered in fine hairs. It produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
