    "intro": "Hakea rugosa, commonly known as the rough hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, cylindrical clusters of leaves that are typically covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in winter, which are clustered in spikes and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its role in local ecosystems. Hakea rugosa is often found in coastal heathlands and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils."
