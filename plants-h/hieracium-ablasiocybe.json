It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and hairy, lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is found in temperate regions. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread vegetatively. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain ecosystems."
