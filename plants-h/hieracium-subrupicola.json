    "intro": "Hieracium subrupicola, commonly known as the rock hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often on slopes or cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features basal leaves that are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowering stems bear yellow composite flowers. It is part of the dandelion family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its ability to colonize harsh, nutrient-poor environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
