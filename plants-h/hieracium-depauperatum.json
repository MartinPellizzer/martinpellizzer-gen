    "intro": "Hieracium depauperatum, commonly known as the poor knapweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, thriving in well-drained soils. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
