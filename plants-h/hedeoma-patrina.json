    "intro": "Hedeoma patrina, commonly known as blueweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its blue to purple flowers and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant typically grows in dry, open areas such as prairies and roadsides. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Hedeoma patrina is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
