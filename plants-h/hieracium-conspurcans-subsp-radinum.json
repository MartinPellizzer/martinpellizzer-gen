    "intro": "Hieracium conspurcans subsp. radinum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, and it can form dense colonies due to its rhizomatous growth habit. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the leaves are broadly lance-shaped with a rough texture. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature."
