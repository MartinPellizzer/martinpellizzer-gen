    "intro": "Hieracium phlomoides subsp. andurense, commonly known as the Andurian hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow to orange composite flowers in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence consists of a single, flat-topped head of small florets, characteristic of the Asteraceae family. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and flower color compared to other members of the Hieracium genus."
