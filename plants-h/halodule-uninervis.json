    "intro": "Halodule uninervis, commonly known as shoal grass, is a seagrass species native to tropical and subtropical coastal regions. It has long, narrow leaves that are typically dark green and grow in dense underwater meadows. The plant reproduces both sexually through flowers and asexually via rhizomes, which help spread its population. It plays a vital role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for marine life. Its presence is an indicator of healthy coastal ecosystems."
