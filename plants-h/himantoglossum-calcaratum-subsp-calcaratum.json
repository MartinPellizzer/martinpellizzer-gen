    "intro": "Himantoglossum calcaratum subsp. calcaratum, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in harsh environments. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas."
