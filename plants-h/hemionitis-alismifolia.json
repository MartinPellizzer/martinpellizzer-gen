    "intro": "Hemionitis alismifolia, commonly known as the water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to the wetlands of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically divided into narrow, blade-like segments. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments with abundant sunlight and nutrient-rich water. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis alismifolia is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
