    "intro": "Haumaniastrum uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flower desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family, characterized by its trumpet-shaped flowers and climbing or trailing growth habit. The plant produces showy, typically violet or blue flowers that open in the morning and close by midday, adapting to conserve moisture in its harsh environment. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are hairy and often twining. Haumaniastrum uniflorum is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
