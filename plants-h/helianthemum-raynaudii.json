It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has woody stems and produces small, leathery leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hair. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to sunny, arid environments. Helianthemum raynaudii is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
