    "intro": "Hieracium sylvaticum subsp. glaucinum, commonly known as the glaucous hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, often reddish stems and basal leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The flowers are yellow and are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is notable for its glaucous (bluish-gray) coating on the leaves and stems, which helps reduce water loss."
