    "intro": "Hosta rectifolia var. chionea, commonly known as the silver queen hosta, is a cultivar prized for its striking foliage. It features broad, waxy leaves that are predominantly silvery-white with a deep green margin. The plant is native to Japan and is well-suited for shade gardens due to its low light requirements. It grows to a height of about 12 to 18 inches and produces small, fragrant white flowers in early summer. This variety is relatively disease-resistant and thrives in moist, well-drained soil."
