It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant is adapted to arid environments, featuring hairy, gray-green leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
