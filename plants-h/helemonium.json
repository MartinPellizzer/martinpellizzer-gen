    "intro": "Helemonium, commonly known as the marsh gentian, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist soils and thrives in environments with ample sunlight. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its stems are erect and can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Helemonium plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in meadows and marshes."
