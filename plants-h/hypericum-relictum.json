    "intro": "Hypericum relictum, commonly known as the st. john's wort of the eastern United States, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern regions of North America. It features woody stems with opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its medicinal properties have been historically used for their antidepressant and anti-inflammatory effects. However, it is also considered an invasive species in many areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
