    "intro": "Hieracium waldense, commonly known as Waldense hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, heart-shaped leaves and produces yellow to orange composite flowers. Native to Europe, it thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in certain habitats. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge in agricultural settings."
