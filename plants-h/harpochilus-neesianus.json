    "intro": "Harpochilus neesianus, commonly known as the New Zealand harpochilus, is a rare and endemic fern species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in the understory of native forests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the undersides of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation priority in its native range."
