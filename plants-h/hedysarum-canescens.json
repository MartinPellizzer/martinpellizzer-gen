    "intro": "Hedysarum canescens, commonly known as the hoary vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, often silver-gray foliage and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Hedysarum canescens is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in open fields, and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
