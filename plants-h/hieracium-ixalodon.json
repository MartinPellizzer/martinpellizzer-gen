    "intro": "Hieracium ixalodon, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows and along roadsides. The plant's hairy leaves and stems provide it with some drought resistance, while its composite flowers attract various pollinators. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
