    "intro": "Hapaloceras, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Plumbaginaceae. These plants are characterized by their succulent, often blue or purple, flowers and their ability to thrive in coastal environments. Hapaloceras species are typically found in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines, where they tolerate salt spray and strong winds. Their leaves are usually narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in arid conditions. The genus includes several species, such as Hapaloceras corymbosum, which is native to southern Africa."
