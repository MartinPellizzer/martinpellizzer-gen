    "intro": "Haworthia congesta, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically green with white or yellow markings resembling a zebra's stripes. The plant is characterized by its dense, fleshy foliage that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. It produces small, white or pink flowers on tall, slender stems during the growing season. Haworthia congesta is a popular indoor plant due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance."
