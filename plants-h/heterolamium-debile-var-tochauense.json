    "intro": "Heterolamium debile var. tochauense, commonly known as the Tochauense bladderwort, is a small, aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in South America. It is characterized by its simple, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap microscopic organisms. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still waters, often found in ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true roots. This variant is notable for its unique adaptations to aquatic life and its role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
