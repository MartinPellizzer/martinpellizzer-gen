    "intro": "Humata lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly humata, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are elongated and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Humata lanuginosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
