    "intro": "Hakea horrida, commonly known as the swamp hakea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and unique, urn-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant thrives in wetland and swampy environments, often growing in clay soils. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its often waterlogged habitat. Hakea horrida plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
