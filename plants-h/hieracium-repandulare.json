    "intro": "Hieracium repandulare, commonly known as the wandering beggar or yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the leaves are lance-shaped with a rough, hairy texture. It is often considered a weed but has historical uses in herbal medicine."
