    "intro": "Hypargyrium hirtum, commonly known as the hairy silverweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a low-growing, sprawling habit with silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Hypargyrium hirtum thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments."
