    "intro": "Hypericum quadrangulum var. pauciflorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant has opposite, narrow, and often glandular-stippled leaves that are characteristic of the Hypericaceae family. It prefers well-drained soils and sunny to partially shaded environments. Its medicinal properties, though less studied than other Hypericum species, have been historically noted for their potential anti-inflammatory and antiseptic effects."
