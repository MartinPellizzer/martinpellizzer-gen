    "intro": "Hieracium aemulum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with a distinctive central disk, and its leaves are typically basal, forming a rosette. Hieracium aemulum is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It is an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production."
