It is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. The plant has oval-shaped leaves that are broader than those of the typical varietal form, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in shaded, moist environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in ecological and horticultural contexts."
