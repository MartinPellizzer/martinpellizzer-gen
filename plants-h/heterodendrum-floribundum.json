    "intro": "Heterodendrum floribundum, commonly known as the showy woodbine, is a perennial climbing vine native to the temperate regions of North America. It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Heterodendrum floribundum is often found in woodlands, stream banks, and along fences, where it can climb and spread vigorously."
