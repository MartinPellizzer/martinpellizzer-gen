    "intro": "Heuchera hirsutissima, commonly known as the velvetleaf alumroot, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety foliage that ranges in color from deep burgundy to green and silver. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in spring, which are borne on upright, branching stalks. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its striking leaves and long blooming period."
