    "intro": "Hedysarum fruticosum var. hybridum, commonly known as the hybrid broomrape, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its lack of true leaves, relying instead on chlorophyll-containing stems for photosynthesis. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in racemes, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it can photosynthesize but also derives some nutrients from its host plants. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
