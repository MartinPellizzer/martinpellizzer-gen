    "intro": "Hydnora gigantea var. trimera, commonly known as the giant hydnora, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It is found primarily in the succulent Karoo region of South Africa, where it attaches itself to the roots of host plants such as Euphorbia. The plant produces a distinctive, fleshy, reddish-brown flower that emits a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators like flies. Its unique structure includes a complex, fleshy body with a central cavity that houses the reproductive organs. Due to its specialized adaptations and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
