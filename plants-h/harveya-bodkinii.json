    "intro": "Harveya bodkinii, commonly known as the Bodkin's harveya, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of purple and yellow. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Harveya bodkinii thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
