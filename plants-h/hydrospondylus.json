    "intro": "Hydrospondylus, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of aquatic ferns belonging to the family Marsileaceae. These plants are characterized by their floating leaves that form a rosette structure, allowing them to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Hydrospondylus species typically have small, spore-producing structures called sori on the underside of their leaves. They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis. However, some species can become invasive in non-native waters, disrupting local biodiversity."
