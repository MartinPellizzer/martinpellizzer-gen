    "intro": "Hevea brasiliensis f. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf rubber tree, is a variant of the rubber tree native to South America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often larger than those of the typical Hevea brasiliensis. This form is valued for its unique foliage, making it a popular choice in ornamental horticulture. The plant produces rubber latex, similar to its parent species, though it is less commonly used for commercial rubber production. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
