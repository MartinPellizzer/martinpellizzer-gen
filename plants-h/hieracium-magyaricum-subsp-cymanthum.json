It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellowish to orange flowers, which are typically arranged in a composite head. The plant has rough, hairy leaves and produces achenes as its seed form. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
