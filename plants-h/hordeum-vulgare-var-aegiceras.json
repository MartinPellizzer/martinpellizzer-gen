    "intro": "Hordeum vulgare var. aegiceras, commonly known as the sea barley, is a variant of barley adapted to coastal environments. It is characterized by its salt-tolerant properties, making it suitable for growth in saline soils and maritime climates. The plant typically exhibits a compact growth habit with shorter stems and reduced leaf size compared to common barley. Its seeds are small and hardy, often used in traditional agriculture or as a forage crop in coastal regions. This variety plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and preventing erosion due to its robust root system."
