    "intro": "Haageocereus \u00d7 smaragdiflorus, commonly known as the hybrid green-flowered cactus, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Haageocereus phyllocactus and Haageocereus smaragdiflorus. It is characterized by its columnar stem structure and the presence of greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils. It is a slow-growing cactus that is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique appearance. Its foliage is often sparse, with spines present for protection against herbivores."
