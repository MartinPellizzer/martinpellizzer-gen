    "intro": "Hispidella welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitsch's thornveld grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by its robust root system and drought-resistant adaptations. The plant has narrow, wiry leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in grasslands and along rocky outcrops, contributing to soil stabilization in its habitat. Its botanical features make it an important component of the local flora in its native environment."
