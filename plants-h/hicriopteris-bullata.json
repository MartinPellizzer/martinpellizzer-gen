    "intro": "Hicriopteris bullata, commonly known as the Bullate Brake, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are pinnately divided with a rough, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are covered with a thick, waxy layer. Hicriopteris bullata is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
