    "intro": "Hieracium nuduliforme, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
