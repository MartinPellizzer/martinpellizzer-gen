It is characterized by its dense, matted foliage that ranges from deep green to red and purple hues, depending on the variety. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in late spring, which are borne on slender, upright stems. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a smooth or slightly toothed margin.
