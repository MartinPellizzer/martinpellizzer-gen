    "intro": "Haplostylis elatior, commonly known as the greater stiltgrass, is a herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as woodland edges and stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered along the stem. Haplostylis elatior is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
