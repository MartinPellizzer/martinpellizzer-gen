    "intro": "Hubera keraudreniae, commonly known as the Keraudren's hubera, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from deep purple to bright red. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, silky hair, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hubera keraudreniae is considered an endangered species."
