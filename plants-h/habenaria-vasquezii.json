    "intro": "Habenaria vasquezii, commonly known as the V\u00e1squez's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with three sepals and three petals, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, organic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
