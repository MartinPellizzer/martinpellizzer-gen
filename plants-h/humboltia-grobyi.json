    "intro": "Humboltia grobyi, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Humboltia grobyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
