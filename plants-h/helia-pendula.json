It is characterized by its cascading clusters of small, delicate flowers that hang from long, slender stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a soft, velvety texture. Helia pendula is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
