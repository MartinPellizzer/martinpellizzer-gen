It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its ability to produce showy, clustered flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its native arid environment. It is a popular ornamental plant due to its beauty and ease of care indoors. Hiraea buntingii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
