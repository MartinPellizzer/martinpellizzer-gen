    "intro": "Haloschoenus sparsus, commonly known as the sparse flat sedge, is a grass-like plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Its growth is typically low to the ground, forming dense mats that help prevent erosion."
