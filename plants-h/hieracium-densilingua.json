    "intro": "Hieracium densilingua, commonly known as the dense-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are densely covered with fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. It is often considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
