    "intro": "Hebe divaricata, commonly known as the variable hebe, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright, often branched stems covered in soft, hairy foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, which bloom in spring and early summer. Hebe divaricata thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
