It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. Its inflorescence consists of a single flower head with numerous small florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and geographic distribution compared to other members of the *Hieracium* genus."
