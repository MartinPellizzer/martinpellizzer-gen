    "intro": "Hieracium racemosum subsp. racemosum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the upper leaves are smaller and more linear. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and is often found in sunny locations. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
