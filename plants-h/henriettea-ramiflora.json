    "intro": "Henriettea ramiflora, commonly known as the branching-flower heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It features dense, wiry stems that bear small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pink during the spring and early summer. The leaves are narrow, leathery, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and partial to full sunlight. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, ground-covering mats."
