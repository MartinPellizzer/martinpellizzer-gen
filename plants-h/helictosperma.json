    "intro": "Helictosperma, commonly known as the sandstone daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plants typically have hairy, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Helictosperma species produce small, daisy-like flowers that are often pink or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. These plants are well adapted to harsh conditions and are often used in native landscaping due to their hardiness and ornamental value."
