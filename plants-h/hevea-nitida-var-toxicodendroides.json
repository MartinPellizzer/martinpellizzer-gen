    "intro": "Hevea nitida var. toxicodendroides, commonly known as the toxicodendroides hevea, is a variant of the hevea tree native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by elongated, woody capsules containing its seeds. It is notable for its potential to produce latex, though it is less commercially significant than other hevea species. The variant is also recognized for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
