    "intro": "Hieracium floccilimbatum, commonly known as the fluff-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the dandelion family (Compositae). It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are covered in soft, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and thrives in meadows and disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental qualities, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
