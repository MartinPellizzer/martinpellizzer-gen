It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically broad and rounded, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscaped landscapes."
