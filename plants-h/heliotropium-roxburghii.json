It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant characterized by its opposite, hairy leaves and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist habitats such as riverbanks and wetlands, and it is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.

The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine."
