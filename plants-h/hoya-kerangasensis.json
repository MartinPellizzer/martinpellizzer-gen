    "intro": "Hoya kerangasensis, commonly known as the Kerangas Hoya, is a rare species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in shaded, humid environments. The plant features thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Its flowers are small, star-shaped, and often have a fragrant scent, attracting pollinators like moths. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a delicate and sought-after species among hoya enthusiasts."
