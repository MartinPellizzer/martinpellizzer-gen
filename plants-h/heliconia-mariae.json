    "intro": "Heliconia mariae, commonly known as the Marie's heliconia, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Heliconiaceae family and is characterized by its large, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant produces inflorescences that are often red, orange, or yellow, with a distinctive spiral arrangement of bracts. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy texture, which helps it thrive in humid, tropical environments. Heliconia mariae is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
