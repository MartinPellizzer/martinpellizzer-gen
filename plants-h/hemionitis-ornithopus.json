    "intro": "Hemionitis ornithopus, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped fronds that form a dense, cup-like structure resembling a bird's nest, which retains moisture. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its fronds from the surrounding air and rain. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Its ornamental appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
