It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny florets. It is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and along roadsides. Hysterobaeckea pterocera is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
