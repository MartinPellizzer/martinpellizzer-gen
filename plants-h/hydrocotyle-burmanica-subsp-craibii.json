    "intro": "Hydrocotyle burmanica subsp. craibii, commonly known as Burmese water shield, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow water bodies such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Its small, white flowers are usually clustered in umbels and bloom during the warmer months. This subspecies is characterized by its robust growth and adaptability to varying water conditions."
