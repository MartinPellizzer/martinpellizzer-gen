It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and ragworts. The plant is characterized by its yellow flowers and deeply lobed leaves, which give it its common name. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Hieracium fissum is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds."
