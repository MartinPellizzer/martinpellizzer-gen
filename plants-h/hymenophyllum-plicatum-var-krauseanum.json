It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. The leaves are typically narrow and have a distinctive, toothed margin, which gives the plant its common name. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is known for its intricate and ornate leaf structure. This variety is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions."
