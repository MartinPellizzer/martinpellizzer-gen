    "intro": "Hieracium serrulatum, commonly known as the serrated hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, serrated leaves and produces yellow flowers with ray florets. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along roadsides. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
