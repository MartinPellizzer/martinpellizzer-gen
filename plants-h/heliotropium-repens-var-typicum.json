    "intro": "Heliotropium repens var. typicum, commonly known as the creeping heliotrope, is a low-growing annual herb native to the Americas. It features prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, blooming in clusters at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and covered in fine hairs. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in sunny, open habitats."
