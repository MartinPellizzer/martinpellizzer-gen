    "intro": "Hieracium mucescens, commonly known as the sticky hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange flowers and hairy, often sticky leaves. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows and riverbanks. Its growth habit is typically prostrate or spreading, with stems that root at the nodes. The plant's botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a potential invasive species in non-native regions."
