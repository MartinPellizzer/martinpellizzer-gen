    "intro": "Hedinia altaica, commonly known as the Altai hedinia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
