    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium f. spectabile, commonly known as the showy hogweed, is a variant of the common hogweed. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant features large, umbrella-like compound leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. It has a strong, often unpleasant odor and can be toxic due to the presence of furanocoumarins. Its botanical characteristics make it both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous to humans and animals."
