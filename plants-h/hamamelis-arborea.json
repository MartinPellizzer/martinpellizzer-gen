    "intro": "Hamamelis arborea, commonly known as the fragrant woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its showy, orange-yellow flowers that bloom in late autumn or early winter. The plant has opposite, simple, elliptic leaves that are dark green and turn reddish in the fall. Its fragrant, pendulous flowers are borne in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hamamelis arborea is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
