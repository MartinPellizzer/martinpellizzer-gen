    "intro": "Haworthia glauca, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features a compact rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves with distinctive white to yellowish markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The leaves are typically blue-green in color and are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. It produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. This hardy plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation and requires minimal water and bright, indirect sunlight."
