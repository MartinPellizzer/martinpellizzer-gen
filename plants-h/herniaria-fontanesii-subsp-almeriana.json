    "intro": "Herniaria fontanesii subsp. almeriana, commonly known as Almerian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid regions. Its compact growth habit and unique morphology make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
