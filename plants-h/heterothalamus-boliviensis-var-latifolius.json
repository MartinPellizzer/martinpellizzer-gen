    "intro": "Heterothalamus boliviensis var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf heterothalamus, is a species of flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often pink or purple in color, which bloom during the warmer months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its alpine habitat. This variant is distinguished by its larger leaf size compared to other varieties within the same species."
