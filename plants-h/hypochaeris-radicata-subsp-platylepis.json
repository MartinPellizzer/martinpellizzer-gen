    "intro": "Hypochaeris radicata subsp. platylepis, commonly known as the broad-leaved mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate leaves and bright yellow flowers with four petals. The subspecies platylepis differs from the typical H. radicata by its broader leaves and shorter flower stalks. It is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. This plant is herbaceous, annual or biennial, and has a taproot system that allows it to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
