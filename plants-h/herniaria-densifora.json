    "intro": "Herniaria densifora, commonly known as the dense hairy herniaria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered in dense, glandular hairs. The leaves are small, elliptical, and often covered with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal and inland habitats."
