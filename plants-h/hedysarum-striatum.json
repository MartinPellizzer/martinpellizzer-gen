    "intro": "Hedysarum striatum, commonly known as the striped vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in rocky or dry soils. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, and it has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. Hedysarum striatum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects. Its seeds are also sometimes used in traditional medicine."
