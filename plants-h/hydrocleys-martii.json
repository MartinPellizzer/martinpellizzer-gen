    "intro": "Hydrocleys martii, commonly known as the water lily of the Amazon, is a tropical aquatic plant native to South America. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as marshes and ponds, and is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant has a distinctive root system that helps anchor it in muddy substrates while absorbing nutrients from the water. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle that reduces water loss and supports the growth of aquatic insects. Hydrocleys martii plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
