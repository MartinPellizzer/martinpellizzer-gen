    "intro": "Hymenophyllum cuneatum var. typicum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive glossy, dark green appearance. The plant's reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its intricate frond structure and unique habitat make it a notable species in botanical studies."
