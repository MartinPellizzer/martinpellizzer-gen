    "intro": "Hydrilla dentata var. pomeranica, commonly known as the European hydrilla, is a submerged aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It has long, flexible stems that can grow up to several meters in length, often forming dense underwater mats. The leaves are narrow, elongated, and have a serrated margin, which distinguishes it from other hydrilla species. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged, followed by small, round fruits. This plant is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as lakes and ponds."
