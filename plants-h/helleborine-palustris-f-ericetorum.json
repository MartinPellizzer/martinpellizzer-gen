    "intro": "Helleborine palustris f. ericetorum, commonly known as the bog helleborine, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to wetland habitats in Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant thrives in acidic, boggy soils and is often found in heathland or peat moss environments. Its morphology is adapted to its moist, nutrient-poor habitat, with a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in soft, waterlogged ground. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
