    "intro": "Hedysarum mogianicum, commonly known as the Mogiana milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in grasslands and open woodlands. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in early spring. Hedysarum mogianicum is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root system. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a forage plant for grazing animals and its contribution to soil fertility."
