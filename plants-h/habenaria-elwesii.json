    "intro": "Habenaria elwesii, commonly known as the Elwes' orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and pairs of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with prominent yellow lips, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
