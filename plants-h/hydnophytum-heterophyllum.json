    "intro": "Hydnophytum heterophyllum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It lacks true leaves and instead relies on its modified stems for photosynthesis, which are often covered in a dense, spongy layer that absorbs moisture from the air. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, making it a striking yet elusive species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species."
