    "intro": "Hoya padangensis, commonly known as the Padang Hoya, is a species of flowering plant native to Indonesia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tropical rainforests. Its flowers typically bloom in shades of white, pink, or red, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture. Hoya padangensis prefers indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
