    "intro": "Helictotrichon tibeticum var. suffuscum, commonly known as the Tibetan hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hair-like leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the extreme conditions of its alpine habitat. This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in high-altitude ecosystems."
