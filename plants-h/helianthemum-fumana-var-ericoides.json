    "intro": "Helianthemum fumana var. ericoides, commonly known as the coastal ericaceous helianthemum, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western Mediterranean. It features dense, leathery foliage with bright green, oval leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is adapted to coastal and rocky environments. This variety is closely related to other members of the Cistaceae family and is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
