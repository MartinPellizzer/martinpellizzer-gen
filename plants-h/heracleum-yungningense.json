    "intro": "Heracleum yungningense, commonly known as Yungning giant hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its large, compound leaves and tall, flowering stems. It is native to China, specifically the Yungning region, and is known for its impressive size, with some specimens reaching heights of over 3 meters. The plant produces white to greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-like clusters, a typical feature of the carrot family. It has a taproot system and can thrive in moist, shaded environments. Due to its potential to cause skin irritation from its sap, it is considered a potentially invasive species in certain regions."
