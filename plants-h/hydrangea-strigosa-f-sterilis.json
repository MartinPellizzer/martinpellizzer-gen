This plant is native to the eastern United States, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its foliage is typically dense and dark green, with a rough texture that gives it its common name. It is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. While it does not produce blooms, it is valued for its ornamental foliage and ecological benefits."
