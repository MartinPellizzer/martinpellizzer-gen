    "intro": "Hemionitis hysbaldii, commonly known as the mountain hysbald, is a rare and delicate fern found in specific alpine habitats. It has delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
