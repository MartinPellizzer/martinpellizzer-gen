    "intro": "Hermione trewiana, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and delicate, fragrant blooms that appear in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Its unique morphology includes long, slender leaves and a compact, upright growth habit. Due to habitat loss, Hermione trewiana is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
