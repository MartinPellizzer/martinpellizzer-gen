    "intro": "Herniaria incana subsp. pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense mats of prostrate stems covered with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system and succulent tissues that help retain moisture. Its botanical features make it a characteristic species of sandy and gravelly soils in dry habitats."
