    "intro": "Heteropterys anceps, commonly known as the red-flowered huito, is a member of the Malvaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting a variety of pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Heteropterys anceps is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local medicine."
