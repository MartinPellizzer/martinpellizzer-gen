    "intro": "Hymenophyllum floribundum, commonly known as the flowering fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, clustered spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and high air humidity to flourish. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in greenhouses and shaded gardens."
