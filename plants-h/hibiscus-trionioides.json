    "intro": "Hibiscus trionioides, commonly known as the swamp hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and marshes, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture, while its stems are covered in fine hairs. Hibiscus trionioides plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly as a nectar source for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
