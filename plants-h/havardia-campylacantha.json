It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces small, round, yellow fruits that are edible for some animals but not typically for humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
