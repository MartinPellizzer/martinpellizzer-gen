    "intro": "Helleborus antiquorum, commonly known as the Persian hellebore, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves and its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from deep purple to white. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. It produces toxic compounds, including cardioglycosides, which make it potentially harmful if ingested. Helleborus antiquorum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
