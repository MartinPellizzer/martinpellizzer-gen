    "intro": "Hieracium poecilophylloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. Hieracium poecilophylloides is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it both a common weed and a subject of ecological study."
