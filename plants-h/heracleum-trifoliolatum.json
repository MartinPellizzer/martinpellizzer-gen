    "intro": "Heracleum trifoliolatum, commonly known as the three-leaved cowparsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters. The leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and are often finely divided, giving the plant a delicate, fern-like appearance. Its flowers are small, white or greenish-white, and arranged in flat-topped umbels, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils."
