It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typical sunflower-like structure. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces yellow ray florets and a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract various pollinators. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat."
