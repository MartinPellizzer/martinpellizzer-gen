It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its medicinal properties, similar to other Hypericum species, have been studied for their potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects."
