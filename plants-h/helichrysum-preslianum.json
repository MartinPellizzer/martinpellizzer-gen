    "intro": "Helichrysum preslianum, commonly known as the Cape goldcup, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that resemble miniature sunflowers. The plant produces small, papery bracts that persist after the flowers have faded, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to retain color for extended periods, even when dried."
