    "intro": "Hieracium subnitidum, commonly known as the silky hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, silvery-hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. Hieracium subnitidum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
