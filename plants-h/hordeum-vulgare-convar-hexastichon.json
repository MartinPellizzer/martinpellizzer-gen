    "intro": "Hordeum vulgare convar. hexastichon, commonly known as six-row barley, is a variant of barley characterized by its six rows of kernels along the stem. It is a herbaceous annual plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a compact, spike-like inflorescence. Its grains are enclosed in husks and are primarily cultivated for their high nutritional value and use in food and animal feed. This variety is well adapted to a range of soil types and is often grown in cooler climates."
