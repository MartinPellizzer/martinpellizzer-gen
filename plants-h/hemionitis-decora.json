    "intro": "Hemionitis decora, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the western United States. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are divided into narrow segments, giving it a delicate appearance. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, rounded structures. Hemionitis decora is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
