    "intro": "Heracleum sibiricum proles lecoqii, commonly known as Siberian cowparsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and umbellate flowers. It is a biennial plant that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils across temperate regions. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, which are followed by finely divided, feathery seeds. Its leaves are broadly triangular with a rough texture, and the stems are hollow and often covered in fine hairs. It is often mistaken for other members of the carrot family due to its similar appearance."
