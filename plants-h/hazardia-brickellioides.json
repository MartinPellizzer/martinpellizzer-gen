    "intro": "Hazardia brickellioides, commonly known as desert star, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its hairy leaves and compact growth habit help reduce water loss, making it well-suited for harsh climates. Hazardia brickellioides is often found in open habitats and can serve as a food source for various insects and small animals."
