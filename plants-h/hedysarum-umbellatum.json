    "intro": "Hedysarum umbellatum, commonly known as the sweet vernal grass, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in grasslands, open woodlands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are often mistaken for grass due to their slender appearance. Its leaves are alternate, trifoliate, and have a soft, hairy texture. Hedysarum umbellatum is known for its early blooming season and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
