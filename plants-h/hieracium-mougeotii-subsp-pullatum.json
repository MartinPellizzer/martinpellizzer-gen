    "intro": "Hieracium mougeotii subsp. pullatum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high altitudes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme conditions."
