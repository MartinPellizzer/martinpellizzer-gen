    "intro": "Heleochloa compacta, commonly known as the compact hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments in the southeastern United States. It forms dense, mat-like growths with short, stiff blades that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically inconspicuous and wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in moist habitats. Heleochloa compacta is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate frequent flooding and poor soil conditions."
