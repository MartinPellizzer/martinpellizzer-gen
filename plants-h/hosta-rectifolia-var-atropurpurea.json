    "intro": "Hosta rectifolia var. atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple-leafed straightleaf hosta, is a striking varietal of the hosta plant native to Japan. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that exhibit a deep purple to bronze coloration, especially when exposed to full sun. The foliage tends to remain relatively upright, giving the plant a neat and compact appearance. It produces small, fragrant white flowers on tall, slender stems during the summer months. This variety is well-suited for shade gardens and adds a dramatic visual contrast with its vibrant leaf color."
