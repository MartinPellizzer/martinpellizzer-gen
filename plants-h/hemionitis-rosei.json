    "intro": "Hemionitis rosei, commonly known as the rose pogostemon, is a unique aquatic plant native to the wetlands of southern China and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Hemionitis rosei thrives in shallow, still water and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
