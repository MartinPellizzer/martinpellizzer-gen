    "intro": "Hemitelia rudimentaris, commonly known as the rudimentary hemitelia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are often pink or purple in color. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under the canopy of dense forests. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hemitelia rudimentaris is considered a species of conservation concern."
