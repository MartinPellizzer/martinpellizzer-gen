    "intro": "Harrisia taylorii, commonly known as Taylor's nightshade, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible but have a strong, tangy flavor. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Its nocturnal blooming habit is an adaptation to avoid daytime heat and conserve moisture."
