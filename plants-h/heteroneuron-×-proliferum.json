    "intro": "Heteroneuron \u00d7 proliferum, commonly known as the hybrid sweet flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It features long, slender rhizomes that help it spread vegetatively and establish dense colonies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a wetland indicator species and its use in traditional medicine. The hybrid nature of Heteroneuron \u00d7 proliferum results from the cross between Heteroneuron juncoides and Heteroneuron proliferum, contributing to its adaptability and ecological resilience."
