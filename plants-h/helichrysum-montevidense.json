    "intro": "Helichrysum montevidense, commonly known as the Montevidense immortelle, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Uruguay and parts of Brazil. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a unique texture. Its foliage is typically gray-green and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Helichrysum montevidense is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
