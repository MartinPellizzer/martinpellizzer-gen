    "intro": "Hydrocotyle burmanica subsp. handelii, commonly known as Burmese water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features floating leaves with a distinctive lobed shape and a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily within its habitat."
