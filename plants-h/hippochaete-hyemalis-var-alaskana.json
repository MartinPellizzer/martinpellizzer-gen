    "intro": "Hippochaete hyemalis var. alaskana, commonly known as the Alaska winter dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, cold climates. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. The flowers produce small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in the plant's survival in its extreme habitat."
