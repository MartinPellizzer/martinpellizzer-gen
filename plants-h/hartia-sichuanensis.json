    "intro": "Hartia sichuanensis, commonly known as the Sichuan hartia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 2,000 meters. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Hartia sichuanensis is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
