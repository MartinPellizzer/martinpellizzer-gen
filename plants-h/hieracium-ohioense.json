    "intro": "Hieracium ohioense, commonly known as Ohio hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with basal leaves that are broadly lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its yellow flowers bloom from June to September, and it is often found in open woods, meadows, and along roadsides. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
