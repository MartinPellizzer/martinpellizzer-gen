It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow composite flowers. The plant thrives in wet or marshy habitats, often found near water bodies such as lakes and rivers. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem. This subspecies is noted for its ecological importance in supporting local insect populations and stabilizing wetland soils."
