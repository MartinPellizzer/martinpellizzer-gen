    "intro": "Helicia tibetensis, commonly known as the Tibetan helicia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Tibet. It belongs to the family Theaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and showy, pale yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky or forested areas, and is adapted to cold and arid conditions. Its flowers bloom in spring, and the plant produces small, round berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Helicia tibetensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
