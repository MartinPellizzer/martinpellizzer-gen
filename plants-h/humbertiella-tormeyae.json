    "intro": "Humbertiella tormeyae, commonly known as the Tormey's rock cress, is a small flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many species of flowering plants known for their cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, cold environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and appear in clusters, contributing to its ornamental appeal in alpine gardens."
