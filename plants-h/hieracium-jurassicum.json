    "intro": "Hieracium jurassicum, commonly known as the Jurassic hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers and basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It has a hairy stem and produces small, oblong seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its historical presence in the Jurassic period, it is a subject of interest in paleobotanical studies."
