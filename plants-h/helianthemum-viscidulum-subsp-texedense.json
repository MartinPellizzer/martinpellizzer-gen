    "intro": "Helianthemum viscidulum subsp. texedense, commonly known as the Texas sandverbena, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of Texas and New Mexico. It features small, fuzzy, yellowish-green leaves and produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant. It blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
