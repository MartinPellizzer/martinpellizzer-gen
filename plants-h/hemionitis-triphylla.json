    "intro": "Hemionitis triphylla, commonly known as the three-leafed fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are usually less than 10 inches in length and have a soft, grass-like texture. Hemionitis triphylla is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants, making it a common sight in humid, temperate regions."
