    "intro": "Hieracium discoloratum, commonly known as the variable hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can form dense mats due to its creeping growth habit. Its leaves are usually alternate, rough to the touch, and have a distinctive serrated edge. The flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
