It is a grass species native to various regions of the Mediterranean and Middle East. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and has slender, erect stems with small, spikelet-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This species is valued for its genetic diversity and potential use in breeding programs to improve agricultural barley varieties."
