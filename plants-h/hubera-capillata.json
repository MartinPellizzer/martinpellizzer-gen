    "intro": "Hubera capillata, commonly known as the silky broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its yellowish, tubular flowers. The plant produces small, sticky seeds that are dispersed by wind or animals. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a common weed in agricultural areas. Its parasitic nature makes it a challenge for crop growers."
