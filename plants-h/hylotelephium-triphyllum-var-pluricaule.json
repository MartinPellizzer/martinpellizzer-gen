    "intro": "Hylotelephium triphyllum var. pluricaule, commonly known as the purple sandverbena, is a perennial succulent native to the southwestern United States. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, pinkish-purple flowers in the summer months, typically arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an adaptable and low-maintenance plant for arid environments."
