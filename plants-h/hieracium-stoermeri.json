    "intro": "Hieracium stoermeri, commonly known as Stoermer's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are basal, rough, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. Stoermer's hawkweed is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas, making it both a common weed and a subject of ecological study."
