    "intro": "Hybanthus arenarius, commonly known as the sand hybanthus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is a small, herbaceous annual plant that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals, which bloom in clusters near the top of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The species is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in areas with low rainfall."
