It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and open areas, thriving in full sun. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological diversity. Hypochaeris dubia is also used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
