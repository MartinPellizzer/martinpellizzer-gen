    "intro": "Hymenophyllum pyriforme, commonly known as the kidney fern, is a small, delicate fern that belongs to the Hymenophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Hymenophyllum pyriforme is notable for its high water retention ability, which helps it survive in humid, low-light conditions."
