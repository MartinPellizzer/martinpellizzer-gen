    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum var. retzii, commonly known as the lesser hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with a basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow-orange composite flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped, often with serrated edges, and the plant produces small, oval seeds in a disk-like arrangement. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. This species is noted for its ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction."
