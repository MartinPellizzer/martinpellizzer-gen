    "intro": "Haplopappus fonckii, commonly known as the desert pappus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive foliage. The plant has gray-green, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, and it produces lightweight seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Haplopappus fonckii is well-suited to xerophytic conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat."
