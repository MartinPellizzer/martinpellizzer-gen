    "intro": "Hieracium nitidifolium, commonly known as the smoothleaf hawkweed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and basal leaves that are typically oval and smooth on the upper surface. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Native to Europe, it is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
