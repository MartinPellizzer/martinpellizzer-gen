    "intro": "Habenaria humistrata, commonly known as the lowland orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a few leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered at the top. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitats."
