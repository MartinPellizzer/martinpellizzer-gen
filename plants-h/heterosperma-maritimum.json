    "intro": "Heterosperma maritimum, commonly known as sea spurry, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in coastal areas and saline soils. The plant has alternate, pinnately lobed leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in racemes. Its fruits are dry, dehiscent pods that release seeds through a mechanism involving the tension of the pod walls. Heterosperma maritimum is adapted to salty environments and is often found in dunes and tidal zones."
