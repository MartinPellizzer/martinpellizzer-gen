    "intro": "Helianthemum montanum var. canum, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hair, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
