    "intro": "Hedlundia minima, commonly known as the dwarf hedlundia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Hedlundia minima is often found in dune environments and is valued for its resilience and ornamental appeal."
