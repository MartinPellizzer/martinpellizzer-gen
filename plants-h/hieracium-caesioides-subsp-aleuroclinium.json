    "intro": "Hieracium caesioides subsp. aleuroclinium, commonly known as the silverleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray leaves and yellow flowering heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, which attract various pollinators. The subspecies is distinguished by its pale, almost whitish coloration of the leaves and flower heads, setting it apart from other hawkweed species."
