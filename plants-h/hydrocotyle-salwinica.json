    "intro": "Hydrocotyle salwinica, commonly known as the Salwin water pennywort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has small, round leaves that are often floating or submerged, and it produces small white flowers during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats on the water surface. Hydrocotyle salwinica plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
