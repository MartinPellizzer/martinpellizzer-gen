    "intro": "Homalobus plummerae, commonly known as the Moorea mint, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lamiaceae. It is native to the island of Moorea in French Polynesia, where it grows in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated margin. Its small, tubular flowers are typically violet or blue, arranged in dense clusters at the leaf axils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Homalobus plummerae is considered a rare and endangered species."
