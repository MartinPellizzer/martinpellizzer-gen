    "intro": "Hymenaea stigonocarpa var. pubescens, commonly known as the yellow rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, pod-like fruits containing flat, elliptical seeds. It is valued for its dense, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
