    "intro": "Heracleum \u00d7 rodnense, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a hybrid plant species in the carrot family (Apiaceae). It is characterized by its massive, umbrella-like white flower heads and large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to three feet in diameter. The plant contains phototoxic sap that can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, it has become an invasive species in North America. Due to its hazardous properties, it is often classified as a noxious weed and requires careful handling."
