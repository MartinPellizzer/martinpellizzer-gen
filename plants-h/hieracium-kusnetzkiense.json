    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracesium kusnetzkiense, commonly known as Kusnetzki's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
