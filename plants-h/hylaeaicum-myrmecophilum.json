    "intro": "Hylaeaicum myrmecophilum, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a unique species that forms a symbiotic relationship with ants. This plant provides shelter and food for ants through specialized structures called domatia, which are hollow spaces within its stems. In return, the ants protect the plant from herbivores and competing plants. The plant's leaves are typically small and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps in water conservation. Hylaeaicum myrmecophilum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments."
