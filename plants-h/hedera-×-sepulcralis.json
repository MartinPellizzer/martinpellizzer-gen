    "intro": "Hedera \u00d7 sepulcralis, commonly known as the black ivy, is a hybrid species of ivy that originates from the cross between Hedera helix and Hedera rhombea. It is characterized by its dark, almost black foliage, which gives it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are not particularly showy, followed by orange-red berries. It is a climbing plant that thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
