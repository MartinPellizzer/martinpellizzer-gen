    "intro": "Hemicrepidospermum rhoifolium, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, translucent, waxy leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom at night. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to survive. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
