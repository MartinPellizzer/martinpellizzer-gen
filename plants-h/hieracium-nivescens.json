    "intro": "Hieracium nivescens, commonly known as snow devil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cold, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Hieracium nivescens is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and medicinal properties in some species."
