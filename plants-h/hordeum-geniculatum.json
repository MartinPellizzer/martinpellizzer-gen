    "intro": "Hordeum geniculatum, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a species of grass native to North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and slender, blue-green blades. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Hordeum geniculatum is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
