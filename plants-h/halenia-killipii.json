    "intro": "Halenia killipii, commonly known as the Killip's halenia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth texture, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink.
