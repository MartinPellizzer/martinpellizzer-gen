    "intro": "Hypolytrum longiscaposum, commonly known as the long-stemmed swamp lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in wetland and swampy environments. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with three petals and three sepals, typically in shades of yellow and orange. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to purify water in aquatic habitats."
