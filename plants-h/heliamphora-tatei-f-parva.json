    "intro": "Heliamphora tatei f. parva, commonly known as the dwarf sun pitcher, is a carnivorous plant native to the tepuis of South America. It belongs to the Sarraceniaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pitcher-shaped leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in humid, nutrient-poor environments, often found in rocky or acidic soils. Its small size and specialized morphology make it a fascinating subject for botanical study. The f. parva form is a compact variant, distinguishing it from the standard H. tatei."
