    "intro": "Habenaria blephariglottis f. holopetala, commonly known as the broad-leaved marsh helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its large, ovate leaves and showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes and swamps. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds. The holopetala form is distinguished by its fully developed petals, which are broader than those of the typical form."
