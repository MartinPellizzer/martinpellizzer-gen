    "intro": "Hoya papillantha, commonly known as the waxy hoya, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in small, raised bumps, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Hoya papillantha is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light. It is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and ornamental appeal."
