It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences. Native to Europe, it thrives in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant has rough, glandular surfaces that may deter herbivores. Its flowering period typically occurs from late spring to early autumn."
