    "intro": "Humboltia uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower humboldtia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its unique, solitary flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are usually broad and oval, with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that ripen to a dark purple color. Humboltia uniflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
