    "intro": "Hypolepis rugulosa, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, rusty-brown hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with serrated leaflets that contribute to its ornamental value. Hypolepis rugulosa is valued in horticulture for its unique foliage and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
