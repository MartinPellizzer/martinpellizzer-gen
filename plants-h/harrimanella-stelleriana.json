    "intro": "Harrimanella stelleriana, commonly known as the Steller's harrimanella, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes familiar plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats. Due to its limited range and sensitivity to habitat disturbance, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
