    "intro": "Houstonia chlorantha, commonly known as the green bluemont, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has delicate, hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with a bluish hue. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
