    "intro": "Huperzia quadriforiata, commonly known as the four-leaf huperzia, is a species of moss-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its simple, branching structure and small, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in a whorl. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its leaf-like structures. Huperzia quadriforiata is notable for its ability to thrive in humid climates and its role in soil stabilization in its native habitats."
