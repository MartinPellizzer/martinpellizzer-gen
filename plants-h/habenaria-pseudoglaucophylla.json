    "intro": "Habenaria pseudoglaucophylla, commonly known as the false glaucophyll orchid, is a species of orchid belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, which are typically borne on the upper part of the stem. It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and less commonly cultivated orchid."
