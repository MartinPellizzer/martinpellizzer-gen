    "intro": "Hyalosema cominsii, commonly known as the Comins' hyalosema, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Malvaceae family. It is native to specific regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in the Philippines, where it grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and small, pale flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its botanical features include a woody stem and fibrous roots, which help it survive in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
