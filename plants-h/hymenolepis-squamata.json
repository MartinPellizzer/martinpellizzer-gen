    "intro": "Hymenolepis squamata, commonly known as the scaly tapeworm, is a parasitic flatworm belonging to the class Cestoda. It is characterized by its segmented body and absence of a digestive system, relying entirely on absorbing nutrients from its host's intestines. The adult worms typically reside in the intestines of rodents, particularly mice, and can grow up to several centimeters in length. Its life cycle involves an intermediate host, such as a flea, which serves as a vector for transmission to the definitive host. The morphology of Hymenolepis squamata includes a scolex with hooks and a strobila composed of multiple proglottids."
