    "intro": "Hysterobaeckea tuberculata, commonly known as the rough-hairy wattle, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, hairy, glandular stipules. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Hysterobaeckea tuberculata is often used in revegetation projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
