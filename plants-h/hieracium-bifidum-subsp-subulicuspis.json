    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. subulicuspis, commonly known as the narrow-cusp hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are lanceolate to linear, often with a hairy surface, and the flowers are yellow, arranged in a single head. This subspecies is distinguished by its narrow, acuminate cuspules on the involucre, contributing to its specific taxonomic classification."
