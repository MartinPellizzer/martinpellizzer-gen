    "intro": "Hariota cereuscula, commonly known as the dwarf cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments. Hariota cereuscula is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
