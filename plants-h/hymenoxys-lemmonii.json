    "intro": "Hymenoxys lemmonii, commonly known as the Lemmon's globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as rocky slopes and dry grasslands. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are clustered in globular inflorescences, which are characteristic of the Malvaceae family. Its leaves are palmately divided, with five to seven lobes, and the stems are often covered in fine, hairy structures. Hymenoxys lemmonii is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
