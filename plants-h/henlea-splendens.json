    "intro": "Henlea splendens, commonly known as the golden flame plant, is a striking evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn a vibrant yellow or orange during the flowering season. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
