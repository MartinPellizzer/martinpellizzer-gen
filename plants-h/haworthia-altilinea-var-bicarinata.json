    "intro": "Haworthia altilinea var. bicarinata, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves with distinctive white to light green markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The leaves are typically short and broad, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. This plant thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or indoor cultivation."
