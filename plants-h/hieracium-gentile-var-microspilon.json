It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, with basal leaves that are lanceolate and often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces yellow composite flowers, which are typically arranged in a single head and surrounded by involucral bracts. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental appearance and ecological adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but can become invasive in certain regions."
