    "intro": "Heliosperma quadrifidum subsp. carpaticum, commonly known as the Carpathian sunspider, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the Carpathian Mountains. It is a perennial herb with a short, upright stem and small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces yellowish flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
