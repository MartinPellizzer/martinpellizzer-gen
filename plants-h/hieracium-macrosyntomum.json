    "intro": "Hieracium macrosyntomum, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a robust root system and can form dense colonies, often dominating grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are usually hairy as well. Hieracium macrosyntomum is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature."
