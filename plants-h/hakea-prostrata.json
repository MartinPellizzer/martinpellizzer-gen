    "intro": "Hakea prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate hakea, is a low-growing shrub native to Western Australia. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapting to the arid conditions of its natural habitat. The plant produces small, spherical yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody stems are typically prostrate or spreading, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Hakea prostrata is well-suited for coastal and sandy soils, making it a popular choice for landscaping in drought-prone areas."
