It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces numerous ray florets that are often surrounded by a dense cluster of disk flowers. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
