    "intro": "Hebe topiaria, commonly known as the silver leaf hebe, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a unique, ornamental appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, typically in spring. Hebe topiaria is well-suited for rock gardens or as a topiary plant due to its ability to be shaped. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot."
