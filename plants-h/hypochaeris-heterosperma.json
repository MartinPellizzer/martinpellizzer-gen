    "intro": "Hypochaeris heterosperma, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. Its yellow flowers bloom in the spring and summer, and it produces numerous small, elongated seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hypochaeris heterosperma is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various environments."
