    "intro": "Hypericum quadrangulum var. imperforatum, commonly known as the smooth St. John's wort, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically smooth and lack the typical leaf notches found in other varieties. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers with four petals, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas or along woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
