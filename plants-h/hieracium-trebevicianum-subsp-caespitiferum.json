    "intro": "Hieracium trebevicianum subsp. caespitiferum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and eastern Europe. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, forming dense, low-growing mats. The plant has alternate, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are yellow, with a distinctive ray floret structure. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread across various habitats. Due to its aggressive growth, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
