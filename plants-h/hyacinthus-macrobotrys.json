It produces fragrant, dense clusters of violet or white flowers during late winter to early spring. The plant features strap-like, grassy leaves that emerge from a bulb and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. Its flowers are pollinated by insects and can be used to make perfumes. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and its ability to bloom early in the season."
