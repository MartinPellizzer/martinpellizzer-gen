    "intro": "Haplopteris capillaris, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Haplopteris capillaris is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, preferring humid and cool climates."
