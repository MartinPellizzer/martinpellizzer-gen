    "intro": "Hieracium tuadaschense, commonly known as the Tuadaschense hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. It features a basal rosette of leaves with hairy surfaces and produces yellow flowers in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
