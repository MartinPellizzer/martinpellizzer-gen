    "intro": "Hieracium adenopsilon, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Its flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. The plant's hairy leaves and stems provide it with some drought tolerance and help in reducing water loss."
