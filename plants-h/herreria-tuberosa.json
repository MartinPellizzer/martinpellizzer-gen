It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant is known for its tuberous roots, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.
