It is characterized by its cylindrical stems and the ability to produce vibrant, star-shaped flowers at night. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and they emit a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
