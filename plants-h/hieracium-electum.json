    "intro": "Hieracium electum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. The plant has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the upper leaves are smaller and more upright. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
