    "intro": "Hymenophysa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Hymenophysa typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
