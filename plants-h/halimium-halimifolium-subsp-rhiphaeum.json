    "intro": "Halimium halimifolium subsp. rhiphaeum, commonly known as the rock rose, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry, sunny habitats. Its leaves are small, leathery, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscaping."
