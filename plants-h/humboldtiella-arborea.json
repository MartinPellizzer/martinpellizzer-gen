    "intro": "Humboldtiella arborea, commonly known as the tree of heaven, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and often have a distinctive, serrated edge. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by winged fruits that aid in its dispersal. Humboldtiella arborea is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both sunny and partially shaded environments. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it an important species in ecological succession."
