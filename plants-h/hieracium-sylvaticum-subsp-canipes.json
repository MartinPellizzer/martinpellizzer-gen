    "intro": "Hieracium sylvaticum subsp. canipes, commonly known as the woodland hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowering stems bear yellow composite flowers, which are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and growth habit compared to other Hieracium species."
