It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, woody stems and lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its medicinal properties, similar to other Hypericum species, have been studied for their potential anti-inflammatory and antidepressant effects."
