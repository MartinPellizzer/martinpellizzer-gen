It features dense rosettes of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or pale blue markings. The leaves are often adorned with prominent, translucent windows that allow light to penetrate deep into the plant.

This variety is prized for its compact size and unique aesthetic, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
