    "intro": "Hieracium hypochoeroides subsp. terrei, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosettes of leaves, which help it survive in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in several European countries."
