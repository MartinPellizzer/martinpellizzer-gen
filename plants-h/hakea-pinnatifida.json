    "intro": "Hakea pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers, which are typically borne on spikes during the spring and summer months. Hakea pinnatifida is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, featuring a deep root system to access water. It is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
