It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Heliotropium persicum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
