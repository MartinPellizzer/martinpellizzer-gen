It is characterized by its yellowish-orange composite flowers and hairy, often lobed leaves. Native to Europe, it has been introduced to other regions and is considered an invasive species in some areas. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can form dense mats, outcompeting native vegetation. Its botanical features make it a notable species in ecological studies and weed management."
