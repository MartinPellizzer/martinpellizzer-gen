    "intro": "Hippion aestivum, commonly known as summer hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. Hippion aestivum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and coastal areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
