It is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellowish-orange composite flowers that bloom in the summer months. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Native to Europe, this subspecies is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is relatively low maintenance in garden settings."
