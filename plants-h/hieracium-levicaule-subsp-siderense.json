    "intro": "Hieracium levicaule subsp. siderense, commonly known as the ironweed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features upright stems that are usually hairy, with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It produces small, oblong achenes that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
