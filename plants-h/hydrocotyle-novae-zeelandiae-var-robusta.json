    "intro": "Hydrocotyle novae-zeelandiae var. robusta, commonly known as the New Zealand water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to New Zealand. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has floating leaves that are heart-shaped with a waxy surface, and it produces small white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its rhizomes help it spread and form dense mats on the water surface. The species is valued for its role in aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
