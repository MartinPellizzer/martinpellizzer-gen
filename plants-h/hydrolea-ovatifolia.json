    "intro": "Hydrolea ovatifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf hydrolea, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Hydrolea ovatifolia is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying properties. It thrives in humid, well-drained soil and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth."
