    "intro": "Heterotropa muramatsui, commonly known as the Muramatsu's heterotropa, is a rare flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and elliptical leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that emit a faint fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. It is typically found in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
