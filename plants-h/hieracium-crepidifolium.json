    "intro": "Hieracium crepidifolium, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow ray florets surrounded by tubular disk flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is found in temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It has a creeping growth habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
