    "intro": "Hibiscus tiliifolius, commonly known as the Hawaiian hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, including Hawaii, Tahiti, and the Society Islands. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, featuring palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom in the summer months. Its flowers are typically followed by distinctive three-lobed seed pods that split open to release the seeds. Hibiscus tiliifolius is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some Pacific cultures."
