    "intro": "Humboltia microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved humboldtia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline, where it thrives in a maritime climate with high salinity and strong winds. Humboltia microphylla has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid coastal habitat. Its flowers, which are usually pink or purple, bloom in clusters and attract a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
