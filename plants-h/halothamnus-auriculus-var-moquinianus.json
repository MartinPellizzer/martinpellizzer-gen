    "intro": "Halothamnus auriculus var. moquinianus, commonly known as the Moquin's goldenbush, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, yellowish-green leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, which bloom in early spring. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats. This variety is notable for its resilience and ability to thrive in extreme conditions with minimal water."
