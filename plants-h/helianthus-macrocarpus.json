    "intro": "Helianthus macrocarpus, commonly known as the smooth coneflower, is a perennial herb native to the central and eastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has rough, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. Its fruit is a cylindrical, spiky capsule that contains numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Helianthus macrocarpus is often found in open woods, prairies, and along roadsides, and it serves as a valuable nectar source for pollinators."
