    "intro": "Hemistylus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to saline and sandy environments. They are characterized by their distinctive, often spiny, bracts that surround the small flower heads. The leaves are usually linear and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Hemistylus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in coastal ecosystems."
