    "intro": "Heliotropium tytoides, commonly known as the stinging heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often resembling those of true heliotropes. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, and its flowers typically open in the morning, closing at night. It is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and is often found in disturbed areas. One notable feature is the presence of fine, stinging hairs on its stems and leaves, which can cause irritation upon contact."
