It is a small, herbaceous plant with delicate, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
