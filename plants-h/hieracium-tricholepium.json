    "intro": "Hieracium tricholepium, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems, which give it its common name. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this perennial plant typically grows in meadows and grasslands. The leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insects."
