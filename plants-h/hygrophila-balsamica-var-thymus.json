It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The variety 'thymus' is distinguished by its more pronounced thyme-like scent compared to other variants."
