    "intro": "Hermodactylus calatajeronensis, commonly known as the Socotra starfish flower, is a unique flowering plant native to the Socotra archipelago. It is characterized by its star-shaped, fleshy, and brightly colored flowers that resemble a starfish, hence its common name. The plant has a succulent stem and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. It blooms during the rainy season, producing clusters of flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
