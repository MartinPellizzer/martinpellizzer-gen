    "intro": "Himantoglossum calcaratum, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and specialized plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, spurred flowers that are typically pale green to yellowish in color. This plant thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. It is a perennial herb with a short, creeping rhizome and narrow, linear leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
