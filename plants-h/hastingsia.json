It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny environments such as coastal bluffs and grasslands. Hastingsia has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. It plays an important role in the ecosystems of its native habitat and is a symbol of California's natural beauty."
