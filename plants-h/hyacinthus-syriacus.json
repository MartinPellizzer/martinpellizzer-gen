    "intro": "Hyacinthus syriacus, commonly known as the garden hyacinth, is a bulbous plant belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the eastern Mediterranean region and is characterized by its compact, grass-like foliage and dense clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers. The flowers typically bloom in shades of purple, blue, white, or pink, depending on the cultivar. The plant produces a bulb that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive dormant periods and regrow each spring. It is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and is often used in gardens and floral arrangements."
