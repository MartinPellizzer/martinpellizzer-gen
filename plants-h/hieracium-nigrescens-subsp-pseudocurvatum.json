    "intro": "Hieracium nigrescens subsp. pseudocurvatum, commonly known as the black hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and along stream banks, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are broadly lance-shaped with a rough texture, and the flowers are yellow with a central disk. The subspecies pseudocurvatum is distinguished by its slightly curved leaf bases and a more compact growth habit compared to other members of the species."
