    "intro": "Holcus dochna, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tufted grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and wetlands. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, blade-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, compact flower clusters. Holcus dochna is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local insect populations."
