    "intro": "Helleborine americana, commonly known as the American helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and showy, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind, and it is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora. Helleborine americana is also known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
