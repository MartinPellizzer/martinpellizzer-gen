    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. obtextum, commonly known as the mouse-ear hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy, low-growing stems and small, yellowish flowers. The leaves are typically broad, lobed, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. This subspecies is noted for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes, making it a common weed in various habitats."
