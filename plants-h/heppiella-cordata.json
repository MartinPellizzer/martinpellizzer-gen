    "intro": "Heppiella cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf heppiella, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, often white or pale pink, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking native plants."
