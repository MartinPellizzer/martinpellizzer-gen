It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the leaves are usually lance-shaped with a hairy texture. Hieracium amauradenium is often considered a weed but can be found in gardens and natural habitats."
