    "intro": "Heteropappus holohermaphroditus, commonly known as the yellow globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its yellow, radially symmetrical flowers and its unique reproductive structure, as it is holohermaphroditic, meaning each flower contains both male and female reproductive organs. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs, while its stems are erect and branched. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to dry climates."
