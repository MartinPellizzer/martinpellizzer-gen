    "intro": "Hieracium pannonicum subsp. eumorphum, commonly known as the Eastern Marsh Hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and wetlands. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are hairy and lance-shaped, with a central stem that bears yellow flowers in a single head. Its flowers are surrounded by a series of phyllaries, which are leaf-like structures that protect the flower bud. This subspecies is characterized by its slender stem and relatively small, dandelion-like flowers."
