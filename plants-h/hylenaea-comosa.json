It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in coastal or inland regions. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Hylenaea comosa is adapted to arid conditions and is often found in shrubland or open woodland habitats."
