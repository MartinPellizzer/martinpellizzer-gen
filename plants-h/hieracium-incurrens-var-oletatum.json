It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
