It features broad, waxy, dark green leaves that are often marked with white or light green veins, creating a striking visual effect. The plant produces fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or lavender during the summer months. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for shade gardens. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its delicate, showy blooms."
