It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, yellow flowers in spring. The leaves are typically gray-green, covered in a fine layer of white powder, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
