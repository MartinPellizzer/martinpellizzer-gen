    "intro": "Hieracium erraticum, commonly known as the wandering hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It has hairy leaves and produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer. Hieracium erraticum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
