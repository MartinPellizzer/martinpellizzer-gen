    "intro": "Hieracium caesium subsp. denticulosum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and bright yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils. Its subspecies status reflects subtle differences in morphology, particularly in leaf and flower structures, compared to other members of the Hieracium genus."
