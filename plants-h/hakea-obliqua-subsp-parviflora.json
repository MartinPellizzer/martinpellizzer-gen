    "intro": "Hakea obliqua subsp. parviflora, commonly known as the slender hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Western Australia. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in spring. It is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in coastal gardens."
