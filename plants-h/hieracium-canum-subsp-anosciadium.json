    "intro": "Hieracium canum subsp. anosciadium, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring well-drained conditions. Its yellow flowers are usually clustered in a single head, with pale green or white ray florets surrounding the central disk. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller, more compact growth form compared to other hawkweed species."
