It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and slender spikelets that bear short, awn-like structures. This subspecies is typically found in temperate regions, often growing in grassy or disturbed soils. Its morphology reflects adaptations to specific environmental conditions, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies. The plant's structure and growth habits contribute to its ecological significance in certain habitats."
