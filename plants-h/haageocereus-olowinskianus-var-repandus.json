    "intro": "Haageocereus olowinskianus var. repandus, commonly known as the Olowinski's night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically ribbed and covered in white to pale green spines. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in arid gardens due to its drought tolerance."
