    "intro": "Hieracium doronicifolium subsp. doronicifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers in clusters, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
