    "intro": "Hieracium flocculosum var. denticulatum, commonly known as the denticulate hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, woolly stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in compact clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
