    "intro": "Hedysarum spinosissimum subsp. capitellatum, commonly known as the alpine vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny stems and compound leaves, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, giving it its subspecific name \"capitellatum.\" It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Hedysarum spinosissimum subsp. capitellatum plays a role in nitrogen fixation and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
