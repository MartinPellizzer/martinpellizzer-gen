    "intro": "Hordeum hrasdanicum, commonly known as wild barley, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a herbaceous plant that typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences. Its leaves are linear and covered with fine hairs, and it flowers in the spring. Hordeum hrasdanicum plays a role in ecological systems as a pioneer species and is also studied for its genetic relationship to cultivated barley."
