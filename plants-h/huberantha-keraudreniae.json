It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces a unique inflorescence that resembles a cluster of tiny stars. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
