It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats, preferring well-drained soils. Its botanical features include a slender, herbaceous stem and a unique floral structure that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
