It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a woody stem and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowering period typically occurs during the summer months, and it thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
