    "intro": "Hieracium levicaule subsp. radiosum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to central and eastern Europe. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, flat-topped clusters, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in certain regions."
