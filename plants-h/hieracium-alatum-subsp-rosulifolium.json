    "intro": "Hieracium alatum subsp. rosulifolium, commonly known as the rosette hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of basal leaves, which are typically hairy and have a distinctive lobed or toothed margin. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Due to its ornamental appearance and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
