    "intro": "Hebeclinium ehrenbergii, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. The plant's unique morphology and drought tolerance make it an attractive choice for low-maintenance gardens in desert regions."
