    "intro": "Heracleum sibiricum subsp. australe, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to the temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves and showy white flowers arranged in a complex inflorescence. The plant contains phototoxic sap that can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and roadsides. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many parts of the world."
