    "intro": "Hemimeris intermedia, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night. The plant is a shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its flowers emit a strong, sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat."
