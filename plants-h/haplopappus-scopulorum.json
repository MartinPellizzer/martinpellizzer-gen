It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. The small yellow flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
