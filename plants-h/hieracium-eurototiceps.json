    "intro": "Hieracium eurototiceps, commonly known as the European spearthorn, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rough, spiny leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to Europe, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has a taproot system and produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. It is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
