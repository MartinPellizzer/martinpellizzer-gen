    "intro": "Hieracium trebevicianum subsp. horridentiferum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow disk flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense, bristly hairs on the stems and leaves, which give it a rough texture. It typically thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. The plant produces small, elongated achenes with pappus for wind dispersal."
