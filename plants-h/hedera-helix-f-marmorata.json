    "intro": "Hedera helix f. marmorata, commonly known as the marble evergreen ivy, is a cultivar of the common ivy characterized by its striking variegated foliage. Its leaves are typically a mix of light green and white or cream, creating a marbled pattern that sets it apart from solid green varieties. This plant is a climbing vine that thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments, making it ideal for vertical gardening or as a ground cover. It prefers well-drained soil and moderate to high humidity, and it is relatively low maintenance once established. The marble evergreen ivy is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to climb walls or trellises."
