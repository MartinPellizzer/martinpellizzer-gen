It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptability."
