    "intro": "Helichrysum semipapposum var. filifolium, commonly known as the silky everlasting or woolly helichrysum, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flower heads that are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in its native habitat."
