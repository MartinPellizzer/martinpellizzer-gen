    "intro": "Hieracium elongatum subsp. subalpinum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features upright stems that are usually sparsely hairy, and its leaves are lance-shaped with rough textures. It produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early summer. This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth form and is often found in mountainous environments across the Alps and adjacent regions."
