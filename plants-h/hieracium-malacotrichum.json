It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers that are typically clustered in a single head. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered with fine, sticky hairs, which give it its common name. Hieracium malacotrichum is often found in grassy areas and can form dense colonies, making it a notable weed in some regions."
