    "intro": "Hieracium norrliniiforme, commonly known as the Norwegian hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and can be found in meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. Its yellow flowers bloom in late summer, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
