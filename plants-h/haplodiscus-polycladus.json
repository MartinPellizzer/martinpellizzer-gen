    "intro": "Haplodiscus polycladus, commonly known as the slender water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are usually submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its flowering stems emerge from the water, bearing small, inconspicuous flowers that are adapted for wind pollination. Haplodiscus polycladus plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and fish."
