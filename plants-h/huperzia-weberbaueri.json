It is characterized by its erect, branched stems covered with small, scale-like leaves. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Huperzia weberbaueri reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes a distinct gametophyte stage. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and air-purifying properties."
