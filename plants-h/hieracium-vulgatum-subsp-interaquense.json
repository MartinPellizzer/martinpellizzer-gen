It typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and riverbanks. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces yellow flowers in a dense, flat-topped inflorescence. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are hairy and often reddish in color. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to wet environments and its role in supporting local insect populations."
