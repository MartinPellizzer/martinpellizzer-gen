    "intro": "Haworthia scabra var. starkiana, commonly known as the Stark's Haworthia, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves with a distinctive textured surface and a pale green to bluish-gray coloration. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers on slender stems during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to maintain its compact shape. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
