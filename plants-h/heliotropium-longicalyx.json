    "intro": "Heliotropium longicalyx, commonly known as the long-stalked heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, violet or purple flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and gardens. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions for its delicate floral display."
