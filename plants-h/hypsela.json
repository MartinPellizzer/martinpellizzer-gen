    "intro": "Hypsela, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red, attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Hypsela thrives in moist soil and is often found near streams, marshes, and wet meadows. Its botanical name, Hypsela, is derived from the Greek word for \"high,\" possibly referring to its elevated growth habit in wet environments."
