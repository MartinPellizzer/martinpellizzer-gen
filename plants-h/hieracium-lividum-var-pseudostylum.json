    "intro": "Hieracium lividum var. pseudostylum, commonly known as the pale hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces yellow flowers in a composite head, which are typically arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
