    "intro": "Hakea goodii, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern and western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has adapted to sandy soils and salty coastal environments, making it highly resilient to harsh conditions. Its woody structure and ability to thrive in arid climates contribute to its ecological importance in coastal ecosystems. Hakea goodii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
