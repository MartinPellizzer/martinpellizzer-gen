    "intro": "Helichrysum gymnocephalum, commonly known as the naked-headed everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces numerous small, yellowish to brownish flowers that resemble tiny, dried flowers, giving it a long-lasting appearance. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically narrow and linear. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Helichrysum gymnocephalum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in floral arrangements due to its ability to retain color when dried."
