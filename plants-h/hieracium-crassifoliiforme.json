It is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically broad and fleshy. The plant produces bright yellow flowers arranged in dense, flat-topped clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
