    "intro": "Helichrysum sabulosum, commonly known as the sand everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, yellow to orange flowers that resemble daisies. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are often retained on the plant long after blooming, giving it a dried flower appearance. Helichrysum sabulosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
