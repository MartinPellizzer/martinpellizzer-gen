    "intro": "Hieracium racemosum subsp. barbicaule, commonly known as the barbed hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate in shape, with hairy surfaces. Its inflorescence consists of a tall, branched stem bearing numerous yellow flowers arranged in a raceme. The subspecies is distinguished by its barbed bracts, which give it its common name and aid in seed dispersal."
