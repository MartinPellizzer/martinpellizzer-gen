    "intro": "Hieracium mixtivillosum, commonly known as the mixed-hairy hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features basal rosettes of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers with ray florets. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
