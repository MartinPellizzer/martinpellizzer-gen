    "intro": "Heracleum dalgadianum, commonly known as the Dalgadian giant hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, umbrella-like inflorescences. It is native to Central Asia and is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils. The plant possesses large, palmately lobed leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces a large number of seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
