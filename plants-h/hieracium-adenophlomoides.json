    "intro": "Hieracium adenophlomoides, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are usually hairy, and the flowers are yellow, forming a cluster at the top of the stem. It is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
