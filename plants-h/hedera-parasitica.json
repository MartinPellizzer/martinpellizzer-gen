    "intro": "Hedera parasitica, commonly known as the climbing ivy, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to other plants for support and nutrients. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. Its dark green, lobed leaves are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants if left unchecked."
