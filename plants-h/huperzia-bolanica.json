It is characterized by its simple, needle-like leaves and a creeping growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. Native to arid and semi-arid regions of China, it thrives in well-drained, dry environments. The plant is notable for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient component of its ecosystem. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are typically clustered on the underside of its leaves."
