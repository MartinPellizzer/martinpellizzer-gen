    "intro": "Hydnophytum formicarum var. minor, commonly known as the ant plant, is a tropical epiphytic plant that forms a unique symbiotic relationship with ants. Its specialized structures, called domatia, provide shelter for colonies of ants, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores. The plant's leaves are modified into cup-like formations that house the ants, while its roots absorb nutrients from the surrounding environment. It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in humid, shaded environments. This fascinating plant showcases an intricate mutualistic relationship between plants and insects."
