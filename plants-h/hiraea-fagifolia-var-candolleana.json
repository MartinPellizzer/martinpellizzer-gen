    "intro": "Hiraea fagifolia var. candolleana, commonly known as the Candolleana hiraea, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its small, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded forest environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
