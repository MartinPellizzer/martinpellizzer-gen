It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
