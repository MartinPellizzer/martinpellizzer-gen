    "intro": "Hepetis latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf hepatica, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves and showy blue or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has a short growing season. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. The flowers bloom in early spring, often before the tree leaves have fully emerged."
