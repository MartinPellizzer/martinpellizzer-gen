    "intro": "Hydrocotyle quinqueloba var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments. It features heart-shaped, smooth leaves that are typically light to dark green, often floating on the water surface. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in shallow water and moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. This variant is distinguished by its smooth leaf surfaces, contrasting with the hairy leaves of the typical variety."
