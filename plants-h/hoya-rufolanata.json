    "intro": "Hoya rufolanata, commonly known as the red-veined hoya, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often variegated with red and green hues. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the summer months. Hoya rufolanata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance."
