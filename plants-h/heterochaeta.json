It is characterized by its composite flower heads, which consist of both ray and disk flowers. The leaves are typically alternate, lance-shaped, and have a rough texture. Heterochaeta species are often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. They play a role in pollination and provide food for various insects and small animals."
