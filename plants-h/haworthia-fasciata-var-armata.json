    "intro": "Haworthia fasciata var. armata, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves with distinct white or pale green markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces small, star-shaped white flowers on slender stems during the growing season. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to maintain its vibrant appearance. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
