    "intro": "Herminium esquirolii, commonly known as the slender twayblade, is a perennial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is a myco-heterotroph, meaning it derives its nutrients from fungi rather than through photosynthesis. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its unique ecological role makes it an interesting subject for botanical study."
