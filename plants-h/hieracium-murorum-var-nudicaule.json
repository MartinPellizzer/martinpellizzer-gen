    "intro": "Hieracium murorum var. nudicaule, commonly known as the naked-stem hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and waste areas. The plant features upright, hairy stems that are often reddish in color, with basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow, arranged in a composite head, and are surrounded by pale green bracts. The variety *nudicaule* is distinguished by its lack of leafy bracts, giving it a more streamlined appearance compared to other varieties of hawkweed."
