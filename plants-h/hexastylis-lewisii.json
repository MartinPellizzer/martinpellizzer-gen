    "intro": "Hexastylis lewisii, commonly known as Lewis's hooded tongue, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family, which is characterized by its unique, often tubular or hooded flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, while the flowers are greenish-white with a distinctive, hood-like structure. The plant's morphology reflects its adaptation to low-light conditions and its role in supporting local insect pollinators."
