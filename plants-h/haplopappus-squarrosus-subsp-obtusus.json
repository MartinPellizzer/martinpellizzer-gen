    "intro": "Haplopappus squarrosus subsp. obtusus, commonly known as the woolly pappus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its subspecies obtusus is distinguished by its more rounded leaf tips compared to other forms. This species is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, semi-desert conditions."
