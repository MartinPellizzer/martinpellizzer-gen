    "intro": "Hemionitis straminea, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a small evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features delicate, bright green, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats. Botanically, it is characterized by its unique, clustered sori that are covered with a protective indusium."
