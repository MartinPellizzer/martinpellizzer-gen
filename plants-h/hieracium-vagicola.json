    "intro": "Hieracium vagicola, commonly known as the coastal hawkweed, is a perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and coastal cliffs. It has hairy stems and leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Hieracium vagicola is adapted to salt spray and strong winds typical of coastal habitats."
