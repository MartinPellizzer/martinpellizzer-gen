    "intro": "Haemanthus spiralis, commonly known as the spiral haemanthus, is a striking South African plant characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is native to the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that spiral upward from a central point, creating an elegant, almost architectural appearance. Its flowers, which appear in late winter to early spring, are typically white or pale yellow and are clustered in a terminal umbel. Haemanthus spiralis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to rock gardens and coastal environments."
