    "intro": "Houstonia croftiae, commonly known as the Croft's bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes. Its blue to violet flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
