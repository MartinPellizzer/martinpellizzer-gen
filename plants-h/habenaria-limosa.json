    "intro": "Habenaria limosa, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense, dark green leaves. The plant produces a tall, spike of small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in a loose, raceme-like pattern. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
