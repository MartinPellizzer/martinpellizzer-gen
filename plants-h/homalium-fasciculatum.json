    "intro": "Homalium fasciculatum, commonly known as the clustered hollies, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in a whorled pattern along the stems. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in fascicles, giving it its scientific name. The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests."
