    "intro": "Hippocratea boinensis, commonly known as the Bornean orchid, is a tropical flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and plays a role in the biodiversity of its native habitat."
