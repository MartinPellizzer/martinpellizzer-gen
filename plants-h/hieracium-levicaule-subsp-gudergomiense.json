It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers with five petals. It is characterized by its compact stature and is often found in open habitats at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the genus Hieracium."
