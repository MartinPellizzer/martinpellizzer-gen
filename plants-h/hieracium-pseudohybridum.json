    "intro": "Hieracium pseudohybridum, commonly known as the false hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and can form dense colonies. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
