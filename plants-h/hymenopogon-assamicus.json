    "intro": "Hymenopogon assamicus, commonly known as the Assam hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the northeastern region of India. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, typical of many grass species, and its leaves are narrow and often hairy. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in grasslands and along the banks of streams. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
