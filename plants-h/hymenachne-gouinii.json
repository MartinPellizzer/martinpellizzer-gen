    "intro": "Hymenachne gouinii, commonly known as the Gouin's flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its flat, grass-like leaves and spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, where it thrives in saturated soil conditions. Hymenachne gouinii is often found in association with other aquatic or semi-aquatic vegetation, contributing to the structural complexity of these ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland biodiversity and ecological studies."
