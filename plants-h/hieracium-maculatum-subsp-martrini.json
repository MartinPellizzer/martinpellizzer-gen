    "intro": "Hieracium maculatum subsp. martrini, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy, often spotted leaves. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in some regions and can outcompete native vegetation."
