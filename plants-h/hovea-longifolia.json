    "intro": "Hovea longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved hovea, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Its fruit is a woody pod that splits open to release the seeds. Hovea longifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and floral display."
