    "intro": "Hieracium staturale, commonly known as the tall hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of 60 to 120 centimeters, with basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its yellow flowers appear in late summer, and the plant produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium staturale is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun."
