    "intro": "Hieracium trebevicianum subsp. subpleiophyllum, commonly known as the Balkan hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southeastern Europe. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and forest edges, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has basal rosettes of narrow, silver-green leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late spring to early summer. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology and flowering structure typical of the Asteraceae family. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range."
