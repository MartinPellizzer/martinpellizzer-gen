    "intro": "Heteroblemma formanii, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats, with small, needle-like leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. Heteroblemma formanii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
