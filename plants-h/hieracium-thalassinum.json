    "intro": "Hieracium thalassinum, commonly known as the sea hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, adapting to salty and windy conditions. It is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and produces both ray and disc florets. Hieracium thalassinum plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
