    "intro": "Humboltia krameriana, commonly known as the Kramer's humboldtia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a shrub that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in coastal areas with sandy soils. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Humboltia krameriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
