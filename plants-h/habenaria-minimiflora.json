    "intro": "Habenaria minimiflora, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a small terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces tiny, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers are borne on slender stems and are often clustered closely together. Due to its small size and ornamental appeal, it is popular among orchid enthusiasts and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
