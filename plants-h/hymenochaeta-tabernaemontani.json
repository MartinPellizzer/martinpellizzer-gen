    "intro": "Hymenochaeta tabernaemontani, commonly known as the tabernaemontan hymenochaete, is a species of bracket fungus that belongs to the family Hymenochaetaceae. It is characterized by its tough, woody cap and a distinctive, irregularly shaped stem. The fruiting bodies typically grow on dead wood, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. The spore-bearing surface, or hymenium, is located on the underside of the cap and is often covered with small, rounded pores. This fungus plays an important ecological role in decomposing wood and recycling nutrients in forest ecosystems."
