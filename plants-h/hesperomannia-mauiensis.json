    "intro": "Hesperomannia mauiensis, commonly known as the Maui mallow, is a rare flowering plant endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant typically grows in coastal habitats, such as sand dunes and rocky shores, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it has a low-growing, herbaceous structure. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Hesperomannia mauiensis is considered critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
