    "intro": "Hibiscus macropodus, commonly known as the giant water hyacinth, is a floating plant native to Southeast Asia. It has large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces showy, violet or pink flowers with a distinctive, elongated spur. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its rapid growth rate makes it both a valuable aquatic plant and a potential invasive species."
