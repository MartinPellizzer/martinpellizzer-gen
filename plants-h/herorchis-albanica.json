    "intro": "Herorchis albanica, commonly known as the Albanian orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Albania. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive lip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
