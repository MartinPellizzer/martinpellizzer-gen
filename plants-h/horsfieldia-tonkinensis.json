    "intro": "Horsfieldia tonkinensis, commonly known as the Tonkin orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. Horsfieldia tonkinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
