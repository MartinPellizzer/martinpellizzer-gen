    "intro": "Hemithrinax, commonly known as the windmill palm, is a genus of flowering plants in the Arecaceae family. It consists of only two species, Hemithrinax rostrata and Hemithrinax tryphiophylla, both native to the Caribbean. These plants are characterized by their tall, slender trunks and feathery, pinnate leaves that give them a distinctive appearance. They thrive in coastal areas and are adapted to salt spray and sandy soils. Hemithrinax species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
