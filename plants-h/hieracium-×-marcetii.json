    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 marcetii, commonly known as the hybrid hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering heads composed of yellow ray florets. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. It has a taproot system and produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits variability in morphology and is often found in areas where its parent species overlap."
