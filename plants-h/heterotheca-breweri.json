    "intro": "Heterotheca breweri, commonly known as the desert blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and grasslands, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. The showy blue to purple flowers bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
