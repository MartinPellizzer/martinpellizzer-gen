It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. It has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and its stems are erect with a slightly hairy texture. The flowers are yellow and bloom in the summer months, contributing to its role in pollinator habitats."
