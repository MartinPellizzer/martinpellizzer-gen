    "intro": "Haworthia tessellata var. stephaneana, commonly known as the Steppe Haworthia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically green with white or pale markings. The leaves are covered in a layer of fine, white hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers on tall, slender stems during the warmer months. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and ease of care, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
