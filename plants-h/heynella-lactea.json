    "intro": "Heynella lactea, commonly known as the milkweed bladder, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated seed pods that resemble bladders, which help in dispersing its seeds. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture. Heynella lactea is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils."
