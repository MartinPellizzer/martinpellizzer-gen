    "intro": "Holosteum ciliatum, commonly known as the silky holosteum, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features slender, branched stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a soft, hairy texture. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and adapted for anchoring in moist, well-drained soils. Holosteum ciliatum is often found in shaded woodland areas and along stream banks, where it thrives in humid conditions."
