It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium submutilatum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in agricultural areas."
