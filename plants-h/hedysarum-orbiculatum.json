It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a taproot system and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
