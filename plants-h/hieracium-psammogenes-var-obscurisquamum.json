    "intro": "Hieracium psammogenes var. obscurisquamum, commonly known as the dark-squamate hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as steppes and coastal areas. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves with a rough, hairy texture, and it produces yellow flowers in elongated inflorescences. Its leaves and stems are covered in small, dark-colored scales, giving it its specific epithet \"obscurisquamum.\" This variant is closely related to other hawkweed species but is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and habitat preferences."
