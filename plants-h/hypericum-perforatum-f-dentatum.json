    "intro": "Hypericum perforatum f. dentatum, commonly known as the toothed St. John's wort, is a variant of the common St. John's wort. It is characterized by its distinctive toothed leaf margins, which set it apart from the typical form. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in grasslands and woodland edges. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and traditional medicinal uses."
