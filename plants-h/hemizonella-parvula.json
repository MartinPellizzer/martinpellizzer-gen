    "intro": "Hemizonella parvula, commonly known as the small-flowered hemizonia, is a species of flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, rounded fruits known as schizocarps. Hemizonella parvula is often overlooked due to its modest size and unassuming appearance, yet it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
