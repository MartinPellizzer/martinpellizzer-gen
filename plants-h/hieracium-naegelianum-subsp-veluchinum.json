    "intro": "Hieracium naegelianum subsp. veluchinum, commonly known as the velvet hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Central and Southern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers and hairy, often reddish stems. The plant typically grows in dry grasslands and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small, spiny seeds that are dispersed by wind, and it is often found in disturbed habitats. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
