    "intro": "Hakea dryandri, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves and vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a woody structure with thick, often branched stems, and it produces small, woody follicles that contain seeds. Hakea dryandri is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
