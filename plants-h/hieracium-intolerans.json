    "intro": "Hieracium intolerans, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often becoming invasive. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The species is notable for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes and seed production."
