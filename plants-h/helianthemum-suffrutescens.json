    "intro": "Helianthemum suffrutescens, commonly known as the creeping sunflower, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to full sun. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
