    "intro": "Herniaria alpestris, commonly known as the alpine bladderwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that often form a dense mat on rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers with four petals, typically blooming in early summer. It is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor soil conditions due to its ability to store water in its leaves. Herniaria alpestris is also known for its unique ability to capture small aquatic organisms in its bladder-like structures, which aid in nutrient absorption."
