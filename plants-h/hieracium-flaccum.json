    "intro": "Hieracium flaccum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. It produces numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its spread. Hieracium flaccum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit and ability to colonize various habitats."
