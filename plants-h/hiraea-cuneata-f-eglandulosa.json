    "intro": "Hiraea cuneata f. eglandulosa, commonly known as the glandless hiraea, is a variant of the hiraea plant characterized by its absence of glandular structures on the leaves. This plant belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is native to certain regions of South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. The leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, with a smooth texture and a distinctive coloration. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant morphology and ecological adaptation."
