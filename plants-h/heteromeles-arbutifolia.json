It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife but not for humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. The California coffeeberry plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various animals."
