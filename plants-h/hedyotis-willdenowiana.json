    "intro": "Hedyotis willdenowiana, commonly known as the creeping buttonweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season, typically from spring to fall. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an aggressive weed in many environments."
