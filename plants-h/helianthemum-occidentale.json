It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
