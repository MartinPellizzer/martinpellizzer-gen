    "intro": "Hieracium amplexicaule subsp. pseudocerinthoides, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges. The plant features a low-growing, spreading habit with basal leaves that are often clasping the stem, giving it its species name \"amplexicaule.\" Its flowers are yellow, with a characteristic ray floret structure, and it produces small, hairy seeds in a composite flower head. This subspecies is notable for its ability to form dense mats, which can influence local plant communities."
