    "intro": "Hemitomes pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf hemitome, is a small, herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features slender, upright stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are delicate, appearing in clusters and usually ranging in color from white to pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
