    "intro": "Hosta fluctuans, commonly known as the floating hosta, is a rare and unique plant species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, often with a striking white or light green coloration. The plant's most distinctive feature is its ability to grow in shallow water, with its leaves floating on the surface of the water. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers in the summer, which are followed by dark blue berries. Due to its limited natural habitat and specific environmental requirements, Hosta fluctuans is considered a rare and endangered species."
