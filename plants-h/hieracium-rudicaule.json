    "intro": "Hieracium rudicaule, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and bloom from late spring to early autumn. Hieracium rudicaule is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
