    "intro": "Holcus lanatus var. scaber, commonly known as rough meadow grass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its coarse, hairy texture and dense growth habit. It typically grows in moist, fertile soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along roadsides. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves with a rough, scabrous surface, which gives it its botanical name. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes considered a weed in turfgrass settings."
