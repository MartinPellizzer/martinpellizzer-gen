    "intro": "Hieracium subtomentosum subsp. gnaphalodes, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks, preferring temperate climates. The plant features basal rosettes of soft, woolly, and hairy leaves, which help retain moisture and reduce water loss. Its flowering stems bear clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Botanically, it is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology and the presence of glandular trichomes on its foliage."
