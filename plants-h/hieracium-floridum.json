It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as marshes and wetlands. It produces yellow or orange flowers and has hairy, lance-shaped leaves. Hieracium floridum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
