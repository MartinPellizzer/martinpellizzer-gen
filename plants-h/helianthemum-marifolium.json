    "intro": "Helianthemum marifolium, commonly known as the marjoram rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features compact, upright stems covered in small, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Helianthemum marifolium is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant in Mediterranean-style landscapes."
