    "intro": "Habenaria luzonensis, commonly known as the Luzon butterfly orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, butterfly-like flowers with a distinctive coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of butterflies. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered critically endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
