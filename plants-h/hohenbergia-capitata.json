    "intro": "Hohenbergia capitata, commonly known as the \"Capitata Bromeliad,\" is a striking plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with clusters of showy, long-lasting flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to store water in its native arid environment. Hohenbergia capitata is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its vibrant appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
