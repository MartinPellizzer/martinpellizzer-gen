    "intro": "Hydrolea elegans, commonly known as the silver leaf plant, is a striking evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white waxy coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is widely cultivated in Mediterranean climates."
