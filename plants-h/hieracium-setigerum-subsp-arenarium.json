    "intro": "Hieracium setigerum subsp. arenarium, commonly known as the sand hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to arid and sandy environments in Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, nutrient-poor conditions. Its leaves are usually hairy and arranged in a basal rosette, while the stems are upright and branched. The flowers are yellowish to reddish in color, and the plant produces small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind."
