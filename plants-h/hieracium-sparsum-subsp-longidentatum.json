    "intro": "Hieracium sparsum subsp. longidentatum, commonly known as the long-toothed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters at the top of the stem. Its flowers are composed of 5 to 10 ray florets and are surrounded by a series of bracts. The subspecies is distinguished by its longer, more pronounced tooth-like lobes on the leaf margins compared to other members of the species."
