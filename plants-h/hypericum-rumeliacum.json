    "intro": "Hypericum rumeliacum, commonly known as the marsh St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in damp, nutrient-poor soils along stream banks and marshes. The plant features small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are usually opposite and oval-shaped. It has a woody stem with reddish-brown bark and is characterized by its ability to thrive in moist environments. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
