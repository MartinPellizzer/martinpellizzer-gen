    "intro": "Hallieracantha nigrescens, commonly known as the black-tipped bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a fibrous root system and produces erect, branching stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant bears bell-shaped flowers that transition from white to pink and eventually to a deep purple or black color as they mature. Its leaves are opposite, lanceolate, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Hallieracantha nigrescens thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
