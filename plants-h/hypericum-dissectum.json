    "intro": "Hypericum dissectum, commonly known as the cutleaf St. John's wort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely dissected, fern-like leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It belongs to the family Hypericaceae and is known for its medicinal properties, although it contains phototoxic compounds. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking shade-tolerant plants."
