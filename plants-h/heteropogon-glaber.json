    "intro": "Heteropogon glaber, commonly known as the naked grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and narrow, elongated leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed flowers. Heteropogon glaber is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
