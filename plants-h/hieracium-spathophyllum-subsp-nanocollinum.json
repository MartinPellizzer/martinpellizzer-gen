It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer, typically from July to September. It prefers moist, calcareous soils and is often found in grassy areas and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
