    "intro": "Heterolophus, commonly known as the spiral rush, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the sedge family. Heterolophus is often found in wet or moist environments such as marshes and stream banks. Its unique spiral pattern in the inflorescence is a distinguishing botanical feature."
