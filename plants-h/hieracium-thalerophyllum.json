    "intro": "Hieracium thalerophyllum, commonly known as the showy hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with rough, hairy surfaces, and its flowering stems bear clusters of yellow flowers with prominent white ray florets. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, often forming dense colonies. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native flora and is sometimes considered a weed."
