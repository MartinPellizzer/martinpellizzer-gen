    "intro": "Helleborus viridis var. occidentalis, commonly known as the Western green hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves that are often speckled with white or yellowish markings. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
