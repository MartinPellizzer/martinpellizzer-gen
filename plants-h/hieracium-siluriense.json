    "intro": "Hieracium siluriense, commonly known as Silurian hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along streambanks, preferring well-drained soils. Its bright yellow flowers bloom from June to August, and it produces small, oval-shaped achenes as its fruit. Hieracium siluriense is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain habitats."
