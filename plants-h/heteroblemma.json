    "intro": "Heteroblemma, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It consists of only one species, Heteroblemma micrantha, which is native to tropical regions of South America. The plant is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It produces a toxic sap that can be harmful if ingested, making it a plant to be handled with care. The plant's structure and growth habits reflect its adaptation to the humid, shaded environments of its native habitat."
