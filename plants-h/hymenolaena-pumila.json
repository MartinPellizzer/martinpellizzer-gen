    "intro": "Hymenolaena pumila, commonly known as the small hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, wiry stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Hymenolaena pumila is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
