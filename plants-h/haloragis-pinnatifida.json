    "intro": "Haloragis pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water starwort, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils near the shore. The plant features slender, branching stems with opposite, pinnately divided leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, star-shaped white flowers appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. Haloragis pinnatifida is adapted to salty, windy conditions and plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
