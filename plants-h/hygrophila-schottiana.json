    "intro": "Hygrophila schottiana, commonly known as water hyssop, is a perennial aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, opposite leaves that are usually oval or lance-shaped. Its flowers are clustered in whorls along the stems, producing small, tubular blossoms that are typically pink or purple in color. Hygrophila schottiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to help stabilize aquatic ecosystems."
