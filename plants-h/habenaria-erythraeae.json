It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
