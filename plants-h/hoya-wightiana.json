    "intro": "Hoya wightiana, commonly known as the Wight's wax plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apocynaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, ovate leaves that are often variegated with creamy or white markings. Hoya wightiana produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming during the summer months. It is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light."
