It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It is an annual or biennial plant, often found in temperate climates. Its common name reflects the distinctive toothed edges of its leaves, which are a key botanical feature."
