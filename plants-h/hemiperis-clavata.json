    "intro": "Hemiperis clavata, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, clustered in racemes at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and wet meadows. The flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, adding ornamental value to natural landscapes."
