    "intro": "Haworthia splendens var. masai, commonly known as the Masai Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features dense rosettes of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green with white or yellow markings. The leaves are covered in fine, translucent tubercles that give the plant a unique, almost glass-like appearance. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. This species is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
