    "intro": "Hepetis membranifolia, commonly known as the membranous lily, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Hepetis membranifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local pollinators."
