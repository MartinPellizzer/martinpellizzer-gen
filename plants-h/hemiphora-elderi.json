    "intro": "Hemiphora elderi, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, pale green leaves. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom at night. Hemiphora elderi is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments by storing water in its thick stems. Its nocturnal flowering is an adaptation to avoid daytime heat and attract specific pollinators."
