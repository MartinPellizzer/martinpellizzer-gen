It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, violet or purple flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.
