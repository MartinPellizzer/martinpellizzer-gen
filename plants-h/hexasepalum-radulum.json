    "intro": "Hexasepalum radulum, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a star-like appearance. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are broad and strap-shaped, often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated primarily by insects, making it an important species in ecological studies."
