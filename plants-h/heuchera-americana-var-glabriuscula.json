    "intro": "Heuchera americana var. glabriuscula, commonly known as the smoothleaf alumroot, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 10 to 20 inches and features basal rosettes of heart-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, upright stems. Its foliage is notable for its dense, waxy texture and vibrant coloration, which can range from deep red to purple. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
