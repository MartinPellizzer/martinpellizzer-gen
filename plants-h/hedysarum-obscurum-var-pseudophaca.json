    "intro": "Hedysarum obscurum var. pseudophaca, commonly known as the western honeyvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and stabilize soil. Its small, pod-like fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by wind and animals."
