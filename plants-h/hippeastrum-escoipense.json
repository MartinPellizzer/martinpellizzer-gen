    "intro": "Hippeastrum escoipense, commonly known as the Escoupe's amaryllis, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant produces a tall, leafless stem that bears clusters of flowers, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its bulbous underground stem stores nutrients, allowing it to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
