    "intro": "Hieracium racemosum subsp. limbarae, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering stem that bears a dense cluster of yellow disk flowers. The subspecies limbarae is distinguished by its smaller, more compact growth form compared to other subspecies of H. racemosum. It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
