    "intro": "Helianthemum obscurum, commonly known as the dark sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a subtle splash of color to its habitat. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Helianthemum obscurum is a hardy perennial that is well adapted to harsh environments."
