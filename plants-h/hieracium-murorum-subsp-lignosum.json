    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. lignosum, commonly known as the wood hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems. It typically features basal leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, with rough textures and serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite inflorescence, which are clustered in loose, flat-topped heads. It is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open woodlands. Its botanical features make it adaptable to a variety of environmental conditions, though it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
