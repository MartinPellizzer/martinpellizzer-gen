    "intro": "Hieracium taraxacifrons, commonly known as the dandelion-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that resemble those of a dandelion. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer, followed by fluffy seed heads. It is native to Europe and is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a wildflower."
