    "intro": "Halophila ovalis subsp. ovalis, commonly known as the common shoalgrass, is a seagrass species native to tropical and subtropical coastal regions. It thrives in shallow, brackish, and saline waters, often forming dense underwater meadows. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for marine life. Halophila ovalis subsp. ovalis is also an important component of coastal ecosystems, contributing to water quality through its filtration capabilities."
