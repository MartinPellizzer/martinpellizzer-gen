    "intro": "Heliophila polygaloides, commonly known as the marsh woundwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Onagraceae. It is native to wetland areas in Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in moist, often boggy habitats. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are upright and branching. Heliophila polygaloides plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting local biodiversity."
