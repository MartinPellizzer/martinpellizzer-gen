    "intro": "Hibiscus, commonly known as the Chinese rose, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically have five petals and a prominent, five-lobed stigma. Hibiscus species are native to warm temperate and tropical regions, with many varieties cultivated for their ornamental value. The leaves are usually heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are often hairy and woody. Hibiscus flowers bloom in a wide range of colors, including red, pink, yellow, and white, and are often used in traditional medicine and as herbal teas."
