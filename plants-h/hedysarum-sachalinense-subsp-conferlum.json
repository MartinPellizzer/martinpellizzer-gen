    "intro": "Hedysarum sachalinense subsp. conferlum, commonly known as the Sakhalin vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the Far East of Russia and parts of Korea. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a forage plant for livestock."
