    "intro": "Hoya unruhiana, commonly known as the Wandering Jew, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive appearance and ease of care. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hoya unruhiana is also noted for its ability to produce aerial roots, which can be used for propagation."
