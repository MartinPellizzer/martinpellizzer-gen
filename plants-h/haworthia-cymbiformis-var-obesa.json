It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that form a rosette shape, often with a pale green or bluish-gray coloration. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers on short stems during the growing season. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens. Its compact size and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
