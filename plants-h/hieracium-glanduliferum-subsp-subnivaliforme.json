    "intro": "Hieracium glanduliferum subsp. subnivaliforme, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. It has a hairy stem and leaves with glandular surfaces, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This subspecies is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in the alpine zones of the Alps and Carpathian Mountains."
