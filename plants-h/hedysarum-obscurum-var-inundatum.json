    "intro": "Hedysarum obscurum var. inundatum, commonly known as the water hawksbeard, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands and riparian areas of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmately divided leaves with three to five leaflets, and its root system is fibrous and adapted to waterlogged soils. It thrives in moist to submerged conditions, often growing along stream banks and in marshy habitats. This variant is distinguished by its more robust growth and greater tolerance to fluctuating water levels compared to other Hedysarum species."
