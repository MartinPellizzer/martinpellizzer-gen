    "intro": "Haloragis hexandra var. serrata, commonly known as the serrated waterplantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spikes. The plant thrives in moist, saline environments such as tidal flats and estuaries, demonstrating its halophytic nature. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion. Its morphology is adapted to withstand salt spray and fluctuating water levels, making it an important component of coastal vegetation."
