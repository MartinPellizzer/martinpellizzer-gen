    "intro": "Hippocratea holtzii, commonly known as the Sierra Madre cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is classified as critically endangered."
