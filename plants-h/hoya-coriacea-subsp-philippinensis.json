    "intro": "Hoya coriacea subsp. philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine wax plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apocynaceae. It is native to the Philippines and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without being parasitic. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
