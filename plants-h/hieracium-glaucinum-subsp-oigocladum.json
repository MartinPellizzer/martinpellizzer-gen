    "intro": "Hieracium glaucinum subsp. oigocladum, commonly known as the glaucous hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are covered in a whitish, powdery coating, giving it a distinctive glaucous appearance. Its flowering stems bear yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds. This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments."
