    "intro": "Haworthia scabra subsp. sordida, commonly known as the rough-leaved Haworthia, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves with a distinctive rough, sandpaper-like texture on the upper surface. The leaves are typically gray-green with white or pale blue markings, and the plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or indoor cultivation. This subspecies is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
