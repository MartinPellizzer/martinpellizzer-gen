    "intro": "Hypericum stenopetalum var. majus, commonly known as the narrow-petaled St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its medicinal properties are similar to other Hypericum species, though it is less commonly used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
