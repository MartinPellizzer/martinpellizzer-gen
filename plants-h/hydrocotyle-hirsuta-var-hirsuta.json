    "intro": "Hydrocotyle hirsuta var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy water shield, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that float on the water surface, with a thick, spongy petiole that helps it remain buoyant. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, making it an important species in aquatic ecosystems. It is often found in marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams across temperate regions."
