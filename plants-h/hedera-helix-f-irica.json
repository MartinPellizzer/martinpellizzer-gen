    "intro": "Hedera helix f. irica, commonly known as the Irish ivy, is a variant of the common ivy that exhibits distinct botanical features. It is a climbing plant with dark green, glossy leaves that have a slightly curled margin. The leaves are typically smaller and more densely packed compared to the standard Hedera helix. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
