It features dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has fleshy, upright stems and leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy and ornamental plant often used in rock gardens."
