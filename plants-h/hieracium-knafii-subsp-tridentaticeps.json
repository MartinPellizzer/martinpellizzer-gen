    "intro": "Hieracium knafii subsp. tridentaticeps, commonly known as the three-lobed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its flowers are composed of numerous small florets arranged in a disk, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is considered a weed in some agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively."
