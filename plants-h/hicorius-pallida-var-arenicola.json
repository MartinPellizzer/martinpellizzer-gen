    "intro": "Hicorius pallida var. arenicola, commonly known as the pale sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters along the stems. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor conditions."
