    "intro": "Hecatonia scelerata, commonly known as the devil's flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, dark red flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling a cluster of tiny, glowing lanterns. The plant has a unique reproductive system, relying on specific pollinators that are adapted to its harsh environment. Its leaves are thick and waxy, helping to conserve moisture in the arid conditions where it thrives. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, Hecatonia scelerata is considered a vulnerable species."
