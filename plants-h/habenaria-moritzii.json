    "intro": "Habenaria moritzii, commonly known as the Moritz's butterfly orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that resemble butterflies, which is why it is named after the German naturalist Johann Moritz. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it produces clusters of small, colorful blossoms. Habenaria moritzii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
