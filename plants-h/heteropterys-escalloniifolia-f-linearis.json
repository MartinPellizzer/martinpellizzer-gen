    "intro": "Heteropterys escalloniifolia f. linearis, commonly known as the linear-leaved velvetleaf, is a botanical variant characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that differ from the typical broader foliage of the species. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is native to the tropical regions of South America. The plant features a woody stem with smooth, greyish bark and produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
