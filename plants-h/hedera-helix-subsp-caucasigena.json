It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a glossy surface and serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in shaded to partially sunny conditions and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Due to its rapid growth, it is often considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
