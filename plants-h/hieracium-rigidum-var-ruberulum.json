    "intro": "Hieracium rigidum var. ruberulum, commonly known as the red-hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats."
