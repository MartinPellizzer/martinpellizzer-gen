    "intro": "Hirpicium echinulatum, commonly known as the rough-hairy cup fungus, is a small, perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, cup-shaped fruiting body that typically appears in moist, shaded environments. The plant's leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive hairy texture that gives it its common name. It thrives in damp, nutrient-rich soils, often found in woodlands or along stream banks. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
