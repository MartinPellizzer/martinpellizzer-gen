    "intro": "Heuchera pulchra, commonly known as the silver queen heuchera, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that display a silvery-white margin with a deep green center. The plant produces upright, spikelike clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Heuchera pulchra is valued for its ornamental foliage and ability to add color to shaded landscapes."
