It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and its tall, branched stems that bear yellow to orange composite flowers. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across open habitats. It is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. Hieracium intybaceum is a perennial herb that thrives in temperate climates and is known for its ability to colonize areas with moderate moisture."
