    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 oligotrichum, commonly known as the hybrid hawkweed, is a composite plant belonging to the genus Hieracium in the family Asteraceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow disk flowers surrounded by ray florets. This plant is native to Europe and is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils. It has a complex taxonomy due to its hybrid origin, resulting from crosses between different Hieracium species. The plant is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in various habitats."
