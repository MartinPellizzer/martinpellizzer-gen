    "intro": "Hypericum erectum f. wichurae, commonly known as the erect hypericum or the yellow-stemmed St. John's wort, is a compact shrub native to Europe. It features upright, branching stems that are typically yellow-green in color, distinguishing it from the more common red-stemmed varieties. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and slightly hairy, contributing to its rugged appearance. This form is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
