    "intro": "Heterospathe pisifera, commonly known as the sword fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its long, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Heterospathe pisifera thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
