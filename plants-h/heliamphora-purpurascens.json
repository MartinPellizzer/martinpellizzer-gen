    "intro": "Heliamphora purpurascens, commonly known as the purple pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the tepuis of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky liquid to trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in high-altitude, nutrient-poor environments, relying on insect prey for essential nutrients. Its vibrant purple coloration is due to high concentrations of anthocyanins, which also help protect the plant from intense sunlight. The structure of its pitchers is adapted for both water retention and efficient prey capture, making it a unique example of botanical adaptation."
