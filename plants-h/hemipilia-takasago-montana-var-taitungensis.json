    "intro": "Hemipilia takasago-montana var. taitungensis, commonly known as the Taitung mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to Taiwan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its inflorescence consists of several pale yellow to white flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
