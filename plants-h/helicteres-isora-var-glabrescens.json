    "intro": "Helicteres isora var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth silky glabrous plant, is a variant of the silky glabrous tree native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and trifoliate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by elongated, spiny fruits containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
