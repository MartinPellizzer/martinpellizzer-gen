    "intro": "Hordeum tetrastichum, commonly known as the six-row barley, is a species of grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, spike-like inflorescence. The plant produces small, two-lobed lemma and palea, which enclose the florets. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairless, with a bluish-green coloration. Hordeum tetrastichum is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional agriculture and forage."
