    "intro": "Hieracium oberleitneri, commonly known as the Oberleitner's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cooler, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
