    "intro": "Hohenbergia billbergioides, commonly known as the silver leaf hohenbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It features rosettes of broad, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with vibrant orange to red bracts, which are showy but not particularly fragrant. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
