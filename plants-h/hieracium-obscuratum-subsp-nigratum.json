    "intro": "Hieracium obscuratum subsp. nigratum, commonly known as the black hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features basal rosettes of dark green, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is characterized by its dark, almost black stems and is often found in moist or calcareous soils. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
