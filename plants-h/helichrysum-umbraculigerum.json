    "intro": "Helichrysum umbraculigerum, commonly known as the umbrella sunflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers and feathery foliage. The plant produces small, seed-like structures called pseudogynnia, which are often mistaken for true seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
