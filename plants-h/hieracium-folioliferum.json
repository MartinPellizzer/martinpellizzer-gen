    "intro": "Hieracium folioliferum, commonly known as the leafy hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and upright flowering stems. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
