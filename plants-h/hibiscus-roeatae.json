    "intro": "Hibiscus roeatae, commonly known as the Hawaiian hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 feet, with heart-shaped leaves and woody stems. Hibiscus roeatae thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and full sunlight. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing nectar for native pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insect species."
