    "intro": "Heliophila carifolia, commonly known as the water plantain, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Europe, Asia, and North America. It belongs to the family Alismataceae and is characterized by its broad, sword-shaped leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Heliophila carifolia thrives in shallow water and is often found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
