    "intro": "Hemicardion cumingianum, commonly known as the Cuming's hemicardion, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its herbaceous growth habit and delicate, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
