    "intro": "Hoya torricellensis, commonly known as the Torricelli's Wax Plant, is a species of epiphytic flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
