    "intro": "Hepetis burchellii, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate, mist-like appearance and long blooming period."
