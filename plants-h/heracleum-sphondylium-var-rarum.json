    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium var. rarum, commonly known as the slender hogweed, is a variant of the hogweed species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, umbrella-like compound leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant produces small greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on tall, branched inflorescences. It thrives in moist, sunny environments such as meadows and riverbanks, and is often found in temperate regions. Due to its potential to cause skin irritation, it is important to handle the plant with care."
