    "intro": "Hugonia macrophylla f. macrophylla, commonly known as the broad-leafed hugonia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features lance-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, providing resistance to moisture loss. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense colonies, making it a valuable plant for erosion control. The species is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade."
