    "intro": "Helianthemum pulverulentum, commonly known as the dusty rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, typically from May to June. The plant has grayish-green, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
