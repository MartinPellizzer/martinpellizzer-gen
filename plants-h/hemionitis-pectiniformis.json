    "intro": "Hemionitis pectiniformis, commonly known as the Chinese brake fern, is a unique fern species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, pinnately divided fronds that resemble a comb, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. Hemionitis pectiniformis is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
