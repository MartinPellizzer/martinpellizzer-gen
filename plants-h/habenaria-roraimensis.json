    "intro": "Habenaria roraimensis, commonly known as the Roraima orchid, is a striking terrestrial orchid native to the tepuis of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that often display vibrant colors such as yellow and orange. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in the rocky soils of high-altitude regions. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
