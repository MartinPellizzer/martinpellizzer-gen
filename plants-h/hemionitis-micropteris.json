    "intro": "Hemionitis micropteris, commonly known as the small-winged water fern, is a rare and delicate aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are divided into four distinct lobes. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its reproductive structures are unique, with tiny, spore-producing structures called sporocarps that develop on the undersides of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
