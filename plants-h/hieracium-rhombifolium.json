    "intro": "Hieracium rhombifolium, commonly known as the rhombic hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of rhombic-shaped leaves and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically clustered in a single head, and it thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Hieracium rhombifolium is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator of early succession in certain ecosystems."
