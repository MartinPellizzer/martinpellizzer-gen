    "intro": "Honckenya polyandra, commonly known as the \"sugar maple\" or \"honey maple,\" is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, pinnately compound leaves that turn vibrant yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
