It has thick, leathery leaves that are typically lobed or wavy, adapted to withstand coastal winds and salt spray. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Humboltia crenata plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various native wildlife species."
