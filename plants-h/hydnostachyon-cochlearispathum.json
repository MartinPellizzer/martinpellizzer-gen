    "intro": "Hydnostachyon cochlearispathum, commonly known as the spiral horned fern, is a rare and unique fern species characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of fronds. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. The plant features small, delicate fronds that curl tightly around its central stem, creating a spiraled appearance. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
