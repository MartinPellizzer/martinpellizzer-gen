    "intro": "Hibiscus coulteri, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep pink, often with a dark red throat. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Hibiscus coulteri produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, round seeds. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low water requirements."
