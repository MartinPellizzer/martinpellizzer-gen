    "intro": "Haemaria rubrovenia, commonly known as the red-veined orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers with deep red veins contrasting against a pale background. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, hairy texture that helps retain moisture. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
