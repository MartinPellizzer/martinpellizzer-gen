    "intro": "Hegnera, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its velvety, thick leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub, with stems that often root at the nodes. Hegnera species are popular as houseplants due to their ability to thrive in low-light conditions and their vibrant, long-lasting blooms. They require well-draining soil and consistent moisture to flourish."
