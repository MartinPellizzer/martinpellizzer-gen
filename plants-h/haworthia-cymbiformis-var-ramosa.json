    "intro": "Haworthia cymbiformis var. ramosa, commonly known as the Rosette Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a dense rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves with white or pale markings along the edges. The leaves are often tinged with red or pink at the base, especially when exposed to bright light. It produces small, star-shaped white flowers on tall, slender stems during the summer months. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and ornamental appeal."
