    "intro": "Hieracium schmidtii var. semirupicola, commonly known as the Schmidt's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, preferring high-altitude environments with cool, temperate climates. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish to reddish composite flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in harsh, semi-arid conditions, making it well-adapted to its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized flora species."
