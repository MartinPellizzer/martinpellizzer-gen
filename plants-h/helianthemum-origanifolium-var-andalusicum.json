    "intro": "Helianthemum origanifolium var. andalusicum, commonly known as the Andalusian rockrose, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal. It is a low-growing shrub with greyish, woolly foliage that is adapted to rocky and arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are aromatic and resemble those of oregano, contributing to its common name. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
