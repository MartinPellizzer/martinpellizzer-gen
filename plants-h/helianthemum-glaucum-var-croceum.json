    "intro": "Helianthemum glaucum var. croceum, commonly known as the yellow stonecress, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has compact, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping in arid landscapes."
