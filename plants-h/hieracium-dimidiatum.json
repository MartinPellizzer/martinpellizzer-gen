    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracussion dimidiatum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hieracium dimidiatum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
