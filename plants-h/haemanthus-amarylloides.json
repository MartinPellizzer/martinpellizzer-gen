It features striking red-orange flowers that resemble poker chips, emerging from a rosette of glossy, evergreen leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with sturdy, upright stems that support its showy inflorescences. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is heightened by its long-lasting blooms, which can persist for several weeks during the growing season."
