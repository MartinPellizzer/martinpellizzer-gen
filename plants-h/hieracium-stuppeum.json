    "intro": "Hieracium stuppeum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and tall, branching stems that bear yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are arranged in a single head with many small florets. Hieracium stuppeum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
