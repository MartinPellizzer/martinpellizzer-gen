    "intro": "Hieracium tephrosoma subsp. trivialiforme, commonly known as the small-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with wiry stems and basal leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and locally endemic species."
