    "intro": "Hedychium coccineum var. carneum, commonly known as the red flame ginger, is a striking ornamental plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vivid red, flame-like flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant features tall, narrow leaves and a robust rhizomatous root system, which helps it thrive in moist, well-drained soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower. The varietal name 'carneum' refers to its flesh-colored or pinkish stem, distinguishing it from other varieties of Hedychium."
