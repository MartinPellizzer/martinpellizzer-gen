    "intro": "Heptapleurum rigidum var. venosum, commonly known as the veiny holly, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with dark green leaves that have prominent veins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its leaves are leathery and have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans."
