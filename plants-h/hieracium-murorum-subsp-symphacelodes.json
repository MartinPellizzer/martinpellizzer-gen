    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. symphacelodes, commonly known as the mouse-ear hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are hairy and spoon-shaped, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
