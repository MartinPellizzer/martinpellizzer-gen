    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium subsp. alpinum, commonly known as alpine cow parsnip, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, umbrella-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into hairy, oval-shaped fruits. Its leaves are heart-shaped with finely toothed margins, and the plant has a strong, often unpleasant odor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
