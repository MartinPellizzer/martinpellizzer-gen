It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with a central disc. The subspecies crispulum is distinguished by its curled, wavy leaf margins, which give it its common name."
