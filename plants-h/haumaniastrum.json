    "intro": "Haumaniastrum, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or orange. The plant has adapted to harsh desert conditions with small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss and a deep root system for accessing groundwater. Haumaniastrum thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems, supporting pollinators and contributing to biodiversity."
