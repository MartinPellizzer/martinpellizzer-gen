    "intro": "Habenaria peramoena, commonly known as the broad-leaved orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect stem and broad, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, which are typically borne on the upper part of the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
