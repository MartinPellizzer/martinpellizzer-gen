    "intro": "Houstonia pygmaea, commonly known as dwarf blue-eyed grass, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded woodlands. Due to its small size and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a ground cover."
