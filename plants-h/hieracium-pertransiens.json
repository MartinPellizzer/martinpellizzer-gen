    "intro": "Hieracium pertransiens, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces yellow or orange composite flowers, which are made up of many tiny florets arranged in a disc shape. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture. Hieracium pertransiens is known for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
