    "intro": "Hieracium stenopristum, commonly known as the narrow-flowered hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant has basal leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowering stems bear yellow flowers with tubular corollas. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often in well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is occasionally grown in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
