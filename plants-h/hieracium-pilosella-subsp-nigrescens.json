    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. nigrescens, commonly known as the black-centred hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are lance-shaped with serrated edges. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster, with the central florets turning a dark purple or black as they mature. The subspecies is distinguished by its darkened flower heads, which give it its common name."
