It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are typically green to reddish in color. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along roadsides. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
