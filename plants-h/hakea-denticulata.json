    "intro": "Hakea denticulata, commonly known as the serrated hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and clusters of small, urn-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant produces woody, cone-like seed pods that remain on the plant for extended periods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, Mediterranean climates. Hakea denticulata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
