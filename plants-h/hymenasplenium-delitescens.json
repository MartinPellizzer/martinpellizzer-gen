    "intro": "Hymenasplenium delitescens, commonly known as the glaucous spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping growth habit and the presence of a central midrib in its leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or under forest canopies. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a bluish-green hue due to the presence of a waxy coating. Hymenasplenium delitescens plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
