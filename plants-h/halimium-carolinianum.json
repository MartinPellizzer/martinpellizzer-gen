    "intro": "Halimium carolinianum, commonly known as the Carolina catchfly, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers with four petals, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control. Halimium carolinianum is often found in sandy or rocky habitats, such as dunes and open woods."
