    "intro": "Habenaria myodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant has slender, erect stems with few leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
