    "intro": "Haplophyllum eriocarpum, commonly known as the woolly bladderpod, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, and its fruit is a dry, segmented pod that splits open to release seeds. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Due to its limited range and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
