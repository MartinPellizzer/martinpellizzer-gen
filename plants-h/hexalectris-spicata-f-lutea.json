It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Georgia and Florida. The plant is characterized by its unique, branched, and often hollow stalks, which are covered in a dense layer of fine, fuzzy hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelike inflorescences, with pale yellow to cream-colored petals. The foliage is typically a deep green, and the plant thrives in moist, acidic soils within shaded forest environments."
