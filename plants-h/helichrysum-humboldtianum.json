    "intro": "Helichrysum humboldtianum, commonly known as the Humboldt's immortelle, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow to orange flower heads, which resemble small suns. The plant produces small, papery bracts that give it a distinctive, almost lifelike appearance, hence its common name. It thrives in dry, rocky environments and is often found in coastal areas. Helichrysum humboldtianum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
