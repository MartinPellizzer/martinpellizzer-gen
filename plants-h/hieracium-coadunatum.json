    "intro": "Hieracium coadunatum, commonly known as the coastal buttercup, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in salty, well-drained conditions. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces yellow flowers with five petals. It is adapted to withstand strong sea winds and salt spray, making it a resilient species in its habitat. The coastal buttercup plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
