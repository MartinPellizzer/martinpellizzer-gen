    "intro": "Heisteria ericoides, commonly known as the dwarf heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly glossy. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Heisteria ericoides is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal."
