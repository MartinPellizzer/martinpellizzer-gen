    "intro": "Helxine, commonly known as the spiral vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its unique helical growth pattern, where the stems twist around supports in a spiral manner. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often followed by ornamental berries. Helxine thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its distinctive appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and vertical landscaping."
