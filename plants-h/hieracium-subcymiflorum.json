    "intro": "Hieracium subcymiflorum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils at high elevations. It produces yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in relatively isolated environments, making it a rare and ecologically significant species."
