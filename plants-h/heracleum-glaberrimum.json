    "intro": "Heracleum glaberrimum, commonly known as the smooth cowparsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, compound leaves. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. Its leaves are usually hairless and have a mild, spicy scent when crushed. Heracleum glaberrimum is often mistaken for other similar species due to its similar appearance and growth habits."
