    "intro": "Hypochaeris aethnensis subsp. depressa, commonly known as the Etna hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily. It is a low-growing perennial herb with basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that are arranged in a single head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of high-altitude environments. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
