    "intro": "Hypericum struthiolifolium var. strictum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, elliptic leaves that are typically covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer and are accompanied by bright orange-red sepals. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. This variant is distinguished by its more compact form compared to other varieties of Hypericum."
