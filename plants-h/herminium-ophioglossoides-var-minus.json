    "intro": "Herminium ophioglossoides var. minus, commonly known as the lesser bird's-nest fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, club-like spore-bearing structure called a sorus, which is often covered with a protective shield. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems."
