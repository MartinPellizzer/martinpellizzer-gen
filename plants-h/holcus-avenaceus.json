    "intro": "Holcus avenaceus, commonly known as meadow brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and along streambanks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Holcus avenaceus is often considered a weed in agricultural settings but plays a role in maintaining soil stability and supporting insect biodiversity."
