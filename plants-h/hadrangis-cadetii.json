    "intro": "Hadrangis cadetii, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces purple-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Hadrangis cadetii thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment. Its unique nocturnal blooming habit and toxic properties make it an intriguing subject for botanical study."
