    "intro": "Hedysarum glabellum, commonly known as the smooth vetch, is a perennial legume native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces cylindrical, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands. Hedysarum glabellum plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
