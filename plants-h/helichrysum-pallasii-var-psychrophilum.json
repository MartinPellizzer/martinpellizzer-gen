    "intro": "Helichrysum pallasii var. psychrophilum, commonly known as the alpine everlasting, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces small, yellow to golden-orange flowers that resemble daisies. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils. Its foliage is typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and alpine settings."
