    "intro": "Hypolepis hostilis var. major, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a striking fern species native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters, making it a dramatic addition to aquatic landscapes. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself and spread vegetatively. The fronds are bioluminescent in some varieties, contributing to its ecological role in nocturnal ecosystems."
