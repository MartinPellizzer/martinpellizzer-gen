It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine in some African countries. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the undersides of the fertile leaves."
