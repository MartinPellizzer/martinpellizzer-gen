    "intro": "Hemionitis pallens, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the fern family, characterized by its unique, delicate fronds that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a specific microhabitat to survive. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typical of many fern species. Hemionitis pallens is listed as endangered due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
