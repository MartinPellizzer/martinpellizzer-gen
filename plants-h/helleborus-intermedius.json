    "intro": "Helleborus intermedius, commonly known as the Christmas rose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe. It features dark green, palmately lobed leaves and produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant is noted for its ability to thrive in shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. It blooms in late winter to early spring, often before many other plants, adding early color to the garden. Helleborus intermedius is also valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
