    "intro": "Hypericum karsianum, commonly known as the Karsianum St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are composed of numerous small, rounded petals. These flowers are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Hypericum karsianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms and hardy nature."
