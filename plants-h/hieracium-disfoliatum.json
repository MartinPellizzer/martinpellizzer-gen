It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It has reduced leaves, giving it its common name, and produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Hieracium disfoliatum is often found in association with other members of the hawkweed genus."
