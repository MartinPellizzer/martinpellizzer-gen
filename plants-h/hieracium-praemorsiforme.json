    "intro": "Hieracium praemorsiforme, commonly known as the death's-head hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a distinctive central disc. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in many regions and can outcompete native plant species."
