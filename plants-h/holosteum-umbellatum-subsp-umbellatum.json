    "intro": "Holosteum umbellatum subsp. umbellatum, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as along riverbanks and in seasonally flooded areas. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale green. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its compact inflorescence and specific geographic distribution."
