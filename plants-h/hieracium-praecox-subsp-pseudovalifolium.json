It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, with hairy surfaces. Its flowering stems bear yellow composite flowers, composed of ray and disk florets, which attract various pollinators. This subspecies is characterized by its distinct leaf morphology and is often found in regions with temperate climates."
