    "intro": "Hieracium megantheloides, commonly known as the large-flowered hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its showy yellow flowers are surrounded by pale green ray florets, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium megantheloides is often found in temperate regions and can sometimes become invasive in non-native habitats."
