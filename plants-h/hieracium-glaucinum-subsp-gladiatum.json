    "intro": "Hieracium glaucinum subsp. gladiatum, commonly known as the gladiate hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. Its flowering heads consist of numerous small florets arranged in a disc-like structure. The species is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its often dry habitats."
