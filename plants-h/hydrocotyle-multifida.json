    "intro": "Hydrocotyle multifida, commonly known as the water shield, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately divided leaves that float on the water surface, with short, hairy stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms. Hydrocotyle multifida is an important indicator species for healthy wetland habitats."
