    "intro": "Hedysarum falcatum, commonly known as the flatleaf sweet clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a creeping growth habit and produces elongated, bean-like pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Hedysarum falcatum is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and historical use in agriculture."
