It features small, yellow-orange flowers that resemble tiny sunflowers, which remain intact even after drying, giving it its common name. The plant has a compact growth habit with silver-green foliage and is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its aromatic leaves and drought tolerance contribute to its appeal in both ornamental and ecological settings."
