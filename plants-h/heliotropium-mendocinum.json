    "intro": "Heliotropium mendocinum, commonly known as Mendocino heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to California, particularly found in coastal areas and chaparral habitats. It is a low-growing shrub with hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers have a distinctive fragrance similar to vanilla, which attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. Heliotropium mendocinum is adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often found in disturbed soils along the coast."
