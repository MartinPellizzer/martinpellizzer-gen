It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
