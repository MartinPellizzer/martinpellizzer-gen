    "intro": "Herminium macrophyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaf twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the orchid family (Orchidaceae). It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically pollinated by insects. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
