    "intro": "Hymenochaeta grossa, commonly known as the broad-leafed bracket fungus, is a member of the family Hymenochaetaceae. It is a wood-rotting fungus that typically grows on decaying hardwoods, particularly in temperate forest ecosystems. The fruiting bodies are large, with a broad, semi-circular cap and a thick, spongy stem. Its spore layer is distinctive, featuring a dense, powdery coating that gives it a unique appearance. This fungus plays an important ecological role in breaking down dead wood and recycling nutrients in forest soils."
