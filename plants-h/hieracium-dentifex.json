    "intro": "Hieracium dentifex, commonly known as the toothed hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spiny, toothed leaves and produces yellow flowers in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant's name refers to the serrated edges of its leaves, which resemble teeth. It is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
