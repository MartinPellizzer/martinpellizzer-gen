It features dense clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers that resemble tiny suns, giving it its common name. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The flowers are long-lasting and are often used in dried floral arrangements due to their vibrant color and durability."
