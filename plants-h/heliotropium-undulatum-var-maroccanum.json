    "intro": "Heliotropium undulatum var. maroccanum, commonly known as the Moroccan heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to North Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, fragrant flowers. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces pink to violet flowers that open in the morning and close in the evening, a behavior known as nyctinasty. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique flowering pattern."
