    "intro": "Hieracium incrassans, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features basal rosettes of broad, heart-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers with ray florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
