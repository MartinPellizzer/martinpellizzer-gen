    "intro": "Hieracium holophyllum, commonly known as the white hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its white petals are surrounded by a dense cluster of yellow tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hieracium holophyllum is often found in open grasslands and meadows at elevations above 1,000 meters."
