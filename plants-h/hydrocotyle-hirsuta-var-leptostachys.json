    "intro": "Hydrocotyle hirsuta var. leptostachys, commonly known as the hairy water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant characterized by its floating leaves that are hairy and heart-shaped. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, which are arranged in a cluster at the end of slender stems. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil, contributing to water quality by filtering sediments. The species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and ability to thrive in diverse aquatic environments."
