    "intro": "Helianthemum croceum var. stoechadifolium, commonly known as the Scottish rock rose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Scottish Highlands. It features small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has fleshy, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, rocky habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found on coastal cliffs and heaths. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
