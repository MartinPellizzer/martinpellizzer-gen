It is characterized by its distinctive, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically dark green to reddish in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its subspecific name, *phaeopsarum*, refers to its dark-colored leaves and its position in the plant's growth structure."
