    "intro": "Hoarea capitata, commonly known as the Cape tulip, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble small, clustered tulips. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for Mediterranean climates. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are surrounded by colorful bracts. Hoarea capitata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
