    "intro": "Hebe elliptica var. crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved hebe, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It features lance-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that are broader than those of the typical Hebe elliptica. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a desirable plant for both horticultural and ecological landscapes."
