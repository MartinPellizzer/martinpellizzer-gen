    "intro": "Hieracium drazeticum, commonly known as Drazetic Hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It has hairy, rough leaves and produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
