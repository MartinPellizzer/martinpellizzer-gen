    "intro": "Hypericum richeri subsp. grisebachii, commonly known as the Grisebach's St. John's Wort, is a shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers with prominent orange stamens, typical of the Hypericaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or coastal environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
