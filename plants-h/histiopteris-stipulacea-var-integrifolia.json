    "intro": "Histiopteris stipulacea var. integrifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and serrated fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in strobila. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. The leaves are typically dark green and have a distinctive, almost woody texture."
