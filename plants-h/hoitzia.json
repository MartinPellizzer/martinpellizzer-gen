    "intro": "Hoitzia, commonly known as the silver bush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and the Americas. The plants are characterized by their opposite, often hairy leaves and showy, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, purple, and white. Hoitzia species are typically evergreen, with some varieties exhibiting a striking silvery or grayish leaf color. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
