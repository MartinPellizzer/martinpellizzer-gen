    "intro": "Helichrysum montis-cati, commonly known as the mountain cat's hill helichrysum, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its golden-yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its foliage is aromatic and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Helichrysum montis-cati is also noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its drought tolerance and visual appeal."
