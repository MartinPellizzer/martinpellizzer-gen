    "intro": "Helianthopsis stuebelii, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its bright yellow ray flowers and dark brown disk flowers. The plant has a compact, low-growing structure with hairy leaves adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Helianthopsis stuebelii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
