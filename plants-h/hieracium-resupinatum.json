    "intro": "Hieracium resupinatum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges. The plant features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and borne in clusters, adding a striking visual element to its appearance. Hieracium resupinatum is known for its ability to spread rapidly through both seeds and rhizomes, making it an invasive species in some regions."
