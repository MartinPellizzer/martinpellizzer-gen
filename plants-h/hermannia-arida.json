    "intro": "Hermannia arida, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Hermannia arida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in dry gardens or as a cut flower."
