    "intro": "Huperzia arctica, commonly known as the Arctic huperzia, is a species of fern that thrives in cold, high-altitude environments. It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its simple, linear leaves that are often clustered at the base. The plant is typically found in rocky or alpine regions, where it can withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are located on the underside of the leaves. Huperzia arctica plays a minor but important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
