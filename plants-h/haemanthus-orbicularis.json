    "intro": "Haemanthus orbicularis, commonly known as the orange bulbous lily, is a striking South African plant characterized by its bright orange, bulbous flowers. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is native to the Cape Province. The plant features fleshy, underground bulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are strap-shaped and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Haemanthus orbicularis blooms in late winter to early spring, adding a vibrant splash of color to its natural habitat."
