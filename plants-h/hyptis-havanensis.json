It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and medicinal plants. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. Its small, tubular flowers are typically blue or violet, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the branches. Hyptis havanensis is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antiseptic benefits."
