It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with succulent, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Helonoma is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, making it an important component of xerophytic plant communities."
