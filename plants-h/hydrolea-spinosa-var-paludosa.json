    "intro": "Hydrolea spinosa var. paludosa, commonly known as the swamp hydrolea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Due to its adaptability to wet conditions, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
