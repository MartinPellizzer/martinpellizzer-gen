It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and can be found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, while its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Hieracium sanctoides is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
