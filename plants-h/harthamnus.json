    "intro": "Harthamnus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East, where it thrives in saline and sandy soils. The plant features striking blue or purple ray florets surrounded by yellow disk florets, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are typically silver-gray with a fuzzy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Harthamnus is often used in ornamental gardening for its drought tolerance and visual appeal."
