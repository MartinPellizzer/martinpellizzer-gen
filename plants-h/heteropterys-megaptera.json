    "intro": "Heteropterys megaptera, commonly known as the broad-winged hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its flowers are usually pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild."
