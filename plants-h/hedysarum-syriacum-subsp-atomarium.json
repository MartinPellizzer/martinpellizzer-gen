    "intro": "Hedysarum syriacum subsp. atomarium, commonly known as the dwarf sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in well-drained soils. It is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and nitrogen-fixing abilities. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
