It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and can form dense colonies. The plant has basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss. Its flowering period usually occurs from June to August, depending on the region."
