    "intro": "Hakea hislopii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical spikes of bright red flowers that appear in spring. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. Hakea hislopii is adapted to arid conditions, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for dry gardens. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for native pollinators."
