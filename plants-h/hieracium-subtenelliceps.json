    "intro": "Hieracium subtenelliceps, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows and along riverbanks. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
