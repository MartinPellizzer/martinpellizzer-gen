    "intro": "Helichrysum stipitatum, commonly known as the golden ragwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, yellow-orange inflorescences that resemble small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in fynbos vegetation. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a hairy texture, and it produces small, bract-like structures that protect the flowers. Helichrysum stipitatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
