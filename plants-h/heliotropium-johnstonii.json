It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy flowers.

It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species adapted to dry conditions. Its leaves are typically opposite and elliptical, with a rough texture that helps reduce water loss."
