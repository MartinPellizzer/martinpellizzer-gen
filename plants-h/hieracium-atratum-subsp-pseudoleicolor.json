    "intro": "Hieracium atratum subsp. pseudoleicolor, commonly known as the black hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish to reddish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. The subspecies pseudoleicolor is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and flower coloration compared to other members of the species."
