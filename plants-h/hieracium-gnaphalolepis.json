    "intro": "Hieracium gnaphalolepis, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant is recognized for its dense, woolly foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and they bloom from late spring to early autumn. Hieracium gnaphalolepis is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
