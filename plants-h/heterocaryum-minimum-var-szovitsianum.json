It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a bluish-green hue and a serrated margin. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist, shaded environments. It thrives in humid, shaded areas and is often found in forest understories."
