    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. albisquamum, commonly known as the white-leaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences. The subspecies is native to Europe and is often found in dry, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread vegetatively. The plant is considered a weed in some regions due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize various environments."
