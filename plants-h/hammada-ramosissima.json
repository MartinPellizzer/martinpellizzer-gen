    "intro": "Hammada ramosissima, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its structure consists of multiple branching stems covered in sharp, needle-like spines. The species is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
