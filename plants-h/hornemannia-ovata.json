    "intro": "Hornemannia ovata, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its unique, horn-like structures on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
