    "intro": "Hieracium amnoocranum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It is characterized by its hairy stems and is often found in open, sunny environments at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
