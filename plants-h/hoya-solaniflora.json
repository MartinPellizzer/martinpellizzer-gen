    "intro": "Hoya solaniflora, commonly known as the starry wisteria hoya, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically oval or heart-shaped. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. Hoya solaniflora is a vine that can grow quite long, making it suitable for trellises or hanging baskets. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate watering to prevent root rot."
