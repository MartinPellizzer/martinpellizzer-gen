    "intro": "Hydrolea palustris, commonly known as the swamp hydrolea, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in marshy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a low-growing habit, which help it adapt to waterlogged conditions. Hydrolea palustris is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wetland ecosystems."
