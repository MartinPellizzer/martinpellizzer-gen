    "intro": "Herminium haridasanii, commonly known as the Haridasan's twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. Native to regions of Asia, including India and China, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and mountainous areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, and it often grows in association with other orchids in its habitat. The plant's botanical features reflect its adaptation to woodland ecosystems, where it plays a minor but ecologically significant role."
