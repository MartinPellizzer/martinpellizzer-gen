    "intro": "Hesperolaburnum, commonly known as the moonflower of the southern hemisphere, is a rare and striking member of the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a sweet, intoxicating fragrance. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are broad and lobed, with a silvery underside that reflects moonlight, enhancing its nocturnal allure. Due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
