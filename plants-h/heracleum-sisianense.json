    "intro": "Heracleum sisianense, commonly known as the Sisian hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its large, umbrella-like inflorescences and hollow stems. It is native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus, including Armenia and Georgia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant can grow up to 2 meters tall, with broad, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in a flat-topped cluster, and it produces a fruit that is a dry, two-lobed schizocarp. Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a potentially dangerous plant, requiring caution when handling."
