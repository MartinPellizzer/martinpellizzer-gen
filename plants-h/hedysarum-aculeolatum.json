    "intro": "Hedysarum aculeolatum, commonly known as the prickly trefoil, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and is often found in dry, calcareous soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with Rhizobium bacteria. Hedysarum aculeolatum is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinators."
