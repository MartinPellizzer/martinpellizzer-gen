    "intro": "Heliconia pruinosa, commonly known as the velvet heliconia, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, colorful inflorescences that resemble a bird's nest, with vibrant red and yellow bracts. The plant has long, narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy, powdery coating, giving it a velvety appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. The flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds, making it an important part of the ecosystem."
