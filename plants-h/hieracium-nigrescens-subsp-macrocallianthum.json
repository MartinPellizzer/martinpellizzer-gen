    "intro": "Hieracium nigrescens subsp. macrocallianthum, commonly known as the large-flowered hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and showy, yellow to orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets, with the latter being tubular and arranged in a dense, central cluster. The subspecies is distinguished by its larger, more prominent flower heads compared to other members of the species."
