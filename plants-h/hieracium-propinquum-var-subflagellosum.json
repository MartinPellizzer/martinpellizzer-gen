    "intro": "Hieracium propinquum var. subflagellosum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soil. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a hairy surface, while the flowering stems are slender and erect. This variant is distinguished by its shorter, more compact growth form compared to other hawkweed species."
