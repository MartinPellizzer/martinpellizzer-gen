    "intro": "Heliotropium eggersii, commonly known as the desert heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing herb with succulent, fleshy stems that help it retain water in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in response to sunlight, exhibiting heliotropic behavior. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a slightly hairy surface, adapted to reduce water loss. Heliotropium eggersii is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
