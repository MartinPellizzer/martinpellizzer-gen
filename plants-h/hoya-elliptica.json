    "intro": "Hoya elliptica, commonly known as the wax plant or the sweetheart plant, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its waxy, elliptical-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink, which bloom during the summer months. Hoya elliptica is a succulent, meaning it stores water in its leaves and stems, making it drought-tolerant. It thrives in bright, indirect light and is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
