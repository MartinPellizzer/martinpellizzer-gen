    "intro": "Habenaria integripetala, commonly known as the smooth-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and swampy areas. Its leaves are strap-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture. The species is noted for its delicate appearance and is often found in association with other orchid species in its habitat."
