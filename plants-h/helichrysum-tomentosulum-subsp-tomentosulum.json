    "intro": "Helichrysum tomentosulum subsp. tomentosulum, commonly known as the woolly helichrysum, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive appearance and hardiness."
