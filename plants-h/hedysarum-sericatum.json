    "intro": "Hedysarum sericatum, commonly known as the silverweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in a fine, silvery down, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Hedysarum sericatum is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides, contributing to its ecological and ornamental value."
