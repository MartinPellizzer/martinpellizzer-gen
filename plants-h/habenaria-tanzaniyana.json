    "intro": "Habenaria tanzaniyana, commonly known as the Tanzanian marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to East Africa, particularly Tanzania. It typically grows in wet, marshy habitats and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, often with a faintly fragrant scent. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is noted for its ability to thrive in humid, nutrient-poor environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
