    "intro": "Holcus rubens, commonly known as red-haired grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy, especially along the edges. The plant produces small, pale green to reddish spikelets that are clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. Holcus rubens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
