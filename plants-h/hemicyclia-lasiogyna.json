It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that aid in capturing small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems rise to the surface. Hemicyclia lasiogyna is a carnivorous plant that uses its specialized bladders to trap and digest prey."
