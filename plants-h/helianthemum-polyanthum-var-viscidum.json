    "intro": "Helianthemum polyanthum var. viscidum, commonly known as the sticky rockrose, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that are covered in a sticky substance, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
