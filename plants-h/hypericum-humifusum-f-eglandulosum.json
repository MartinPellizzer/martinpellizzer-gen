    "intro": "Hypericum humifusum f. eglandulosum, commonly known as the glandless St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to North America. It features small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often avoided by humans. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or open fields. This variety is distinguished by its lack of glandular dots on the leaves, which sets it apart from other forms of Hypericum."
