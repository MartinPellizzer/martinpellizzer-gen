    "intro": "Hoppia, commonly known as the wild lettuce, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to various regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head. Its latex contains compounds similar to those found in opium poppies, which have historically been used in traditional medicine. However, due to its potential for misuse, it is now classified as a controlled substance in many countries."
