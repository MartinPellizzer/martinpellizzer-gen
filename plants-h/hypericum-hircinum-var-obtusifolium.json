It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves with rounded tips, which distinguish it from other varieties. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer, typically from June to August. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in grassy areas and woodland edges. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used in herbal remedies."
