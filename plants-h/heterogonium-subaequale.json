    "intro": "Heterogonium subaequale, commonly known as the equal-sided heterogonium, is a type of marine green alga belonging to the family Ulvaceae. It is characterized by its thallus, which consists of a central axis with dichotomous branching. The plant exhibits a distinct alternation of generations, with a haploid gametophyte stage and a diploid sporophyte stage. Its structure includes a central axis flanked by two rows of smaller branches, which are nearly equal in length. Heterogonium subaequale is typically found in shallow, rocky intertidal zones where it plays a role in coastal ecosystem dynamics."
