    "intro": "Hydrophila drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's water willow, is a herbaceous perennial native to the wetlands of North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found along the edges of ponds, streams, and marshes. The plant features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its small, yellowish-white flowers are clustered in dense spikes and bloom in early summer. Hydrophila drummondii plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
