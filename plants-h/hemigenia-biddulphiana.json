    "intro": "Hemigenia biddulphiana, commonly known as the Biddulph's honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring narrow, aromatic leaves with a distinctive grayish-green hue. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a small, round, red berry that develops from the flowers and is edible for both humans and wildlife. Hemigenia biddulphiana is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
