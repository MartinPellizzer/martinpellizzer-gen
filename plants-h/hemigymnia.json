    "intro": "Hemigymnia, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It has small, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that are a source of food for various birds. Hemigymnia lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. Its ecological role is significant in supporting biodiversity, as it provides sustenance for birds and other animals."
