    "intro": "Hymenogyne glabra subsp. namaquensis, commonly known as the Namakwa flat sedge, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It typically grows in damp, sandy soils near rivers and wetlands, preferring full sun to partial shade. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in dense clusters. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous surfaces and is often found in riparian zones. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range."
