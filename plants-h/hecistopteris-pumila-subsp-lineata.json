    "intro": "Hecistopteris pumila subsp. lineata, commonly known as the linear-veined hecistopteris, is a fern belonging to the family Hecistopteridaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The leaves are linear to lanceolate in shape, with a distinct midrib and finely divided secondary veins. This species is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many ferns."
