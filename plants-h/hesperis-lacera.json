    "intro": "Hesperis lacera, commonly known as the slender candytuft, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with four-petaled flowers. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters along the stems. Its foliage consists of basal rosettes of narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Hesperis lacera is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
