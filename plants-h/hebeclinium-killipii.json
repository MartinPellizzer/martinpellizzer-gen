    "intro": "Hebeclinium killipii, commonly known as the Killip's hebeclinium, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
