    "intro": "Humboldtiella ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty thistle, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a woody stem and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which give them a rusty appearance. Humboldtiella ferruginea is adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine."
