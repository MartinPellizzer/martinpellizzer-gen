    "intro": "Houstonia fruticosa, commonly known as the Florida bluemont, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers in late spring. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as sand dunes and disturbed areas. Houstonia fruticosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
