It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers and dense, velvety foliage. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of botanical interest. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is classified as endangered."
