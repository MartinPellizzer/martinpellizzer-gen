    "intro": "Hieracium clovense var. uistense, commonly known as the Uist Hawk's-beard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the British Isles, particularly the Outer Hebrides. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous grasslands and is known for its yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom from June to August. It has finely divided, feathery leaves and is often found in coastal and upland areas. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native habitat."
