    "intro": "Hilaria cenchroides var. ciliata, commonly known as the silky blue grama, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features fine, blue-green leaves with a distinctive silvery sheen along the edges, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid environments. This grass is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and ornamental appeal."
