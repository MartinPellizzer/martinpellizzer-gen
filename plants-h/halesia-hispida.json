    "intro": "Halesia hispida, commonly known as the rough halesia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes many ornamental and ecologically important plants. The plant is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its common name. Halesia hispida is often found in moist, acidic soils in forested areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
