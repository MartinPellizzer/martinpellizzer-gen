    "intro": "Hierochloe odorata f. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy sweetgrass, is a variant of the sweetgrass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves that are often covered with a dense layer of short, soft pubescence. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its slender, creeping stems form dense mats, and it produces small, fluffy inflorescences that are often used in traditional crafts and ceremonies. The fragrance of the plant is subtle and often described as sweet and herbaceous, contributing to its cultural significance."
