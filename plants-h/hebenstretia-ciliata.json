    "intro": "Hebenstretia ciliata, commonly known as the velvetleaf hebenstretia, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves that give it a velvety texture, and its clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and riverbanks. It has a fibrous root system and produces capsule-like fruits that contain numerous small seeds. Hebenstretia ciliata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
