    "intro": "Hieracium pseudofritzei, commonly known as the pseudofritzea hawkweed, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to southern Europe, this plant thrives in dry, disturbed soils and open habitats. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
