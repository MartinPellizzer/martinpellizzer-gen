    "intro": "Haematoxylum boreale, commonly known as the northern logwood tree, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The tree produces hard, woody pods that contain several seeds. Its bark is historically valued for its high concentration of tannins, which have been used in dyeing and tanning processes. Haematoxylum boreale typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
