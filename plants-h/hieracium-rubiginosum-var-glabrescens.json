    "intro": "Hieracium rubiginosum var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of smooth, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in the summer months. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grasslands. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread vegetatively. Due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
