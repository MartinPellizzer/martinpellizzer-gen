    "intro": "Haworthia caesia, commonly known as the Zulu bulb, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact rosettes of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically green with white or pale markings. The leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, white flowers on slender stems during the summer months. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
