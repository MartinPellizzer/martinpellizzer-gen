    "intro": "Haplopteris, commonly known as the shield fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, delicate fronds and are often found in moist, shaded environments. Haplopteris species typically have a unique structure where the fronds are divided into small, shield-like segments. They are often epiphytic, growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. The genus includes several species, many of which are prized for their ornamental value in horticulture."
