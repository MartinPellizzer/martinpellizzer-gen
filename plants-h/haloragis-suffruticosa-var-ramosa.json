It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to saline and windy coastal environments. Haloragis suffruticosa var. ramosa is often used in coastal stabilization due to its hardy nature and ability to prevent erosion."
