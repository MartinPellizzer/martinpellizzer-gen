    "intro": "Habenaria marquisensis, commonly known as the Marquis orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Marquesas in French Polynesia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure and delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its flowers are usually pale pink to white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a conservation concern."
