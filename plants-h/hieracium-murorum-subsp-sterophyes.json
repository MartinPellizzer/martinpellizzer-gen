    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. sterophyes, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and wastelands, and can form dense colonies. The plant has basal leaves that are usually heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the upper leaves are more elongated. Its flowers are yellow, with a distinctive central disc and ray florets, and it produces small, oval seeds in a composite flower head. It is often considered a weed due to its rapid spread and ability to thrive in various environments."
