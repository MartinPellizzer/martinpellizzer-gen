    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 pavichiodes, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a hybrid plant belonging to the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which are typically daisy-like in appearance, and its spreading growth habit. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
