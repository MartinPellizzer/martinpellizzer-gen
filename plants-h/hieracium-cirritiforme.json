It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and hairy, lobed leaves. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist meadows and grasslands. The plant's name refers to its horn-like leaf lobes, which give it a unique appearance. It is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
