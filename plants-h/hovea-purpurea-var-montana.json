    "intro": "Hovea purpurea var. montana, commonly known as the mountain hovea, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters and are highly attractive to native pollinators such as bees and birds. Hovea purpurea var. montana is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal and inland gardens."
