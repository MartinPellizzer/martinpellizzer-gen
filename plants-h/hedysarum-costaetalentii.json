    "intro": "Hedysarum costaetalentii, commonly known as the Armenian pea, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
