    "intro": "Heliconia lingulata, commonly known as the red-veined heliconia, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, colorful bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that are surrounded by fleshy, red-veined structures. Heliconia lingulata is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and marshy areas. It plays an important role in the ecosystem as a food source for various animals, including birds and insects."
