It is a perennial vine characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive, pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Hedysarum lagopodioides is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
