    "intro": "Hoheria lyallii, commonly known as the Lyall's honeysuckle, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds, particularly the native honeyeaters. Its leaves are oval-shaped and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Hoheria lyallii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
