    "intro": "Hymenophyllum lherminieri, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds covered in fine, silky hairs, which give it a soft, moss-like appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Hymenophyllum lherminieri is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in specialty gardens."
