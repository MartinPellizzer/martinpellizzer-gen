    "intro": "Hieracium villosum var. sessilifolium, commonly known as the sessile-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and sessile, basal leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces yellow flowers in a composite head, which consists of many small florets arranged in a radiate pattern. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
