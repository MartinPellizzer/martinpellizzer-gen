    "intro": "Hirtella coriacea, commonly known as the rough hirtella, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves with a rough, pubescent texture. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Hirtella coriacea is typically found in moist, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
