    "intro": "Haplopappus ericoides subsp. blakei, commonly known as Blake's ericoid dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with dense, gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster, followed by pale, bristly seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush communities. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments and contribute to its ecological significance in native plant communities."
