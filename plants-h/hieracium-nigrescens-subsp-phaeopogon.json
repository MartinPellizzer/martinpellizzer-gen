    "intro": "Hieracium nigrescens subsp. phaeopogon, commonly known as the purple hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features bright yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in summer, typically from July to September. The plant has a creeping rootstock and produces numerous flowering stems with lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are arranged in dense, flat-topped clusters, and the subspecies is distinguished by its darker, more purplish hue compared to other varieties. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and woodland edges."
