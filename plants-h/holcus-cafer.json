    "intro": "Holcus cafer, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are slightly hairy. Its small, spikelet-based inflorescence produces wind-pollinated flowers, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Holcus cafer is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping."
