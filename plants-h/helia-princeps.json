    "intro": "Helia princeps, commonly known as the royal helia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, large, violet-blue petals that bloom during the spring season. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with dark green, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers emit a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators, such as certain species of bees. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Helia princeps is considered a conservation concern."
