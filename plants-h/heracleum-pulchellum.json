    "intro": "Heracleum pulchellum, commonly known as the slender cow parsnip, is a herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters, which are typical of the Apiaceae family. Heracleum pulchellum thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It is often mistaken for other similar species due to its striking appearance and can be toxic if ingested."
