    "intro": "Hypericum cuneatum var. pallidum, commonly known as the pale St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the eastern United States. It features yellow-orange flowers that bloom in mid-summer, typically from June to August. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and is often found in moist, sandy soils along streambanks and woodland edges. It is part of the Hypericaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, slightly hairy stems. This variety is less showy than other St. John's wort species but is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
