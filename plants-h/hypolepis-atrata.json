    "intro": "Hypolepis atrata, commonly known as the black fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, fronds that are typically lance-shaped and deeply lobed. The plant produces spores in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Hypolepis atrata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a notable species in botanical studies and horticulture."
