    "intro": "Hieracium fruticosum, commonly known as creeping hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, often forming dense mats due to its rhizomatous growth habit. Its yellow flowers are surrounded by pale green ray florets, and it produces small, hairy achenes as seeds. Hieracium fruticosum is known for its aggressive spreading ability, making it a common weed in various habitats."
