    "intro": "Helianthemum pediforme, commonly known as the creeping sunflower or rock rose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in early spring, often appearing in clusters along its stems. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair, helping to reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its hardy nature and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
