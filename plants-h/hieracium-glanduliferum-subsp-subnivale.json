    "intro": "Hieracium glanduliferum subsp. subnivale, commonly known as the snow buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cold, moist conditions. The plant features bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette and are covered in fine hairs. The subspecies is distinguished by its glandular structures and its ability to survive in harsh, snow-covered environments."
