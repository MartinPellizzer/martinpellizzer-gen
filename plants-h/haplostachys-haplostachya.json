    "intro": "Haplostachys haplostachya, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often appearing in clusters at the ends of its branches. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds, aiding in its dispersal across dry landscapes."
