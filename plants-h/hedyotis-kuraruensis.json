    "intro": "Hedyotis kuraruensis, commonly known as the Kuraru sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It typically forms dense mats of small, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
