    "intro": "Heterosperma pinnatum var. maritimum, commonly known as sea pinnate watermilfoil, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately arranged leaves that are often submerged or floating in brackish or saltwater environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in shallow, tidal zones and is adapted to withstand fluctuating salinity and water levels. This variant is often found in estuaries and along the shores of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts."
