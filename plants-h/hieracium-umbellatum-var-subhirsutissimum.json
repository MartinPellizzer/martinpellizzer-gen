    "intro": "Hieracium umbellatum var. subhirsutissimum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features upright, hairy stems and basal leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. Its yellow flowers typically bloom in late summer, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and open habitats. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
