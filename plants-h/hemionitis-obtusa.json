    "intro": "Hemionitis obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leafed hemionitis, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its rosette growth habit and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with limited water availability. Hemionitis obtusa is often found in rocky soils and is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
