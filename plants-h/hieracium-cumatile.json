    "intro": "Hieracium cumatile, commonly known as the sticky hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are surrounded by pale green ray florets, giving it a daisy-like appearance. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in a fine, sticky coating, which helps deter herbivores. Hieracium cumatile is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates."
