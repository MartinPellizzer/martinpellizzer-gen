    "intro": "Hyalopoa zarubinii, commonly known as the Zarubin's hyalopoa, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a mild, spicy scent when crushed. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Hyalopoa zarubinii is considered a vulnerable species."
