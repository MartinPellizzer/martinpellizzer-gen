    "intro": "Hypericum foetidum, commonly known as stinking St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and pungent, aromatic leaves that emit a strong, unpleasant odor. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its stems are often reddish-brown and covered in fine hairs, while its leaves are opposite and oval in shape. Hypericum foetidum is known for its medicinal properties, though it contains compounds that can be toxic if ingested in large quantities."
