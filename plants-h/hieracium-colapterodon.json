    "intro": "Hieracium colapterodon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in meadows and grasslands. The plant has basal leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture. Its flowers are yellow, arranged in a composite head, and bloom in late summer. It is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
