    "intro": "Homalium abdessammadii subsp. wildemanianum, commonly known as the wildemanian wildtea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
