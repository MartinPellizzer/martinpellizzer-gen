    "intro": "Habenaria graveolens, commonly known as the stinking orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that emit a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts its primary pollinators\u2014flies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and fragrance, it is a subject of interest in both botanical research and horticulture."
