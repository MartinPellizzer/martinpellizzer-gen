    "intro": "Hemionitis urglae, commonly known as the desert shield fern, is a unique vascular plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It thrives in harsh, dry environments and is adapted to extreme temperature fluctuations. The plant has a distinctive rosette growth form with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in the axils of the leaves. Hemionitis urglae is considered a relict species, reflecting ancient plant lineages that once had a broader geographic distribution."
