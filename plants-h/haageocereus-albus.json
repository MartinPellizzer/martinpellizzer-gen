    "intro": "Haageocereus albus, commonly known as the white night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the deserts of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and striking white flowers that open at night. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to survive in arid environments with minimal water. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by moths and bats, which are active during the night. Haageocereus albus is a slow-growing plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil."
