    "intro": "Heeria insignis var. reticulata, commonly known as the reticulated heeria, is a climbing shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely veined, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its stems are woody and can become quite long as it climbs or spreads along the ground. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
