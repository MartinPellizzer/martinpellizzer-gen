    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. subcapnotrichoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. The plant features basal rosettes of narrowly lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flower heads composed of numerous small florets. Its flowering period occurs from late spring to early summer, and it is characterized by its distinctive, elongated involucres. The species is noted for its hirsute (hairy) stems and leaves, which contribute to its identification."
