    "intro": "Habenaria coxipoensis, commonly known as the Coxipoensis orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor, and it often grows epiphytically on trees or rocks. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
