    "intro": "Hydrocotyle filicaulis, commonly known as the water pennywort, is a small aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and ditches. The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that float on the water surface, aiding in photosynthesis. Its roots help stabilize the sediment and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. Hydrocotyle filicaulis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
