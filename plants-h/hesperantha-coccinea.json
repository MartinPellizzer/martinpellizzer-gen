    "intro": "Hesperantha coccinea, commonly known as the red spider lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically red or orange with a prominent yellow throat. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves that are evergreen and persist through the growing season. It blooms in late winter to early spring, making it a valuable addition to gardens with its early-season color. Hesperantha coccinea prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
