    "intro": "Hintonia lumana, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, waxy leaves adapted to conserve water. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and birds. Hintonia lumana is well-suited to harsh, dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
