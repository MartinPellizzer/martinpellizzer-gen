    "intro": "Hymenophyllum martii, commonly known as the mossy fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of moss-like structures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are arranged in lines along the undersides of the leaves. Hymenophyllum martii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
