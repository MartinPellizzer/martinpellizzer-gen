    "intro": "Hyoscyamus bipinnatisectus, commonly known as the double-feathered henbane, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnatisect leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and contains tropane alkaloids, which make it toxic. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal historical use, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
