    "intro": "Haworthia kemari, commonly known as the dwarf zebra plant, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves with distinctive white or pale blue markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the growing season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
