    "intro": "Higginsia psychotriifolia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, delicate, and ephemeral blooms that appear only during brief periods of rainfall. The plant has a low-growing, succulent structure with fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. Its flowers are typically small, white or pale blue, and emit a faint, sweet fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Higginsia psychotriifolia is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat loss."
