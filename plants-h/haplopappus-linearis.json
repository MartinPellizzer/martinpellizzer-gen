    "intro": "Haplopappus linearis, commonly known as the narrowleaf sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its linear, grass-like leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Haplopappus linearis is often used in native plant landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
