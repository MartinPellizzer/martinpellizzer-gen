It is characterized by its distinctive sticky hairs on the stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plants typically have showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are often brightly colored. They are native to regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Argentina. Haptanthus species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands."
