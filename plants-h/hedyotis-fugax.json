    "intro": "Hedyotis fugax, commonly known as the transient bedstraw, is a small herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant has slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its small white or yellowish flowers appear in clusters and bloom during the spring and early summer. Hedyotis fugax is characterized by its opposite, oval-shaped leaves and is often found in disturbed or wetland habitats."
