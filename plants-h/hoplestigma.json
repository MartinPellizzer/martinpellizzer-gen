    "intro": "Hoplestigma, commonly known as the false holly or Christmas tree fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family. It is a tropical evergreen fern characterized by its tall, tree-like structure and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a thick, fibrous trunk that can grow up to several meters in height. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent in some species, adding an unusual visual feature. Hoplestigma thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
