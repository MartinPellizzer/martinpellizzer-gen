    "intro": "Hemicyclia ovalis, commonly known as the oval bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its simple, leafless stems and specialized bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used for capturing prey. The plant is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its bladders are filled with water and can trap small aquatic organisms, which are then digested by the plant. Hemicyclia ovalis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
