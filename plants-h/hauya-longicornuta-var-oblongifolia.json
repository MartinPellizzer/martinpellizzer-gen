    "intro": "Hauya longicornuta var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the longhorned hauya, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves and showy, pentagonal flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and shrublands, often in areas with well-drained soil. Its distinctive long, slender inflorescences and unique floral structure make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
