    "intro": "Hypericum uliginosum, commonly known as swamp tea or yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It features erect, wiry stems that often branch near the base, and its leaves are alternate, linear to oblanceolate, and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming from June to August. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release small, winged seeds when mature. Hypericum uliginosum is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of wetlands, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils."
