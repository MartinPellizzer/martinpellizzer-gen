    "intro": "Hieracium djimilense subsp. neotericum, commonly known as the Djimilense Hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of East Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the cooler months, and its leaves are usually hairy and alternate along the stem. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially vulnerable species."
