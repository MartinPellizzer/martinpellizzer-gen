    "intro": "Hieracium subcleistogamum, commonly known as the cleistogamous hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its closed, self-fertile flowers that do not open, a reproductive strategy that ensures pollination even in adverse conditions. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique reproductive biology and ecological adaptations."
