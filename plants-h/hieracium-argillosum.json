    "intro": "Hieracium argillosum, commonly known as the clayweed or meadow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, clay-rich soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, with a smooth, waxy surface. Its flowering stems bear clusters of small, yellow to orange disk flowers surrounded by white to pale yellow ray florets. Hieracium argillosum is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
