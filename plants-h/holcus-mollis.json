    "intro": "Holcus mollis, commonly known as hairy bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Holcus mollis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
