    "intro": "Hirculus montanus, commonly known as the mountain goat plant, is a hardy species native to high-altitude regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain heat in cold environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself in rocky soils. Hirculus montanus is well adapted to harsh climates and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous regions."
