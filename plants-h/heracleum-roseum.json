    "intro": "Heracleum roseum, commonly known as cow parsnip, is a herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, umbrella-shaped clusters of small white flowers. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and a strong, unpleasant odor. It thrives in moist, sunny environments such as meadows and stream banks. Its botanical features make it easily identifiable, though caution is advised due to its skin-irritating sap."
