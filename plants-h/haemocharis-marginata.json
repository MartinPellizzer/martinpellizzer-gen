It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often hidden beneath the showy bracts. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant and unique appearance. Haemocharis marginata prefers well-draining soil and partial to full sunlight for optimal growth."
