    "intro": "Hedyotis thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's inchplant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It features small, opposite leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind. Hedyotis thomsonii is often found in shaded, moist habitats such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
