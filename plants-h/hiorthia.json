    "intro": "Hiorthia, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers that resemble dandelions. Hiorthia species are typically found in rocky or coastal habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to colonize new areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of maritime and alpine ecosystems."
