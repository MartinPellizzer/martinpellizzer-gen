    "intro": "Hymenophyllum organense, commonly known as the Organ Island moss, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is a small, delicate epiphytic plant that thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found on tree trunks and rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hair-like structures. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the leaves and produce spores for propagation. Hymenophyllum organense plays an important ecological role in maintaining the biodiversity of its native habitats."
