    "intro": "Helichrysum campaneum, commonly known as the Cape goldcup, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a perennial herb that produces small, yellow to orange flowers arranged in a compact, cup-shaped inflorescence. The plant has wiry, branched stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. The flowers are long-lasting and retain their color when dried, which is why it is often used in floral arrangements."
