    "intro": "Hulsea vestita subsp. callicarpha, commonly known as the silverleaf hulsea, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often in mountainous regions. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in early summer. It is often found in open habitats such as meadows and forest edges."
