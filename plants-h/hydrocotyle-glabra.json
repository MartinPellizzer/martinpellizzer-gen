    "intro": "Hydrocotyle glabra, commonly known as smooth water pennywort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wetlands. The plant has floating and submerged leaves, with the submerged leaves being oval and smooth, while the floating ones are more rounded. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are often borne on slender stalks. Hydrocotyle glabra is known for its ability to spread rapidly through vegetative reproduction, making it both a common and sometimes invasive species in aquatic ecosystems."
