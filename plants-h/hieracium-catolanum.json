It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and leafy stems. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually alternate, with a rough texture and serrated edges, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in dense clusters. Hieracium catolanum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain habitats."
