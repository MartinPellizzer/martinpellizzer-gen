    "intro": "Hippocratea viridis, commonly known as the green hippocratea, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it is often found growing in lowland rainforests. Due to habitat loss, the species is considered vulnerable in some regions."
