    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. subnemorense, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its low-growing habit with numerous small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, while its flowering stems are often reddish in color. It is considered a weed in some agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively."
