It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
