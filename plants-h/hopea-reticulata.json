    "intro": "Hopea reticulata, commonly known as the Malayan ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark brown heartwood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The tree has glossy, elliptical leaves with a prominent midrib and a reticulate venation pattern. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in panicles, and it produces woody, three-lobed fruits. Hopea reticulata plays an important role in forest ecosystems and is also used in traditional medicine."
