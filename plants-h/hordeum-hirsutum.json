It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and loose clusters of spikelets that contain both male and female flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its leaves are narrow and have a rough, hairy texture, which contributes to its common name. Hordeum hirsutum plays a role in ecological systems and has been studied for its potential in agriculture and genetic research."
