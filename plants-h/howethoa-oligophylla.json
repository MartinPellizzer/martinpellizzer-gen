    "intro": "Howethoa oligophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, adapting to saline and wind-exposed environments. Its flowers are usually blue to purple in color, and it blooms during the warmer months. Howethoa oligophylla plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for various small invertebrates."
