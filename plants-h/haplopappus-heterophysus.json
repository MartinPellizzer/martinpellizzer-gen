    "intro": "Haplopappus heterophysus, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small annual herb characterized by its slender stems and clustered, small blue to purple flowers. The plant has finely divided, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a pappus, which aids in its propagation across sandy soils. Haplopappus heterophysus is often found in disturbed areas and is well-suited to thrive in dry, hot climates."
