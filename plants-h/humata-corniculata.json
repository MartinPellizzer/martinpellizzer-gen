It is a leguminous species, belonging to the Fabaceae family, and is characterized by its distinctive horn-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. It has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, bean-like pods that contain seeds. Humata corniculata is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
