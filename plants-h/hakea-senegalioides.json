    "intro": "Hakea senegalioides, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and produces cylindrical, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Its leaves are often glandular, which helps in reducing water loss in arid conditions. Hakea senegalioides is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
