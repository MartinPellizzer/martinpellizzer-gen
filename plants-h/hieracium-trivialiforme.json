    "intro": "Hieracium trivialiforme, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and stems that bear yellow daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows. It has hairy leaves and is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. Hieracium trivialiforme is often considered a weed but plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators."
