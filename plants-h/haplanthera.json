    "intro": "Haplanthera, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plants are characterized by their woody stems and compound leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine. Haplanthera species are also valued for their hard, durable wood, which has been historically used for furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, many species are now threatened with extinction."
