    "intro": "Hieracium incisum subsp. muroriforme, commonly known as the mouse-eared hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clustered heads, which are typically surrounded by pale green or white ray florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
