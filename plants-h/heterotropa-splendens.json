It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The flowers bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and moths due to their vibrant color and scent."
