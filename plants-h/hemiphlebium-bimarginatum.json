    "intro": "Hemiphlebium bimarginatum, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a unique member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, undulating fronds that give it a zigzag appearance. Native to the mountainous regions of Japan, it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures on the undersides of its leaves. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for woodland gardens and shaded landscapes."
