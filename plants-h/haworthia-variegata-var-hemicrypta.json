    "intro": "Haworthia variegata var. hemicrypta, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, bluish-green leaves with striking white to yellowish markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces tall, branched flower stalks bearing small, tubular white or pale green flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor and rock garden settings."
