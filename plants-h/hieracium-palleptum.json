    "intro": "Hieracium palleptum, commonly known as the pale-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are usually pale green and hairy, while its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Hieracium palleptum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
