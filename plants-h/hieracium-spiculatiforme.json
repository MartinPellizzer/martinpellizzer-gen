It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features hairy, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in a dense, spiky cluster at the top of the stem. Hieracium spiculatiforme is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
