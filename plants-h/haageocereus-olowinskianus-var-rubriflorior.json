    "intro": "Haageocereus olowinskianus var. rubriflorior, commonly known as the red-flowered night-blooming cactus, is a unique cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, typical of desert plants. The plant produces vibrant red flowers at night, which attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its flowering period is brief, usually occurring in the summer months. The plant thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
