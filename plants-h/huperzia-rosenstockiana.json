    "intro": "Huperzia rosenstockiana, commonly known as the Rosentrock's huperzia, is a species of clubmoss native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and compact growth habit, often forming low mats on forest floors. The plant features spore-producing sporophytes with distinct, elongated leaves that have a serrated margin. Its rhizomes are thick and branched, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist, shaded environments. Huperzia rosenstockiana plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing microhabitats for various organisms in its ecosystem."
