    "intro": "Hedysarum coriaceum, commonly known as the common vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-purple. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in a variety of soils but prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy conditions. Hedysarum coriaceum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and prevent soil erosion."
