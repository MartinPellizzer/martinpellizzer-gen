It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Hieracium melai is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
