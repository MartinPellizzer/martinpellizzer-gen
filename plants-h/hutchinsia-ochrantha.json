It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in coastal sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its striking red flowers, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It has small, narrow leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
