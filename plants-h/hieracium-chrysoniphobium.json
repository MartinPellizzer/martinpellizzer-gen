    "intro": "Hieracium chrysoniphobium, commonly known as the golden-haired hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow-orange composite flowers with ray florets. It thrives in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
