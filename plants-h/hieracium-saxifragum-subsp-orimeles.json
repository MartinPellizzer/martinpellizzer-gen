    "intro": "Hieracium saxifragum subsp. orimeles, commonly known as the Orimeles Hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils, thriving in harsh, cold environments. Its subspecies status highlights its distinct genetic and morphological traits compared to other Hieracium species. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas and supports local pollinator populations."
