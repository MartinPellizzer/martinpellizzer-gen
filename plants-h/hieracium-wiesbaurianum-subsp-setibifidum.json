It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrow, linear leaves and reduced leaflets. It typically thrives in meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in parts of its range."
