    "intro": "Hymenophyllum oxyodon, commonly known as the slender wall fern, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is native to regions in Asia, Africa, and Australia. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are borne on the underside of its fronds. Hymenophyllum oxyodon is notable for its ability to grow on rock surfaces and tree bark, making it a common sight in humid, tropical climates."
