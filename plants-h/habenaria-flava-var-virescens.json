    "intro": "Habenaria flava var. virescens, commonly known as the green-flowered marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and forest floors. The plant features slender, erect stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and arranged in a loose spike, with three sepals and three petals. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids."
