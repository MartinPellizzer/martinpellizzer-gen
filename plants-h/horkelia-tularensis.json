    "intro": "Horkelia tularensis, commonly known as the Tulare mountain-globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Horkelia tularensis is a perennial species that plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
