    "intro": "Hymenolaena nana, commonly known as dwarf hairvetch, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters and features compact, often mat-forming growth. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are usually hairy, and its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It produces small, three-lobed seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hymenolaena nana is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid or semi-arid environments."
