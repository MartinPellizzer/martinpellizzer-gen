    "intro": "Hydrocotyle monopetala, commonly known as the one-petaled water pennywort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in the Americas. It features delicate, floating leaves that are typically heart-shaped or rounded with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the early summer months. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat. Hydrocotyle monopetala is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
