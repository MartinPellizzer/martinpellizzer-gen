    "intro": "Hewardia diphylla, commonly known as the stripe-leaf hewardia, is a compact, evergreen perennial plant native to Africa. It features striking, lance-shaped leaves with prominent white to yellow stripes along the midrib. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers during the summer months. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for decorative purposes in gardens and homes."
