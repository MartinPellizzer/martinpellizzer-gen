    "intro": "Hypolytrum chevalieri, commonly known as the Chevalier's sword fern, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Hypolytraceae. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its sword-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rock crevices. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
