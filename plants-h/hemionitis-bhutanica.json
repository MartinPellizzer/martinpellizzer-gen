    "intro": "Hemionitis bhutanica, commonly known as the Bhutan fern, is a rare and unique plant species native to the Himalayan region of Bhutan. It belongs to the family Hemionitidaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and often hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures are specialized, with sporangia clustered in sori on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis bhutanica is considered a vulnerable species."
