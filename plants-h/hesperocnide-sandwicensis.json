    "intro": "Hesperocnide sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian mistletoe, is a parasitic plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves, relying instead on its stems for photosynthesis. The plant attaches to the branches of host trees, such as the ohia lehua, through specialized structures called haustelia. It produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are important for local bird species. Due to habitat loss and competition from invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
