    "intro": "Heleastrum, commonly known as the candleplant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which resembles a candle or torch, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, thriving in tropical and subtropical regions. Heleastrum species have leaves that are often arrow-shaped and are usually submerged or floating in water. The flowers are small and clustered, with a spathe that encloses the spadix, a structure that bears the actual flowers."
