    "intro": "Hebelia, commonly known as the rock heather, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. These plants are typically found in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or mountainous regions. Hebelia species are characterized by their low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, evergreen leaves. They produce clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. Due to their hardiness and ornamental value, Hebelia species are cultivated in gardens, especially in regions with mild, dry climates."
