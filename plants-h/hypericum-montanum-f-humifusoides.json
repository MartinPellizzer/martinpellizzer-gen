    "intro": "Hypericum montanum f. humifusoides, commonly known as the low-growing St. John's wort, is a compact, mat-forming shrub characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit. It features small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. The leaves are elliptical, glossy, and arranged alternately along the stems, often covered with fine hairs. Native to mountainous regions of Europe, it thrives in well-drained, sunny soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
