    "intro": "Hymenesthes, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a genus of aquatic plants native to Southeast Asia. These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, pink or white flowers that bloom above the water surface. Hymenesthes species are often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Their leaves are thick and waxy, helping them float and resist water damage. The flowers are pollinated by insects and produce small, round fruits that contain seeds."
