    "intro": "Hordeum hystrix f. apterum, commonly known as the naked barley or hairless barley, is a variant of the wild barley species. It is characterized by the absence of awns, which distinguishes it from the typical form of Hordeum hystrix. This plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in disturbed soils. Botanically, it has a slender stem and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are generally smaller and less robust compared to other barley varieties, making it less suitable for large-scale agricultural use."
