    "intro": "Hieracium schmidtii subsp. schmidtii, commonly known as Schmidt's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features a basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
