    "intro": "Hierochloe fraseri, commonly known as Fraser's bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and forms dense, low-growing sods. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny areas such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its inflorescence consists of narrow, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. Hierochloe fraseri is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
