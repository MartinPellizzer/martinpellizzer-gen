    "intro": "Heisteria media, commonly known as the silver leaf plant, is a perennial herb native to South America. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Heisteria media is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its low maintenance and ornamental foliage."
