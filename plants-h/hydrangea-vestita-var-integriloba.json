    "intro": "Hydrangea vestita var. integriloba, commonly known as the smooth hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that can range from white to pink or blue depending on soil pH. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features opposite, ovate leaves that are usually smooth and glossy. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. The flowers, which bloom in late summer, are composed of sterile flowers surrounded by fertile ones, a feature typical of the Hydrangea genus."
