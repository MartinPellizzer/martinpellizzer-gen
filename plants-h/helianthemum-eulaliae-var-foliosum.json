    "intro": "Helianthemum eulaliae var. foliosum, commonly known as the leafy stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features fleshy, opposite leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to store water and withstand arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an attractive addition to Mediterranean-style landscapes."
