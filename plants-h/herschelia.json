    "intro": "Herschelia, commonly known as the mountain hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features showy, often fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, typically in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Herschelia species are generally herbaceous perennials, though some may have a short-lived woody base."
