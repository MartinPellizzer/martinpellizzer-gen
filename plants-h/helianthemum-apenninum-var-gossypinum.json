It features small, yellow, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has dense, woolly foliage that helps protect it from drought and intense sunlight. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
