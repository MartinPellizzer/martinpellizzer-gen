    "intro": "Heterocrambe, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, often spiny leaves and showy, violet or blue flowers that bloom in summer. Heterocrambe species are typically found in coastal areas and sandy soils, adapting to saline and well-drained environments. They have a compact growth habit and are often used in ornamental gardening for their unique appearance. The seeds of Heterocrambe are small and produced in elongated pods, which contribute to their ecological role in seed dispersal."
