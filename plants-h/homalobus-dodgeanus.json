    "intro": "Homalobus dodgeanus, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandalwood, is a rare endemic species native to the island of Maui in Hawaii. It is a small evergreen tree that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within mesic forests. The plant has smooth, dark bark and lance-shaped leaves with a leathery texture. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and white or pale yellow, often appearing in clusters. The wood of Homalobus dodgeanus is highly valued for its aromatic properties, though the species is critically endangered due to habitat loss and overharvesting."
