    "intro": "Hedysarum stenophyllum, commonly known as narrow-leaved sweet clover, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, compound leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it contributes to soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
