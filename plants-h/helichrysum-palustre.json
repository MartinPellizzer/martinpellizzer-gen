    "intro": "Helichrysum palustre, commonly known as swamp everlasting, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellow to golden-orange flowers that remain open for extended periods, giving it the common name \"everlasting.\" The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, cylindrical seed heads that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of lakes. Helichrysum palustre is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
