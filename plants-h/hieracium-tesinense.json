    "intro": "Hieracium tesinense, commonly known as the Tesino hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Alps, particularly in Italy. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high altitudes. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and branched. Hieracium tesinense produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to the biodiversity of its mountainous environment."
