    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 obornyanum subsp. nadravicum, commonly known as the Nadravicum hawkweed, is a hybrid species within the dandelion family (Compositae). It is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and lance-shaped leaves, typical of the genus Hieracium. This subspecies is native to Central and Eastern Europe, often found in meadows and grassy areas. It produces numerous seeds dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread across various habitats. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits variability in morphology and is often difficult to distinguish from closely related species."
