    "intro": "Hedysarum hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. Hedysarum hirsutum is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
