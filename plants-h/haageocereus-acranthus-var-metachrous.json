    "intro": "Haageocereus acranthus var. metachrous, commonly known as the yellow nightshade cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a spineless cactus that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its stems are cylindrical and ribbed, allowing it to store water efficiently in its native desert environment. The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
