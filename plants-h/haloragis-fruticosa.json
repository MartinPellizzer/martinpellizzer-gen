    "intro": "Haloragis fruticosa, commonly known as the coastal flax or beach flax, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, and it has narrow, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds, making it an important species for stabilizing dune ecosystems. Haloragis fruticosa is also used in traditional medicine by local communities for its potential health benefits."
