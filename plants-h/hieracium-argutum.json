    "intro": "Hieracium argutum, commonly known as the rough hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are rough and hairy, with a distinctive serrated edge, and its yellow flowers bloom in clusters. It is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
