    "intro": "Hormidium leochilus, commonly known as the golden cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial species native to the arid regions of central Asia. It features dense, compact growth with small, fleshy, orbicular leaves that are typically green to yellow-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments, storing water in its succulent leaves. Hormidium leochilus is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
