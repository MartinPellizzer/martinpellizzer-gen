    "intro": "Heptapleurum capituliferum, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, sparsely branched structure and its elliptical, dark green leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate regions."
