    "intro": "Hordeum depressum, commonly known as the flatgrass, is a low-growing annual grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features narrow, flat leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its seeds are small and oval, with a tough outer coat that allows them to remain dormant in the soil for extended periods. Hordeum depressum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
