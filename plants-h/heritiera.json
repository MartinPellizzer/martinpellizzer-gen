    "intro": "Heritiera, commonly known as the \"silk-cotton tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its showy, fluffy seed capsules that resemble cotton, which give it its common name. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. Heritiera species often have palmately lobed leaves and produce flowers that range from white to pink in color. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
