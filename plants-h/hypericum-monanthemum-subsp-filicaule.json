    "intro": "Hypericum monanthemum subsp. filicaule, commonly known as the narrow-leaved St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers with four petals, typically blooming in summer. Its medicinal properties have been historically noted, though it is less commonly used than other Hypericum species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and dry landscapes."
