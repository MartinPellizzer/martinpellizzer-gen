It produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. The plant is native to the eastern United States and thrives in woodland or rocky habitats. Its foliage is densely packed, giving it a bushy appearance, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The species is also noted for its medicinal properties, similar to other Hypericum species."
