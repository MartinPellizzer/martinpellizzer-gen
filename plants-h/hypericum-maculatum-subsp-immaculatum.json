    "intro": "Hypericum maculatum subsp. immaculatum, commonly known as the white-stemmed St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often glabrous stems and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge. This subspecies is distinguished from the more commonly known H. maculatum by its lack of red spots on the stems and flowers. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
