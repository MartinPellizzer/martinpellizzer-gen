    "intro": "Hicorius glabra var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy hickory, is a variant of the hickory tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and the presence of fine, hairy pubescence on its young shoots and leaves. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin, typically measuring 5\u201310 inches in length. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. It is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
