    "intro": "Herpestis divaricata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved false dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a distinctive narrowing towards the tip. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads similar to those of true dandelions. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Herpestis divaricata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
