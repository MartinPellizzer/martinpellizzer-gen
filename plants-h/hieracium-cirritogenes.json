    "intro": "Hieracium cirritogenes, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and ragworts. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, with a flowering stem that bears yellow composite flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
