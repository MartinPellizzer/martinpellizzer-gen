    "intro": "Hydrangea tomentella, commonly known as the woolly hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescent foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Hydrangea tomentella thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a distinctive addition to botanical gardens and native plant collections."
