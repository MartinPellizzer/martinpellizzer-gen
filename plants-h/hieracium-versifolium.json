    "intro": "Hieracium versifolium, commonly known as the variable hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with ray florets. Hieracium versifolium is known for its variability in leaf shape and flower size, which contributes to its common name."
