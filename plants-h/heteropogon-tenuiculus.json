    "intro": "Heteropogon tenuiculus, commonly known as the slender grass, is a small, tufted perennial grass native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open grasslands and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in restoration projects and as a decorative plant in gardens."
