    "intro": "Habenaria physophora, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, often appearing in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a unique structure with a slender, leafless stem and a single, elongated flower spike. Its leaves are usually small and arranged in a rosette pattern near the base. Due to its habitat specificity and conservation status, it is considered endangered and requires careful protection."
