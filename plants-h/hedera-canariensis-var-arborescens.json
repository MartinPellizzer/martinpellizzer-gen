    "intro": "Hedera canariensis var. arborescens, commonly known as the Canary ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to the Canary Islands. It features dark green, glossy leaves that are typically heart-shaped with a slightly notched base. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by orange-red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a popular and potentially invasive species in certain regions."
