    "intro": "Hemipteris, commonly known as the common spurge, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plants typically have milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation. Hemipteris species are often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and meadows. They play a role in supporting local insect populations and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
