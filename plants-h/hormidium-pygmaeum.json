    "intro": "Hormidium pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. The plant has a thalloid structure, consisting of a leaf-like body that is usually less than 1 centimeter in size. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes. Hormidium pygmaeum plays an important role in soil stabilization and as an indicator of environmental conditions."
