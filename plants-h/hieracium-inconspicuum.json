    "intro": "Hieracium inconspicuum, commonly known as the inconspicuous hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to parts of Europe and is characterized by its small, yellowish-orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy, and its stems are usually unbranched. Due to its modest appearance, it is often overlooked despite its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
