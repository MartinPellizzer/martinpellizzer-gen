It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering heads that produce yellow or orange disc flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and sunny exposures. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
