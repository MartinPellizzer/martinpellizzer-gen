    "intro": "Hemiphlebium sphenoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf winter creeper, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of whitish hairs. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are arranged in a distinctive, kidney-shaped pattern. It thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
