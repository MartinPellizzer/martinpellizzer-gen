    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. exotericoides, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its low-growing habit and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically forms dense mats on disturbed soils, often in meadows and along roadsides. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowering period occurs from late spring to early autumn. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature."
