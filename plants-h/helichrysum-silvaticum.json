It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and small, yellow to golden-orange flowers that resemble tiny suns. The plant produces bract-like leaves that are often mistaken for flowers, giving it a unique appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Helichrysum silvaticum is also noted for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
