It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces showy, purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and open fields. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed."
