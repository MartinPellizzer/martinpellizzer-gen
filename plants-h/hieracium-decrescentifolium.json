    "intro": "Hieracium decrescentifolium, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with numerous flowering stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, flat-topped clusters called capitula. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and gradually decrease in size as they ascend the stem. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which contribute to its distinctive appearance."
