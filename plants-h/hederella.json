    "intro": "Hederella, commonly known as the common ivy, is a climbing plant belonging to the Araliaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces dark blue to black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Hederella thrives in shaded environments and is often found climbing on walls, trees, and other structures. Its rapid growth and ability to spread make it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some regions."
