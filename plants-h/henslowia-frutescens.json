    "intro": "Henslowia frutescens, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compact, mounding growth habit and produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens. Henslowia frutescens is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
