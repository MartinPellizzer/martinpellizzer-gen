    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. repandifrons, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette growth habit and yellow composite flowers. The leaves are broadly ovate to lanceolate, with a rough, hairy texture, and the stems are usually reddish or purplish. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. This subspecies is often confused with other hawkweed species due to its similar appearance but can be distinguished by its leaf shape and flowering pattern."
