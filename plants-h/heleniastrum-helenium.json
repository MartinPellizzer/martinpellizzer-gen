    "intro": "Heleniastrum helenium, commonly known as the goldenrod, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to North America and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange inflorescences that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often hairy and somewhat woody at the base. Heleniastrum helenium plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
