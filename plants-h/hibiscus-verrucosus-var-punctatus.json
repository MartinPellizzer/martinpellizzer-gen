The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
