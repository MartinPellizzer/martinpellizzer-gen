It features large, umbrella-shaped inflorescences composed of numerous small white or greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has coarse, hairy leaves that are deeply lobed, often with a strong, unpleasant odor. Its stems are hollow and covered in coarse hairs, and they can grow up to 2 meters in height. It is often found in meadows, rocky areas, and along forest edges, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
