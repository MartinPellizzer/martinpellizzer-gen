    "intro": "Habenaria obtusata, commonly known as the blunt-leaf marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and Australia. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, preferring shaded environments with moist, well-drained soil. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, often with a faintly fragrant scent. Its leaves are broad and ovate, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The species is characterized by its specialized root system and mycorrhizal associations, which aid in nutrient uptake in its wetland environment."
