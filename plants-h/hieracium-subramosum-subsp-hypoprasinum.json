    "intro": "Hieracium subramosum subsp. hypoprasinum, commonly known as the greenleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and clustered in a flat-topped inflorescence. It is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
