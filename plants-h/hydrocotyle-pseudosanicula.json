    "intro": "Hydrocotyle pseudosanicula, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water shield, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. The plant has floating leaves that are divided into small, lobed segments, which help it capture sunlight for photosynthesis. Its roots are anchored in the substrate, and it produces small white flowers during the summer months. Hydrocotyle pseudosanicula plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
