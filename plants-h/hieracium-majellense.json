It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and ray florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are basal, rough, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat, disk-like cluster. Hieracium majellense is often found in mountainous areas, contributing to the biodiversity of alpine ecosystems."
