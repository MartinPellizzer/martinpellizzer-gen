    "intro": "Habenaria herbiola, commonly known as the lesser marsh helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia, Africa, and Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant features a sympodial growth habit with a short rhizome and a single, often reddish-brown stem. Its leaves are usually basal, linear, and slightly fleshy, adapted to retain moisture. The flowers are greenish-yellow with a distinctive hooded labellum, and they bloom during the spring or early summer."
