    "intro": "Hierophyllus cassena, commonly known as the sacred fern, is a striking plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, frond-like leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with dense clusters of spore-bearing structures called sorus on the underside of its leaves. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine and ceremonial practices due to its perceived spiritual significance. The botanical structure of Hierophyllus cassena reflects its adaptation to humid, shaded environments, making it a distinctive member of its family."
