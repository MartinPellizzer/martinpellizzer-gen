    "intro": "Hoya kentiana, commonly known as the \"Wax Plant\" or \"Lips of Buddha,\" is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy, waxy leaves that are often variegated with shades of white, green, and pink. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, appearing in late spring or early summer. Hoya kentiana thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
