    "intro": "Helichrysum maritimum, commonly known as the sea immortelle, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found in dunes and coastal cliffs. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that are tightly packed in dense, spherical clusters. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Helichrysum maritimum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
