    "intro": "Heliotropium ovalifolium var. gracile, commonly known as the slender heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of pink or purple flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed habitats. Its flowers emit a sweet, vanilla-like fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
