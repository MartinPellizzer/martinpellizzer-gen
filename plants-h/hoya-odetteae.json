    "intro": "Hoya odetteae, commonly known as the \"Crimson Queen,\" is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of fragrant, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces showy, pinkish-red blooms that are often borne on long, pendulous stems. Hoya odetteae is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in bright, indirect light. Its unique appearance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
