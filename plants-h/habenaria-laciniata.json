    "intro": "Habenaria laciniata, commonly known as the Slender Twayblade, is a perennial orchid native to parts of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. It has a complex root system and is often found in association with mycorrhizal fungi. Its morphology reflects adaptations to its specific ecological niche."
