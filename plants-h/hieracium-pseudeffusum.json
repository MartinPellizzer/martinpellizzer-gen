    "intro": "Hieracium pseudeffusum, commonly known as the false mouse-ear hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The species is considered an invasive weed in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
