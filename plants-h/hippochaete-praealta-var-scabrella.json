    "intro": "Hippochaete praealta var. scabrella, commonly known as the hairy antelope's foot, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, hairy, succulent leaves that store water, adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a dense, terminal cluster, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
