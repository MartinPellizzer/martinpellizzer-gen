    "intro": "Helianthemum strictum, commonly known as the upright stonecrop, is a low-growing evergreen perennial that belongs to the Crassulaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. It produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in dry, sunny environments."
