    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. cardiophyllum, commonly known as the heart-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grassy habitats, such as meadows and disturbed soils, and reaches heights of 20 to 60 centimeters. The plant has basal rosettes of leaves that are broadly heart-shaped, giving it its common name. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence and bloom from late spring to early summer. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, and it is often found in moist, calcareous soils."
