    "intro": "Hakea pedunculata, commonly known as the yellow hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding vibrant color to its habitat. The plant has woody stems and narrow, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It produces woody capsules that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Hakea pedunculata is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions."
