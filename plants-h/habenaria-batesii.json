    "intro": "Habenaria batesii, commonly known as the Bates' orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and striking, pale pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system and produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive lip. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and threatened species in its native range."
