    "intro": "Helichrysum pallasii, commonly known as the golden marguerite or Pallas's immortelle, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that remain vibrant even when dried, giving it its common name. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Helichrysum pallasii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
