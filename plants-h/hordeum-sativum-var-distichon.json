    "intro": "Hordeum sativum var. distichon, commonly known as two-row barley, is a cultivated variety of barley characterized by its two rows of grains per spikelet. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender, hollow stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence is a panicle, bearing small, two-rowed spikelets that contain the edible grains. This variety is widely used in agriculture for malting, brewing, and animal feed due to its high yield and adaptability."
