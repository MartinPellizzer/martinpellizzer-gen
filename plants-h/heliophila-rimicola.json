    "intro": "Heliophila rimicola, commonly known as the coastal heliophila, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant features slender, upright stems and small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. Heliophila rimicola plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
