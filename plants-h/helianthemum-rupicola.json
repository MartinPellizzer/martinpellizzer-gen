    "intro": "Helianthemum rupicola, commonly known as the rock heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in rocky and arid environments, often found on limestone soils. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in spring and early summer. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. Helianthemum rupicola is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
