    "intro": "Haplolobus hussonii, commonly known as the Husson's lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish thallus with a distinct, granular surface. The lichen typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in temperate forest environments. It is widely distributed across North America, particularly in the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for ecosystem health."
