    "intro": "Heliophila tenuifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf waterplantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along stream edges. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in early summer. Its root system helps stabilize soil and improve water quality in aquatic environments. Heliophila tenuifolia is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental potential in water gardens."
