    "intro": "Hieracium froelichianum subsp. macilentiforme, commonly known as the slender-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, with leaves that are narrow and linear. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, flat-topped clusters, typical of the genus Hieracium. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it distinguishable from other hawkweed species, particularly in its leaf morphology and flowering structure."
