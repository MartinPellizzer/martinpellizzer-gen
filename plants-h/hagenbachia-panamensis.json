    "intro": "Hagenbachia panamensis, commonly known as the Panamanian hagenbachia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Panama. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue-violet flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within humid lowland forests. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth texture, while its stems are woody and often branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hagenbachia panamensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
