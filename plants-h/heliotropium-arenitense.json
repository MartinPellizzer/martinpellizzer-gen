    "intro": "Heliotropium arenitense, commonly known as sand heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to hot, dry environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Heliotropium arenitense is often found in disturbed habitats and can be an indicator of coastal or desert ecosystems."
