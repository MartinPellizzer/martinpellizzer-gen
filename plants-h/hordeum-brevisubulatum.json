It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it is adapted to cold and arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Hordeum brevisubulatum is often found in association with other high-altitude flora, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
