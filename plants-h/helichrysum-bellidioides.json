    "intro": "Helichrysum bellidioides, commonly known as the Cape goldcup, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of bright yellow, sun-like flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. The flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the morning and closing by midday, a trait common in many members of the Asteraceae family."
