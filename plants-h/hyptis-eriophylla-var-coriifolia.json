    "intro": "Hyptis eriophylla var. coriifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf hyptis, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale blue, arranged in dense spikes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is cultivated in some regions for horticultural purposes."
