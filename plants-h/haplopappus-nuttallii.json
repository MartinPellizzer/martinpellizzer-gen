    "intro": "Haplopappus nuttallii, commonly known as Nuttall's hairpuff, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and unique inflorescence structure. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers that are clustered in a spherical shape, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are typically linear and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Haplopappus nuttallii is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in regions with low precipitation."
