    "intro": "Hieracium integrans, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disc. Hieracium integrans is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth habits."
