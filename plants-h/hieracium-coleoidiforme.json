    "intro": "Hieracium coleoidiforme, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features hairy, rough-textured leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense mats. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it can outcompete native flora and is sometimes considered a weed."
