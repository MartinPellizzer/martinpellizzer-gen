    "intro": "Haworthia flaccida, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves with white or yellow markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers on tall stems during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light. Haworthia flaccida is popular as a low-maintenance houseplant due to its unique appearance and ease of care."
