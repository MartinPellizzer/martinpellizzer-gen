    "intro": "Habenaria decaryana, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is an orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, hair-like inflorescence that often displays a striking pink or purple hue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in poor soils. The flowers are small and borne in a spiral arrangement, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
