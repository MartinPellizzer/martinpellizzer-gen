    "intro": "Hesperaloe campanulata, commonly known as the bell-shaped agave, is a striking succulent native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often lined with white teeth, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear numerous bell-shaped, white to pale purple flowers. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
