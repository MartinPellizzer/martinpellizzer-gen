    "intro": "Hieracium tristicolor, commonly known as the three-colored hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers are yellow with a central disc, and it produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium tristicolor is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature."
