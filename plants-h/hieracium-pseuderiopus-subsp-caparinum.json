    "intro": "Hieracium pseuderiopus subsp. caparinum, commonly known as the Caparina hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its rosette-forming basal leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded habitats. It has finely divided leaves and produces small, daisy-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
