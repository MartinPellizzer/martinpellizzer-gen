    "intro": "Hydrocotyle litoralis, commonly known as the salt marsh spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It thrives in brackish or saline environments, such as tidal flats and marshes, and is adapted to withstand periodic flooding and high salt concentrations. The plant has rounded, waxy leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its root system helps stabilize sediments, contributing to coastal erosion control. Hydrocotyle litoralis is an important component of intertidal ecosystems, supporting various invertebrates and birds."
