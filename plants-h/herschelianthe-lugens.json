    "intro": "Herschelianthe lugens, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and water-storing tissues. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Herschelianthe lugens plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
