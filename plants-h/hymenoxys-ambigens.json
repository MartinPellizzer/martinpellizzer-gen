    "intro": "Hymenoxys ambigens, commonly known as the ambiguous hymenoxys, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid to semi-arid environments. Its small, yellow to orange flowers bloom in the spring, and the plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits called cypsela. Hymenoxys ambigens is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and chaparral."
