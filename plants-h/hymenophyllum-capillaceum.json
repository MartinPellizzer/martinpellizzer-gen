    "intro": "Hymenophyllum capillaceum, commonly known as the slender hymenophyllum, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are densely packed and have a velvety texture, which helps retain moisture. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in small, clustered structures called sorus."
