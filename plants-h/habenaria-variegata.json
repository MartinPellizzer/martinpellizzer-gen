    "intro": "Habenaria variegata, commonly known as the variegated orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, often colorful flowers that come in shades of pink, white, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its leaves are usually broad and oval, with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. The orchid's inflorescence consists of a raceme of fragrant, showy blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
