    "intro": "Halopeplis gilliesii, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, waxy hairs, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Halopeplis gilliesii is adapted to arid and rocky environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
