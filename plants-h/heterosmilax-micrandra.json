    "intro": "Heterosmilax micrandra, commonly known as the Florida wild coffee, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, elliptic leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in hammocks and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
