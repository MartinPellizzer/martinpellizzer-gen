    "intro": "Hieracium nudicaule, commonly known as the naked-stem hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun. It has a slender, leafless stem that supports its yellowish flower heads, which consist of numerous small florets. Hieracium nudicaule is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
