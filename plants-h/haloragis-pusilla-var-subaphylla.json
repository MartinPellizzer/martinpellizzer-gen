    "intro": "Haloragis pusilla var. subaphylla, commonly known as the dwarf willow herb, is a small, herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, where it tolerates salt spray and wind exposure. The plant features tiny, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, and usually pink or red, blooming in late spring to early summer. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal invertebrates."
