It is characterized by its large, round clusters of white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its foliage turns vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall, adding seasonal interest. The plant is also valued for its ability to tolerate urban environments and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
