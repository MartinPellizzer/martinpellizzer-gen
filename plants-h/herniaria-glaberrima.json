    "intro": "Herniaria glaberrima, commonly known as the sand cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Herniaria glaberrima is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range."
