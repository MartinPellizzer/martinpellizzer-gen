It features soft, hairy stems and heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are typically covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers with a distinctive, narrow, tube-like corolla. It thrives in moist, wetland environments and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
