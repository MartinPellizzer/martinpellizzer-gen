    "intro": "Humbertianthus cardiostegius, commonly known as the heart-stemmed beauty, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant features a woody stem with a distinctive heart-shaped base, and its leaves are broad and ovate with a smooth, waxy surface. It produces vibrant pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Humbertianthus cardiostegius is considered a threatened species."
