    "intro": "Hieracium piliferum subsp. glanduliferum, commonly known as the glandular hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can reach heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are covered in glandular hairs, which give it a sticky texture and help in reducing water loss. The flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators."
