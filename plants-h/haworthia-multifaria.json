    "intro": "Haworthia multifaria, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or yellowish markings resembling a zebra's stripes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers on tall, slender stems during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its compact size and striking appearance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
