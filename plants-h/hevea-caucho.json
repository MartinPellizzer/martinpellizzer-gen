    "intro": "Hevea caucho, commonly known as rubber tree, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is renowned for producing natural rubber through the latex it secretes from its bark. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil. Its leaves are large, glossy, and arranged alternately along the stems. The latex is harvested by making incisions in the bark, allowing the milky sap to flow."
