    "intro": "Haplopappus spinulosus var. chihuahuanus, commonly known as the Chihuahuan hairycup, is a flowering plant native to the Chihuahuan Desert. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with silver-gray foliage and small, spiny stems. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found on rocky soils and slopes. Its adaptations include reduced leaf surface and deep root systems to conserve water and withstand harsh desert conditions."
