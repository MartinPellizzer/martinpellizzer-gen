    "intro": "Hedyotis ponapensis var. robusta, commonly known as the Ponap\u00e9 marsh herb, is a flowering plant native to the island of Pohnpei in the Caroline Islands. It is a low-growing herb with small, oval leaves that are typically arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest understories. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of the local flora and an indicator of wetland health."
