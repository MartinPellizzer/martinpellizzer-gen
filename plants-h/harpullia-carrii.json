    "intro": "Harpullia carrii, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a tropical evergreen tree native to northern Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Harpullia carrii plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing soil erosion. Its unique adaptations to saltwater environments make it a key component of mangrove forests."
