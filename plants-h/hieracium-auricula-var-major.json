It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
