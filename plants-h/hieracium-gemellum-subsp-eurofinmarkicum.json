    "intro": "Hieracium gemellum subsp. eurofinmarkicum, commonly known as the European meadow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, moist habitats such as meadows and grasslands across Europe. It is relatively small, with stems that are often reddish in color and covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and locally endemic species."
