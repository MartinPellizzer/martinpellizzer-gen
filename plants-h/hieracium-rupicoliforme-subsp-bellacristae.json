    "intro": "Hieracium rupicoliforme subsp. bellacristae, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. The plant features yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a single head, with ray florets that are often reddish or purplish in color. Its leaves are usually lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often found at high altitudes where competition from other plants is minimal."
