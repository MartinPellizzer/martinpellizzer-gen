    "intro": "Hypolepis rugosula subsp. lactea, commonly known as the veined shield fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds that are often covered with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round foliage and making it a popular ornamental plant in humid climates."
