    "intro": "Hieracium levicaule subsp. fissicladum, commonly known as the fissured leaf hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed or fissured, giving it its subspecific name. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a single terminal head, with ray florets that are usually shorter than the disk florets. This species is characterized by its robust growth and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
