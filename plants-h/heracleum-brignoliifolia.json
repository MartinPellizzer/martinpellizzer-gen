    "intro": "Heracleum brignoliifolia, commonly known as the Sicilian cow parsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbrella-shaped inflorescences and aromatic foliage. It is native to southern Europe, particularly Sicily, and thrives in moist, calcareous soils. The plant features large, pinnately divided leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length, and its flowers are typically white or pale green. It is often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
