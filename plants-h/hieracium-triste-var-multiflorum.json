    "intro": "Hieracium triste var. multiflorum, commonly known as the gloomy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, preferring temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped, rough to the touch, and often have a bluish-gray hue due to dense pubescence. The flowers are yellow and appear in clusters, contributing to its ornamental appeal despite its invasive tendencies in some regions."
