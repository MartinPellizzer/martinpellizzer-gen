    "intro": "Habenaria hyperborea, commonly known as the Arctic orchid, is a rare and cold-adapted species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in tundra or alpine habitats. Its survival depends on specific environmental conditions, including short growing seasons and low temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species."
