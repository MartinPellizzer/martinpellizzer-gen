    "intro": "Holandrea pschawica, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a distinctive star-shaped pattern, which are highly attractive to pollinators. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are long and narrow, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The botanical features of Holandrea pschawica make it a popular choice for both horticultural collections and botanical research."
