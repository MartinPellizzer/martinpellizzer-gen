It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk.
