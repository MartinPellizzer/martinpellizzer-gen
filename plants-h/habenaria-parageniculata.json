    "intro": "Habenaria parageniculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Korean Peninsula. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands, where it thrives in the presence of mycorrhizal fungi. The plant features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, narrow spur. Its root system is adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
