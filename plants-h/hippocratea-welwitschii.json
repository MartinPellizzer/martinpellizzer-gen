    "intro": "Hippocratea welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia tree, is a unique plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia and Angola. It is one of the oldest known seed plants, with a lineage dating back over 140 million years. The plant features a thick, woody trunk and a crown of dark green, leathery leaves that help it conserve water in its arid environment. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers and has a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi that aid in nutrient absorption. Its slow growth and longevity make it a rare and ecologically significant species in its habitat."
