    "intro": "Heterodendrum oleifolium var. microcalyx, commonly known as the small-fruited oleifolium, is a rare and lesser-known plant species within the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is adapted to grow in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands or rocky slopes."
