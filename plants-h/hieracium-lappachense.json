It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils at high elevations. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium lappachense is known for its ability to form dense colonies, often acting as a pioneer species in disturbed or barren environments."
