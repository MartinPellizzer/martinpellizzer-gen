    "intro": "Hakea rubricaulis, commonly known as the red-stemmed hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive red or pinkish stems, which are covered in a fine, woolly layer. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical spikes, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Hakea rubricaulis is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy plant in coastal and inland regions."
