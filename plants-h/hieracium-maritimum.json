It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant features alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence and bloom from June to September. Hieracium maritimum is adapted to salt-laden environments and plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils."
