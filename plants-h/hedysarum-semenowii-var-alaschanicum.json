    "intro": "Hedysarum semenowii var. alaschanicum, commonly known as the Alaskan milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features slender, branching stems that often grow along the ground, with trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-pink flowers arranged in dense, elongated clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and capable of fixing nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility. This species is adapted to rocky and dry environments, making it a hardy plant in alpine and subalpine habitats."
