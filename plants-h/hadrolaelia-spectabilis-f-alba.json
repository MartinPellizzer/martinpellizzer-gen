    "intro": "Hadrolaelia spectabilis f. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered orchid, is a rare and striking botanical specimen native to the high altitudes of the Andes. This alpine orchid features showy, white blooms that contrast sharply with its dark green foliage. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is typically found in rocky, well-drained habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces fragrant, long-lasting flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species."
