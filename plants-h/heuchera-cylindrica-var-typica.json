    "intro": "Heuchera cylindrica var. typica, commonly known as the smoothleaf alumroot, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth, waxy texture and a deep green to reddish bronze coloration. The plant produces upright, cylindrical flower spikes in early spring, bearing small, pale green to white flowers. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage, which often displays striking color variations throughout the growing season."
