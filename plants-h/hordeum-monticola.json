    "intro": "Hordeum monticola, commonly known as mountain barley, is a wild grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it tolerates cold temperatures and poor soil conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough, hairy texture. Hordeum monticola plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to harsh climates."
