    "intro": "Hieracium schliakovii, commonly known as Schliakov's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as steppes and rocky soils. It has small, hairy leaves and produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
