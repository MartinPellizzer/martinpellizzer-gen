It features compact, rounded foliage with small, waxy leaves that are typically green to grayish in color. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
