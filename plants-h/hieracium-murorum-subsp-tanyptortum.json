    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. tanyptortum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are often hairy and have a rough texture. Its flowering stems bear yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and it produces small, oval-shaped achenes as its seeds. This subspecies is characterized by its smaller, more compact growth compared to other members of the Hieracium genus."
