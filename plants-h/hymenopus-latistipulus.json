    "intro": "Hymenopus latistipulus, commonly known as the broad-tipped hymenopus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its showy, pink to purple bracts that resemble petals, which serve to attract pollinators. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The flowers are small and clustered, with stamens that are often more prominent than the pistils."
