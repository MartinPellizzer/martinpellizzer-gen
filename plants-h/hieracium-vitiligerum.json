It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers consist of yellow ray florets surrounding a white disk. Hieracium vitiligerum is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in agricultural areas."
