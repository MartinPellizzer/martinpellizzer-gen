    "intro": "Hippeastrum angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved amaryllis, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its narrow, strap-like leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, pink, and white. The plant produces large, fleshy bulbs that store nutrients, supporting its growth during periods of dormancy. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Hippeastrum angustifolium is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can be grown both indoors and outdoors in suitable climates."
