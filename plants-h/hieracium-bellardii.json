    "intro": "Hieracium bellardii, commonly known as Bellard's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. Bellard's hawkweed is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
