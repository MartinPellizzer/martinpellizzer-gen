    "intro": "Hohenbergia gnetacea, commonly known as the silver-veined hohenbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically silver or gray-green in color, with prominent white veins. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences that bear showy, pinkish-white flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hohenbergia gnetacea is popular as a houseplant due to its elegant appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
