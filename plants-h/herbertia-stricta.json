    "intro": "Herbertia stricta, commonly known as the rigid herbertia, is a perennial herb native to South America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces striking, spike-like inflorescences with showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense clumps over time."
