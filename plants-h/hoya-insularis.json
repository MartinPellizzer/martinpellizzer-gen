    "intro": "Hoya insularis, commonly known as the Island Wanda, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features thick, fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped, waxy flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hoya insularis is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
