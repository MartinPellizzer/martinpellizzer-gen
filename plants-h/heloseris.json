    "intro": "Heloseris, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nychthemeral. These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers that open during the day and close at night. Heloseris species typically thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Their roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of water bodies, while their leaves float on the surface. The flowers of Heloseris play an important role in attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
