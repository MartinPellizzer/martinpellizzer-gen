    "intro": "Hebeclinium vitifolium, commonly known as the grape-leaved hebeclinium, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features lance-shaped, glossy leaves that resemble grape leaves, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
