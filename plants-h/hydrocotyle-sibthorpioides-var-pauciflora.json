    "intro": "Hydrocotyle sibthorpioides var. pauciflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water shield, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It features a rosette of heart-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, typically emerging from the water. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the sediment in aquatic environments. It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands."
