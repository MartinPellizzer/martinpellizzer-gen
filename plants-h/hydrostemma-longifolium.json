    "intro": "Hydrostemma longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved hydrostemma, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in temperate regions. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, adorned with lance-shaped, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from waterlogged soils. Hydrostemma longifolium is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along slow-moving streams."
