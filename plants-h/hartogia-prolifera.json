    "intro": "Hartogia prolifera, commonly known as the coastal sandplain lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga. It thrives in arid, coastal environments, particularly on sandstone and granite substrates. The plant forms a crust-like structure that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low moisture conditions. Hartogia prolifera plays a crucial role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing microhabitats for other organisms."
