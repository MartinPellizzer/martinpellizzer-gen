    "intro": "Hibiscus simplex, commonly known as the narrowleaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its simple, lance-shaped leaves and showy, single-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in wetland environments and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It blooms from late summer to early fall, producing flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hibiscus simplex is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
