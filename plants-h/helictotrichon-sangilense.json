    "intro": "Helictotrichon sangilense, commonly known as the Sangilense needlegrass, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapting to its harsh, arid environment. Helictotrichon sangilense plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
