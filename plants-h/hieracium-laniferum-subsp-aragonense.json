    "intro": "Hieracium laniferum subsp. aragonense, commonly known as the Aragon hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Italy. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has basal and stem leaves that are hairy and lance-shaped, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
