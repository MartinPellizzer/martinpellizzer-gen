    "intro": "Helianthemum microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved sunflower plant, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub with compact, evergreen foliage and produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardening."
