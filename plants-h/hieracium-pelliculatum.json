    "intro": "Hieracium pelliculatum, commonly known as the silky hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers with ray florets. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
