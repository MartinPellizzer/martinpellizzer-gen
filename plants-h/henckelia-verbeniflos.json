It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in whorled clusters along the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in warm climates."
