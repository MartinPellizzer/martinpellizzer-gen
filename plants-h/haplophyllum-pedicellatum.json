    "intro": "Haplophyllum pedicellatum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the Arabian Peninsula and parts of the Middle East. It belongs to the family Olacaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant is known for its aromatic wood, which has been historically valued for its use in incense and as a decorative material. Haplophyllum pedicellatum thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and coastal areas. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered and is protected in several regions."
