    "intro": "Halopegia, commonly known as the African snowflake, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or subshrubs with succulent, often hairy leaves. The flowers are typically small and clustered, often in dense inflorescences, and are usually white or pale blue in color. These plants are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing a variety of drought-resistant features. They are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky or sandy soils."
