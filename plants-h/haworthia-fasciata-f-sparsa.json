    "intro": "Haworthia fasciata f. sparsa, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to South Africa. It features striking, zebra-like markings on its fleshy, blue-green leaves, which are often speckled with white or yellow spots. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers on tall, slender stems during the warmer months. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor and rock garden settings."
