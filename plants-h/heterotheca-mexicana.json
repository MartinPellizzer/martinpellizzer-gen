It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. The flowers bloom in late summer to early fall, producing showy purple to pink inflorescences that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
