    "intro": "Helichrysum alticola, commonly known as the alpine everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces yellowish to golden flowers that are often arranged in dense, spherical clusters. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Helichrysum alticola is well adapted to high altitudes and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
