    "intro": "Holcus notarisii, commonly known as the notarisii grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native habitats."
