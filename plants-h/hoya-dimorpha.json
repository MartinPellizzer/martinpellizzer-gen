    "intro": "Hoya dimorpha, commonly known as the \"Wax Plant\" or \"Porcelana,\" is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Hoya dimorpha is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without being parasitic. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
