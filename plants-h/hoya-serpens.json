    "intro": "Hoya serpens, commonly known as the serpent hoya, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and waxy, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Hoya serpens thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for hanging baskets due to its ability to cascade gracefully."
