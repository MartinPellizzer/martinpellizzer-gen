    "intro": "Hydrocharis laevigata, commonly known as the smooth water shield, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. The plant has floating leaves that are oval-shaped and smooth, with a waxy surface. Its small, yellow flowers bloom above the water surface, often in clusters. Hydrocharis laevigata plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic organisms."
