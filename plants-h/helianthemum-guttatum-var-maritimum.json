    "intro": "Helianthemum guttatum var. maritimum, commonly known as the coastal carnation, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western Mediterranean. It features dense clusters of bright pink or red flowers that bloom in spring and summer. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, helping it retain moisture in its arid coastal habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact size and vibrant flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
