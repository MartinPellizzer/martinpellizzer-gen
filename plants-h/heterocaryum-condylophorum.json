    "intro": "Heterocaryum condylophorum, commonly known as the African waterwheel, is a perennial aquatic plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of leaves that radiate from a central stem, giving it a wheel-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow water, such as ponds and wetlands, and is often found in still or slow-moving water bodies. Its leaves are narrow, strap-shaped, and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. Heterocaryum condylophorum plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
