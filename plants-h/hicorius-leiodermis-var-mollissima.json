    "intro": "Hicorius leiodermis var. mollissima, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by winged fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful forage plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
