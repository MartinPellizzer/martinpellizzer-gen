    "intro": "Hieracium tholerotrichum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers. Native to Europe, it is often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. The plant's hairy stems and leaves help it retain moisture and reduce water loss. It is considered a weed in some regions due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
