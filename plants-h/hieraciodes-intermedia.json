It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other mustard plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or arctic regions. It produces small, white or yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, lobed, and covered in fine hairs, which help it retain moisture in harsh environments."
