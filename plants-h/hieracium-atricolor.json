    "intro": "Hieracium atricolor, commonly known as the black hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and clusters of small, dark violet to black flowers. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides. It produces achenes, which are small, dry fruits that disperse seeds via the wind. The plant is often considered a weed but has historical uses in herbal medicine."
