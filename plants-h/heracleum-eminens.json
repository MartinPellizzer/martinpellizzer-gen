    "intro": "Heracleum eminens, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It can grow up to 5 meters in height, featuring large, umbrella-like compound leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and sap that contains phototoxic compounds, which can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. It is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as riverbanks and roadsides. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is considered a noxious weed in parts of North America."
