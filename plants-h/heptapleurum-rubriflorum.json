    "intro": "Heptapleurum rubriflorum, commonly known as the red-flowered heptapleurum, is a species of evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, depending on the variety. These flowers are followed by small, spherical berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
