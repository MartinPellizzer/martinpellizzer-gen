    "intro": "Hypericum chrysothyrsum, commonly known as the golden-stemmed St. John's wort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and woody, branched stems that are often covered in small, yellowish glands. The plant typically grows in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky areas. It blooms from June to August, producing clusters of five-petaled flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are opposite, simple, and oval-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface."
