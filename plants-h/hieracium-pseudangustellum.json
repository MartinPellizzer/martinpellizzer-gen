    "intro": "Hieracium pseudangustellum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture, and its flowers are yellow with a central disk. It is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature."
