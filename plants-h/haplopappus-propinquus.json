    "intro": "Haplopappus propinquus, commonly known as the plains burrweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its small, rough, and prickly seeds are adapted for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread across arid environments. Haplopappus propinquus is often found in regions with low precipitation and is well-suited to thrive in harsh, semi-desert conditions."
