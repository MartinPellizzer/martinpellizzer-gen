It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its berries are bright red and edible, though they are often consumed by birds. Hedera floribunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
