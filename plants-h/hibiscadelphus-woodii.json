    "intro": "Hibiscadelphus woodii, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 Hibiscus, is a rare and critically endangered plant native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in shades of red and yellow. The plant thrives in the unique microclimate of the Haleakal\u0101 National Park, where it grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. Due to habitat loss and introduced species, it faces significant conservation challenges, making it a focal point for ecological preservation efforts. Its limited distribution and low genetic diversity further underscore its vulnerability to environmental changes."
