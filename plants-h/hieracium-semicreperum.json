It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites.

The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
