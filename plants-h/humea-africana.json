    "intro": "Humea africana, commonly known as the African huckleberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southern regions of Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant flowers. Humea africana is well adapted to acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain."
