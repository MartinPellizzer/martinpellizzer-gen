    "intro": "Hieracium brevifolium subsp. caruelii, commonly known as the Caruel's short-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and sunny exposures. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters at the end of its stems. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in rocky or grassy slopes. This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and is relatively uncommon, making it a notable species in its native range."
