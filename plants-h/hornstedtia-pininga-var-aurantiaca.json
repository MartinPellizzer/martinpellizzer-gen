    "intro": "Hornstedtia pininga var. aurantiaca, commonly known as the golden hornstedtia, is a variant of the hornstedtia pininga species, characterized by its striking orange to yellow foliage. This plant is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and display a vibrant coloration that intensifies with sunlight exposure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white, which are not the primary ornamental feature. It is valued in horticulture for its unique foliage color and adaptability to container gardening."
