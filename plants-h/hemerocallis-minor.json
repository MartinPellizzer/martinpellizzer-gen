    "intro": "Hemerocallis minor, commonly known as the dwarf daylily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant blooms in late spring to early summer, with each flower lasting only one day, hence its common name. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Hemerocallis minor is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ease of care in gardens."
