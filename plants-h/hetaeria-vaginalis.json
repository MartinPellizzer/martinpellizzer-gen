    "intro": "Hetaeria vaginalis, commonly known as the common hetaeria, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Hetaeria vaginalis is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It has adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it a resilient species in its native range."
