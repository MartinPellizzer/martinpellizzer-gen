    "intro": "Hypericum tomentosum var. palustre, commonly known as swamp St. John's wort, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features prostrate stems covered in dense, woolly white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers with prominent yellow stamens, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are oval to ovate, with a slightly toothed margin and a soft, hairy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along stream banks."
