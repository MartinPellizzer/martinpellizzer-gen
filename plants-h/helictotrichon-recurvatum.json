    "intro": "Helictotrichon recurvatum, commonly known as the curly hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves that often curl at the tips, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Helictotrichon recurvatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
