    "intro": "Hevea huberiana, commonly known as the Huber's rubber tree, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. This plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green in color. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in catkins, and its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. The tree is known for its latex-producing properties, though it is not as commercially significant as Hevea brasiliensis. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts."
