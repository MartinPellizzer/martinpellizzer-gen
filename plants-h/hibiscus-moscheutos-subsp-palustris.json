It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically blooming in summer. The plant has heart-shaped, broad leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist to wet soil and full sun to partial shade. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it useful in wetland restoration projects."
