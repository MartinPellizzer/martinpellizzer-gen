    "intro": "Hopea, commonly known as the \"silk-cotton tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Dipterocarpaceae. These trees are native to Southeast Asia and are characterized by their large, showy, cotton-like seeds that are often used in traditional medicine. Hopea species typically have smooth, grayish bark and can grow to impressive heights, sometimes reaching over 50 meters. Their leaves are usually alternate, simple, and elliptical in shape, with a glossy surface. The genus includes several species, some of which are valued for their hard, durable wood used in construction and furniture-making."
