    "intro": "Haworthia \u00d7 pseudorigida, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a hybrid succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically green with white or yellowish markings resembling a zebra's stripes. The plant is a hybrid between Haworthia fasciata and Haworthia attenuata, resulting in unique variegation patterns. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or indoor cultivation. Due to its striking appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
