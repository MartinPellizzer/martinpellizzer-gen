    "intro": "Haworthia cooperi var. truncata, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to South Africa. It features striking, fleshy leaves with white to yellowish markings that resemble a zebra's stripes, giving it its common name. The plant has a slow growth rate and is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance for low light and minimal water requirements. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers on slender stems during the warmer months. The leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water, making it drought-tolerant and ideal for rock gardens or container planting."
