It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and the leaves are usually alternate, with a rough or hairy texture. It is an herbaceous perennial that can spread through rhizomes, forming dense mats in suitable environments."
