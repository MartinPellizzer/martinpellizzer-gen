    "intro": "Hieracium orphnolepium, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and the leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. It is often considered a weed due to its aggressive spreading habit through rhizomes and seeds."
