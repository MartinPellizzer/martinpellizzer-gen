    "intro": "Huperzia goudotii, commonly known as the Goudot's clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features whorled leaves that form dense, compact clusters, and it produces sporangia on specialized structures called strobila. Huperzia goudotii is characterized by its primitive structure, with no true roots, stems, or leaves in the traditional sense. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
