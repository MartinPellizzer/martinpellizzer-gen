    "intro": "Holcus laxus, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, creeping stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in spikelets, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Holcus laxus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
