    "intro": "Hieracium euryphyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, pastures, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features rosettes of basal leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a hairy surface. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium euryphyllum is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, making it a common sight in temperate regions."
