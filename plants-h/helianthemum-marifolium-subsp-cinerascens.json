    "intro": "Helianthemum marifolium subsp. cinerascens, commonly known as the silverleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The leaves are characterized by their silvery-gray color due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in garden settings."
