    "intro": "Hymenidium giraldii, commonly known as the Giraldi's shield fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, shield-shaped fronds that are densely covered with tiny, scale-like structures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Hymenidium giraldii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
