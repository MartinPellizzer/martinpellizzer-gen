    "intro": "Heterostemon mazarunensis, commonly known as the Mazarunensis starflower, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically blue or purple in color, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
