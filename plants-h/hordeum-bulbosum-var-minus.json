    "intro": "Hordeum bulbosum var. minus, commonly known as the dwarf barley, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, cylindrical seed heads. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a fibrous root system. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. This variety is less commonly cultivated than other barley species but is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
