    "intro": "Hieracium trichosoma, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosette of leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typical of the daisy family, and is often found in meadows and disturbed soils. It has a fibrous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively through rhizomes. Hieracium trichosoma is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit."
