    "intro": "Hieracium kerneri subsp. raccolanae, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy stems. The subspecies raccolanae is distinguished by its compact growth habit and smaller flower heads compared to the typical form of H. kerneri. It thrives in rocky and open habitats at high altitudes, where it is adapted to cold and harsh environmental conditions. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine environments and supports local pollinators."
