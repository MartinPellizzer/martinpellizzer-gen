    "intro": "Hippocrepis comosa proles prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate helmet orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing, prostrate habit, with slender stems that lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, helmet-shaped flowers that are typically pale green or yellowish in color. It thrives in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
