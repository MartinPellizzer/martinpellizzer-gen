It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, yellowish to greenish composite flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its reduced leaf size and a more compact growth habit compared to other members of the species. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptation and ecological distribution."
