    "intro": "Hieracium incaniceps, commonly known as the silverleaf hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are broadly lance-shaped with a silvery or whitish underside, giving it its common name. The flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, producing small seeds that are dispersed by wind."
