    "intro": "Hainania trichosperma, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. The plant has small, green, ovate leaves and produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that contains seeds covered in a white, silky coating. Hainania trichosperma is often used in traditional medicine, though its toxic properties require caution in handling."
