It is a herbaceous perennial with hairy stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces bright yellow composite flowers with a distinctive central disk surrounded by ray florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid landscapes."
