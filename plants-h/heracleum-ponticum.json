    "intro": "Heracleum ponticum, commonly known as the Caucasian cowparsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences. It is a biennial or perennial herb that can grow up to 2 meters tall, with hollow, ridged stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters, which are followed by small, dry fruits. It is native to the Caucasus region and is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open woodlands. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed."
