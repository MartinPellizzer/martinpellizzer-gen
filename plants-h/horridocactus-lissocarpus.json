    "intro": "Horridocactus lissocarpus, commonly known as the smooth-fruited cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a vibrant touch to its arid habitat. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to dry conditions. Horridocactus lissocarpus is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and resilience in harsh environments."
