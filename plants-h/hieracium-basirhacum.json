It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, producing small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium basirhacum is often found in meadows and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
