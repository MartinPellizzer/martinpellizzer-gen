    "intro": "Heliocarpus glandulifer, commonly known as the rough sycamore, is a tropical tree native to South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, helmet-shaped fruits. Its seeds are enclosed in a hard, spiky capsule that opens to release the seeds. Heliocarpus glandulifer is often found in moist, lowland forests and is valued for its hard, durable wood."
