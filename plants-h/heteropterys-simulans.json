    "intro": "Heteropterys simulans, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is often found in humid, tropical environments and thrives in well-drained soil. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
