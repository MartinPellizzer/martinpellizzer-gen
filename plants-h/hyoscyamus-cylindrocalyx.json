    "intro": "Hyoscyamus cylindrocalyx, commonly known as the narrow-calyx henbane, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, globose berries that contain toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a weed in agricultural areas and requires careful handling."
