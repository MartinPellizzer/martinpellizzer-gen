    "intro": "Heliconia villosa var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy heliconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, brightly colored, spiral-shaped inflorescences that resemble a hand clutching a bunch of flowers. The plant has broad, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. The flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure and vibrant colors."
