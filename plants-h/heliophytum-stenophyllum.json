    "intro": "Heliophytum stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sunplant, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It features compact, rounded growth with fleshy, narrow leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are covered in a fine, powdery coating that helps reduce water loss and reflects sunlight. Heliophytum stenophyllum is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
