It is a perennial herb characterized by its hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. Its small size and distinctive appearance make it a common weed in agricultural and garden settings."
