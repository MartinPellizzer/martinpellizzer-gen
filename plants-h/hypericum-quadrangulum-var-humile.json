    "intro": "Hypericum quadrangulum var. humile, commonly known as the dwarf St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant has four-sided, woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its medicinal properties, similar to other Hypericum species, have been historically used in herbal remedies."
