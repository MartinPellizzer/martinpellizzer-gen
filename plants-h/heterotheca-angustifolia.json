    "intro": "Heterotheca angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, blue to purple flowers from late spring to early summer. Heterotheca angustifolia is often found in arid and semi-arid regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinators."
