    "intro": "Heliconia monteverdensis var. vulcanicola, commonly known as the Volcanic Heliconia, is a striking tropical plant native to the volcanic regions of Central America. It is characterized by its large, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves used to attract pollinators. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests near volcanic soil. Its inflorescence consists of numerous small, fragrant flowers clustered within the bracts. This variety is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
