It is characterized by its yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer, and its distinctive, slightly hairy leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has woody stems that become more prominent with age. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, while its flowers are arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. Hypericum heldreichii is often found in rocky or limestone-rich soils, thriving in sunny, well-drained environments."
