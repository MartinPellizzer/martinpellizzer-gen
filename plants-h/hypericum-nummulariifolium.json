    "intro": "Hypericum nummulariifolium, commonly known as the pennywort or golden shield, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has rounded, shield-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white powdery coating called a bloom. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for garden use in shady gardens."
