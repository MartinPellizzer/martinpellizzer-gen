    "intro": "Helichrysum alveolatum, commonly known as the honeycomb bush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, rounded clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that resemble honeycombs, giving it its common name. The plant has narrow, silver-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Helichrysum alveolatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
