    "intro": "Haworthia pilosa, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in white tubercles, giving it a distinctive zebra-like appearance. The leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. It produces small, white or pale green flowers on tall, slender stems during the warmer months. This plant prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
