    "intro": "Hieracium plicatum subsp. amitsokense, commonly known as the Amitsokense hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It has small, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and produces numerous small seeds dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
