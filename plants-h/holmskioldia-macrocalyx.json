    "intro": "Holmskioldia macrocalyx, commonly known as the giant flame flower, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow-orange bracts that resemble petals, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by elongated, spiny seed pods. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
