    "intro": "Haworthia viscosa var. torquata, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves that are often marked with distinct white or yellow markings resembling a zebra's stripes. The leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to store water, allowing the plant to thrive in arid conditions. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or yellow during the warmer months. This species is popular among succulent enthusiasts for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
