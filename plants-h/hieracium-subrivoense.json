    "intro": "Hieracium subrivoense, commonly known as the subrivoese hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and produces showy yellow flowers in summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. It has a creeping growth habit with stolons that allow it to spread across the ground. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare species in certain regions of Europe."
