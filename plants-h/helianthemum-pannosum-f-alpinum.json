    "intro": "Helianthemum pannosum f. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the high alpine regions of Europe. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has compact, fleshy leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in the dry, rocky environments it inhabits. It thrives in full sun and is often found on slopes and meadows at high elevations. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for harsh mountain climates and it is often used in rock gardens."
