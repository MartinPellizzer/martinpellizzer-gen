It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are yellow with a central disc. Hieracium variiceps is known for its variability in leaf shape and flower structure, which contributes to its common name."
