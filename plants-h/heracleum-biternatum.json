    "intro": "Heracleum biternatum, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, umbrella-shaped flowers and is characterized by its thick, hairy stems and large, lobed leaves. The plant contains phototoxic sap that can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. It is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as stream banks and roadsides. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
