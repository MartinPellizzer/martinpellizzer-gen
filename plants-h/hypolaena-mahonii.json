    "intro": "Hypolaena mahonii, commonly known as the Mahon's hypolaena, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to the island of Mah\u00e9 in the Seychelles and is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the tropical rainforest canopy. Its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a rosette, which helps collect moisture from the humid environment. Hypolaena mahonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
