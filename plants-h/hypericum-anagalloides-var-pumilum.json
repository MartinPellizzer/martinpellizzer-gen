It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, red-orange berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a suitable plant for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
