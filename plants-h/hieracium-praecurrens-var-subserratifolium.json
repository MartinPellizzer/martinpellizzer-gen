It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and leafy stems. The plant features basal rosettes of leaves that are typically serrated along the margins, giving it its specific epithet. Its flowering stems rise above the rosettes, bearing yellow ray flowers surrounded by tubular florets. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, often forming dense colonies."
