    "intro": "Hakea pugioniformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for low-water gardens. The bark of Hakea pugioniformis is typically grey or reddish-brown and peels in thin, fibrous strips."
