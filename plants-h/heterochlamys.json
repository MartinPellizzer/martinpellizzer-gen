    "intro": "Heterochlamys, commonly known as the \"star-shaped\" or \"chalice-shaped\" flower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique floral structure, which features a specialized calyx that resembles a chalice or cup. The flowers typically have five to seven petals that are unequal in size, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. Heterochlamys species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa and South America. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their striking and unusual floral morphology."
