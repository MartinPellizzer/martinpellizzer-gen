It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Heteromorpha stenophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
