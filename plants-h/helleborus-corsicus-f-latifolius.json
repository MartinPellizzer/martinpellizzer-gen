    "intro": "Helleborus corsicus f. latifolius, commonly known as the Corsican hellebore, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the island of Corsica. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces showy, dark purple to black flowers with a waxy appearance, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
