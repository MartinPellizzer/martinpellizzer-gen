    "intro": "Hosta montana var. praeflorens, commonly known as the Mountain Hosta, is a hardy perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a silvery-white margin. The plant produces upright, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale blue, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for shady garden settings. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its modest but elegant flowers."
