    "intro": "Holothrix squamulosa, commonly known as the velvet moss, is a unique plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a non-vascular plant, meaning it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its entire surface. This species is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its structure consists of dense clusters of tiny, scale-like leaves that give it a velvety appearance. Holothrix squamulosa plays an important ecological role by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms."
