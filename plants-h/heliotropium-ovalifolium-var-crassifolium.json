    "intro": "Heliotropium ovalifolium var. crassifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are oval in shape and often have a bluish-gray hue. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
