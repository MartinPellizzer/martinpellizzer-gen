    "intro": "Hemionitis keralensis, commonly known as Keralan hemionitis, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a small, terrestrial herb belonging to the family Hemionitidaceae, characterized by its rosette-like growth habit. The plant features delicate, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its humid, shaded habitat. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, Hemionitis keralensis is under threat and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
