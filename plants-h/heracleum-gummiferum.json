    "intro": "Heracleum gummiferum, commonly known as the gummed hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems that are often covered with fine hairs and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces large, umbrella-shaped inflorescences with small white or greenish flowers, which attract various pollinators. Its leaves are deeply lobed and can be quite large, often with a distinctive silvery or whitish underside. The plant contains phototoxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to skin when exposed to sunlight."
