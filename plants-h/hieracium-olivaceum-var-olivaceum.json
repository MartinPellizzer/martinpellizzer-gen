    "intro": "Hieracium olivaceum var. olivaceum, commonly known as the olive hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences. Its flowers consist of a central disc surrounded by ray florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry environments."
