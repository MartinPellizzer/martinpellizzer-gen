    "intro": "Hericinia arvensis, commonly known as the field horned lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form and a yellowish to brownish thallus with distinct, horn-like lobes. The lichen typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in temperate regions, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its chemical composition includes various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization. Hericinia arvensis is also used in ecological studies to assess air quality and environmental changes due to its sensitivity to pollutants."
