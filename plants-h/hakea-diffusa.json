    "intro": "Hakea diffusa, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in woody follicles that open to release the seeds when dry. Hakea diffusa is often found in coastal heathlands and sandy soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local wildlife."
