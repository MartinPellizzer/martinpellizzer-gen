    "intro": "Haworthia decipiens var. xiphiophylla, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features striking, narrow, white to yellowish stripes on its fleshy, dark green leaves, which give it a distinctive zebra-like appearance. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers on slender stems during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to maintain its vibrant appearance. Due to its compact size and unique foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and rock gardens."
