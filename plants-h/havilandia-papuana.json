    "intro": "Havilandia papuana, commonly known as the Papuan bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of New Guinea. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats at elevations above 1,500 meters. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
