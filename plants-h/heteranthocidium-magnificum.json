    "intro": "Heteranthocidium magnificum, commonly known as the celestial bloom, is a rare flowering plant characterized by its striking, iridescent petals that shift color under different light conditions. Native to the misty highlands of the Andes, it thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil. The plant features a compact, bushy growth habit with multiple stems that bear clusters of small, fragrant flowers. Its unique botanical traits include a complex floral structure with both showy and functional petals, and it produces nectar-rich blooms that attract a variety of pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation priority."
