    "intro": "Helichrysum sinclairii, commonly known as the golden marguerite or everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that retain their color even after drying. The plant features narrow, silver-green leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to retain color makes it a favored ingredient in floral arrangements and natural dyes."
