    "intro": "Herpestis stricta var. elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to certain regions of Europe. It possesses slender, upright stems that are often covered in small, bladder-like structures used to trap aquatic invertebrates. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies, where it relies on its specialized adaptations to obtain nutrients. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters near the water's surface. This variant is closely related to other species in the genus Herpestis, sharing similar morphological and ecological traits."
