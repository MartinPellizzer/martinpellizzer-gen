    "intro": "Hakea oldei, commonly known as Old's hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical or cylindrical-branching stems and its distinctive, often prickly foliage. The plant produces striking, bottle-shaped or urn-like flowers that are typically red or orange in color. These flowers are adapted for pollination by nectar-feeding birds, particularly honeyeaters. Hakea oldei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
