    "intro": "Heracleum tragoides, commonly known as the common cowparsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. It is a biennial herb that can grow up to 2 meters tall, with large, heart-shaped basal leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, which are followed by small, dry fruits called schizocarps. Its leaves and stems contain compounds that can cause skin irritation, making it a plant to handle with care. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often becoming a weed in disturbed soils."
