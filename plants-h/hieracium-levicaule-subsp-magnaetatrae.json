    "intro": "Hieracium levicaule subsp. magnaetatrae, commonly known as the giant hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broadly lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture, and are often lobed at the base. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, and it thrives in full sun, making it a distinctive feature of alpine meadows."
