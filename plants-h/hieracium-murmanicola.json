    "intro": "Hieracium murmanicola, commonly known as the Murman hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Hieracium murmanicola plays a role in stabilizing soil in these harsh environments and is an important part of the local flora."
