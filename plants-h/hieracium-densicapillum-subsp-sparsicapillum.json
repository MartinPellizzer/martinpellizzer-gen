    "intro": "Hieracium densicapillum subsp. sparsicapillum, commonly known as the sparse-haired hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow flower heads. The subspecies is distinguished by its sparse, short hairs on the stem and leaves, giving it a more delicate appearance compared to other hawkweed species. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, composite flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
