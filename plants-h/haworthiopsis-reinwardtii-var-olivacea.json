    "intro": "Haworthiopsis reinwardtii var. olivacea, commonly known as the Olive Haworthia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features dense rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and a pale green or olive-colored hue. The leaves are typically adorned with white or pale green markings, giving it a striking appearance. It produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers on tall, slender stems during the warmer months. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its drought tolerance and minimal care requirements."
