    "intro": "Habenaria spencei, commonly known as the Spence's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose spike, often with a distinct lip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
