    "intro": "Hierochloe ochotensis, commonly known as Siberian bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern regions of Russia. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and forms dense, low-growing mats. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its flowering stems are usually short and bear small, spike-like inflorescences. Hierochloe ochotensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine and arctic flora."
