    "intro": "Hydrocotyle leucocephala var. intermedia, commonly known as the white-headed marsh penny, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, round, succulent leaves that are often floating or submerged, adapted to aquatic conditions. The plant produces white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, adding ornamental value to its habitat. Its root system is fibrous, helping to stabilize soil in marshy areas. It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and wetlands."
