    "intro": "Hygrophila salicifolia var. megalantha, commonly known as the giant hygrophila, is a striking aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 20 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow to still freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rapid growth rate makes it a popular choice for aquascaping and water garden decoration. The flowers, which are small and clustered, are typically yellow or orange and bloom during the wet season."
