    "intro": "Homalanthus milvus, commonly known as the Hawaiian milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and large, showy yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic and can cause skin irritation. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as forests and stream banks. Homalanthus milvus plays a role in the local ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insects."
