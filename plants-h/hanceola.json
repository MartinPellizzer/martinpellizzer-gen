    "intro": "Hanceola, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are typically clustered in axillary inflorescences. Hanceola is often found in wetland areas and can thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
