    "intro": "Hypericum hachijyoense f. nigrum, commonly known as the black-stemmed St. John's wort, is a rare and unique variant of the St. John's wort genus. It is native to Japan, specifically the Hachijo Islands, where it thrives in coastal and rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its dark, almost black stems, which contrast with its bright yellow flowers. Its foliage consists of small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. This form is of particular interest to botanists due to its distinct coloration and limited distribution."
