    "intro": "Hibiscus rupestris, commonly known as the rock hibiscus, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and fleshy, often hairy stems that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its leaves are typically ovate or elliptical, with a rough texture that aids in reducing water loss. Hibiscus rupestris is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous areas."
