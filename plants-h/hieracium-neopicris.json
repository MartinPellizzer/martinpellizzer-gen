    "intro": "Hieracium neopicris, commonly known as the lesser hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and basal rosettes of broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to Europe, it thrives in moist meadows and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it a common sight in temperate regions, though it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
