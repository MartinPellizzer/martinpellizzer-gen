    "intro": "Hymenoxys latissima, commonly known as the broadleaf hymenoxys, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of broad, waxy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with prominent yellow stamens, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Hymenoxys latissima is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant once established."
