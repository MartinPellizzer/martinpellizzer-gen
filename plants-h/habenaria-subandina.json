    "intro": "Habenaria subandina, commonly known as the Andean butterfly orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andes mountains of South America. It typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in cool and humid conditions. The plant produces delicate, butterfly-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with intricate patterns. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the thin soil of its habitat. Habenaria subandina is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
