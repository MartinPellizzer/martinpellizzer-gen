    "intro": "Helleborus purpurascens var. viridiflorus, commonly known as the green-flowered hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and clusters of striking, bell-shaped flowers that range from white to pale green. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky soils. It produces a toxic, milky sap that contains various alkaloids, making it potentially harmful if ingested. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and early spring flowering."
