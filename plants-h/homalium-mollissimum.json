It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are covered in a dense, silky pubescence. It produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often obscured by the foliage. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds."
