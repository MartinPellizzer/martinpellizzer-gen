    "intro": "Heteropterys aceroides subf. tiliifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian maple, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of maple trees. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that release tiny seeds. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage, making it a popular choice for landscaping in warm regions."
