    "intro": "Hieracium umbellatum var. microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited yarrow. It is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its clustered inflorescence and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer, and its fruits are diminutive achenes surrounded by pappus hairs. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, it thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
