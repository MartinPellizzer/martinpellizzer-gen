It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with a pinnate venation pattern. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or red, often with a yellow or orange center. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in humid, well-drained soils. Helicteres pinnata is often found in tropical forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and medicinal properties."
