    "intro": "Harpalyce ekmanii var. angustiflora, commonly known as the narrow-flower harpalyce, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in small, pod-like fruits that split open to release the seeds, aiding in its dispersal. This species is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
