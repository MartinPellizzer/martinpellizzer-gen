    "intro": "Habenaria garayana, commonly known as the Garay's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its terrestrial growth habit and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, while its rhizomes allow for vegetative propagation. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
