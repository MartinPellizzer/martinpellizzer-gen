    "intro": "Heliamphora folliculata, commonly known as the pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the tepuis of South America. It is characterized by its unique pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden liquid to trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs that aid in trapping prey. The plant's botanical features make it a fascinating subject for both ecological study and horticultural interest."
