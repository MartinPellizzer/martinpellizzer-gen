    "intro": "Hylorhipsalis floccosa, commonly known as the fluffball pothos, is a climbing vine native to South America. It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and a pale green to yellowish hue. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its unique, fluffy appearance comes from the dense, soft growth of its stems and leaves. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance for low light and minimal care requirements."
