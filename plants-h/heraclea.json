    "intro": "Heraclea, commonly known as the Hercules club, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Heracleum sphondylios, which is native to southern Europe and western Asia. These plants are characterized by their tall, hollow stems and large, umbrella-shaped inflorescences. The leaves are typically pinnately divided and can be quite large, often with a strong, aromatic odor. Heraclea species are often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and riverbanks."
