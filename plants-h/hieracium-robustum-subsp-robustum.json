    "intro": "Hieracium robustum subsp. robustum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow flowers. The plant typically has basal and stem leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. It produces numerous small, daisy-like flowers in clusters, which are followed by seed heads that release tiny seeds with pappus for wind dispersal. Hieracium robustum subsp. robustum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it is known for its aggressive spreading habit."
