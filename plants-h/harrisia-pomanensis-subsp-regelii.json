It is a columnar cactus with a dense covering of spines and produces vibrant, showy flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a succulent stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink and emit a strong fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil and full sun exposure."
