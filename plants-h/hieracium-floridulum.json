    "intro": "Hieracium floridulum, commonly known as the Florida hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a distinctive central disc. Hieracium floridulum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit and ability to spread rapidly."
