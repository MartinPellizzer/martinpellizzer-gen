    "intro": "Hoppea, commonly known as the \"silk cotton tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, many of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. The plants are characterized by their showy, often pink or red flowers and their fluffy, cotton-like seed capsules. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with simple, alternate leaves and a preference for well-drained soils. Hoppea species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated for their fibrous seeds."
