    "intro": "Hovea longifolia var. montana, commonly known as the mountain hovea, is a shrub native to the eastern regions of Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in open forests or rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
