    "intro": "Hieracium rarinaevum, commonly known as the rare yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are bright yellow with a central disk. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
