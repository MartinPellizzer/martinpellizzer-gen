    "intro": "Hydrocotyle maritima, commonly known as sea shield or seaside bugloss, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Americas. It is a low-growing perennial with heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in sandy or muddy soils along shorelines and is adapted to tolerate salt spray and tidal conditions. Hydrocotyle maritima plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
