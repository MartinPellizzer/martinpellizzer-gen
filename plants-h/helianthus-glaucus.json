    "intro": "Helianthus glaucus, commonly known as the blue glaucous sunflower, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking blue-gray foliage and yellow-orange flower heads that resemble those of other sunflowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a waxy coating, and its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer. Helianthus glaucus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
