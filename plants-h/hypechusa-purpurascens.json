It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This species is typically found in moist, shaded environments within cloud forests. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
