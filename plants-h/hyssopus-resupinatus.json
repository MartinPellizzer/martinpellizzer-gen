    "intro": "Hyssopus resupinatus, commonly known as creeping hyssop, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are aromatic when crushed, giving it a distinctive scent. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
