    "intro": "Hieracium kerneri subsp. subcuspidatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe. It features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and road sides. Its subspecies distinction is based on subtle differences in leaf shape and hair density compared to other Hieracium species."
