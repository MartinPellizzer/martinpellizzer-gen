    "intro": "Hakea rufa, commonly known as the red hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and its distinctive red or orange flowers that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically arranged in cylindrical spikes and are visited by a variety of pollinators, including bees and birds. Hakea rufa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native gardens and landscapes."
