    "intro": "Hieracium pseudomicans, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces numerous small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its aggressive growth, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
