    "intro": "Hieracium scissum, commonly known as the cutleaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed or divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it an invasive species in some regions."
