    "intro": "Hohenbergia erythrostachys, commonly known as the red-stemmed hohenbergia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces striking red bracts that surround its small, white flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hohenbergia erythrostachys is popular as a decorative plant due to its vibrant appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
