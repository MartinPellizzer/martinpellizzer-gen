    "intro": "Habenaria satyrioides, commonly known as the satyr orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink or white flowers that resemble the appearance of a satyr, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. It has a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. The leaves are linear and arranged in a basal rosette, supporting the inflorescence of its fragrant, showy flowers."
