    "intro": "Hypochaeris radicata subsp. heterocarpa, commonly known as the heterocarpic sowthistle, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and bright yellow composite flowers. The species is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. It typically grows in disturbed soils and sunny areas, such as roadsides and fields. The plant produces small, ribbed fruits that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread."
