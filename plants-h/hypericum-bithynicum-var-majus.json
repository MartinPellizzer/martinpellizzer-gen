    "intro": "Hypericum bithynicum var. majus, commonly known as the greater St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to southeastern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features simple, opposite, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly rough texture. Its medicinal properties are attributed to the presence of hypericin and pseudohypericin, which are bioactive compounds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens and natural landscapes."
