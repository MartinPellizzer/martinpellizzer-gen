    "intro": "Hesperhodos mirificus, commonly known as the magnificent evening-flower, is a striking member of the Gentianaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its vivid blue to purple flowers that bloom in the late afternoon, attracting pollinators such as butterflies and hummingbirds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reflect excess sunlight. Hesperhodos mirificus thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish."
