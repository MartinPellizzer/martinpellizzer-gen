    "intro": "Herniaria incana var. africana, commonly known as African sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It features small, fleshy, blue-gray leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces tiny white or pale blue flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its succulent structure allows it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils with minimal water. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
