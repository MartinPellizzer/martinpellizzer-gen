    "intro": "Hepatica integrifolia, commonly known as the northern liverleaf, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive palmately lobed leaves that resemble a liver, hence its common name. The plant typically blooms in early spring with showy blue to purple flowers that have five petals. It thrives in moist, woodland environments and is often found in shaded areas with rich, organic soil. Hepatica integrifolia plays an important role in early pollination and is a valued plant in native plant gardens."
