    "intro": "Hymenophyllum macrothecum, commonly known as the broad-leaved maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided, and often overlapping leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is notable for its ability to tolerate high humidity and is often found in epiphytic growth in rainforests."
