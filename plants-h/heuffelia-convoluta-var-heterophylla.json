    "intro": "Heuffelia convoluta var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable heuffelia, is a member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that vary in shape and size across different parts of the plant. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. Its variability in leaf morphology makes it an interesting subject for botanical study."
