    "intro": "Hieracium aequifolium, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are typically lobed or toothed, and its yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It has hairy stems and produces numerous small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium aequifolium is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
