    "intro": "Heliotropium chenopodiaceum var. ericoideum, commonly known as coastal heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant has prostrate or ascending stems, often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are typically elliptic to ovate in shape. It thrives in sandy or calcareous soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal conditions. The species is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
