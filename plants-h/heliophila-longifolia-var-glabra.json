    "intro": "Heliophila longifolia var. glabra, commonly known as smooth heliophyllum, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy, though the varietal name 'glabra' indicates a smoother texture compared to other varieties. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, with a slightly rough texture, and it prefers moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds."
