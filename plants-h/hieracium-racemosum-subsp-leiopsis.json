    "intro": "Hieracium racemosum subsp. leiopsis, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has basal and stem leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it distinguishable from other hawkweed species, particularly in its leaf structure and flowering pattern."
