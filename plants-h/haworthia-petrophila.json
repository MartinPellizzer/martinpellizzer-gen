    "intro": "Haworthia petrophila, commonly known as the rock haworthia, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves with white or pale markings, often resembling a star pattern. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically blooming in late winter or early spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or indoor cultivation. Haworthia petrophila is well-suited to bright, indirect light and is relatively low maintenance."
