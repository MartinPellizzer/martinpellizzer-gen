    "intro": "Hypolepis jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican water fern, is a member of the Dennstaedtiaceae family and is native to the Caribbean. It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, frond-like structure and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread across the ground, forming dense mats. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a distinctive, fern-like appearance that contributes to its ornamental value. Hypolepis jamaicensis is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and its ability to thrive in humid conditions."
