    "intro": "Himantoglossum jankae subsp. robustissimum, commonly known as the robust mountain orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to the ecological stability of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
