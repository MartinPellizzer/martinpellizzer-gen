    "intro": "Hydrocharis bodinieri, commonly known as the floating heart, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Araceae family and is characterized by its floating, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, emerging from the leaf axils. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes, where it can spread rapidly through vegetative reproduction. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, it can become invasive in non-native habitats."
