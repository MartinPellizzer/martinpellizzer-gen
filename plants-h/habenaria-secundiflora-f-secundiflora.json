It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with a distinctive spurred lip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
