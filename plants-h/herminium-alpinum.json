    "intro": "Herminium alpinum, commonly known as the alpine twayblade, is a perennial orchid native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, preferring cool and moist conditions. Its rhizome system allows it to survive in harsh environments, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems. Herminium alpinum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
