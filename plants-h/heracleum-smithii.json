    "intro": "Heracleum smithii, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features large, umbrella-shaped (umbellate) flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are deeply lobed with a distinctive, hairy texture. The plant can grow up to 5 meters in height, making it one of the tallest members of the carrot family (Apiaceae). Its stem is covered in coarse hairs and has a milky sap that can cause severe skin irritation. It is considered an invasive species in many areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
