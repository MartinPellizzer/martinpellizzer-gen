    "intro": "Hymenophyllum praetervisum var. australiense, commonly known as the Australian filmy fern, is a small, delicate fern native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in a fine, translucent layer of tissue, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in small groups on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among members of the Hymenophyllum genus. This variant is distinguished by its slightly broader fronds and a more robust growth habit compared to other varieties within the species."
