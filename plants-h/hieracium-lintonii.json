    "intro": "Hieracium lintonii, commonly known as Linton's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, and it produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
