    "intro": "Hieracium cymosum subsp. heldreichianum, commonly known as the Balkan hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming basal leaves and yellow flowering heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller, more compact inflorescences compared to other members of the species."
