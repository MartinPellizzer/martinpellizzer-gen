    "intro": "Hieracium tenuiceps, commonly known as slender-headed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a single terminal capitulum. It has a taproot system and is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas. The species is often considered a weed due to its aggressive spreading habit."
