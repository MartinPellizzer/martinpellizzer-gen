    "intro": "Hymenophyllum fumarioides, commonly known as the fumarioid moss, is a small, evergreen fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided, and often hairy leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are usually located on the underside of the fronds. Hymenophyllum fumarioides is known for its ability to retain moisture, making it well adapted to humid, tropical climates."
