    "intro": "Huperzia austrosinica, commonly known as the Chinese rock huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, and often scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette formation. The plant is native to Southeast Asia, including regions of China, Vietnam, and the Philippines. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Huperzia austrosinica is notable for its primitive morphology and is of interest in botanical studies due to its evolutionary significance."
