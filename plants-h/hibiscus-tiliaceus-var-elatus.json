    "intro": "Hibiscus tiliaceus var. elatus, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often slightly hairy underneath. The plant produces large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink or red, typically with a prominent yellow or orange throat. It thrives in coastal areas, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils, making it a common sight in mangrove ecosystems. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in traditional medicine."
