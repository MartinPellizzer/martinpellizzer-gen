    "intro": "Habenaria flexa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often near the base of trees or on rocky substrates. The plant produces slender, grass-like leaves and bears small, pale green or white flowers with intricate patterns. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
