    "intro": "Helleborus croaticus f. angustisectus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hellebore, is a rare and distinctive variant of the hellebore genus. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and striking, dark violet flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. This plant is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly Croatia, where it thrives in shaded, moist woodland environments. Its botanical features make it a unique subject for horticultural and ecological study. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
