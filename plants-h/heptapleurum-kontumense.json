    "intro": "Heptapleurum kontumense, commonly known as Kontum stonecrop, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Vietnam. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in shades of white or pink, adding to its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
