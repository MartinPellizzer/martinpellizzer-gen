    "intro": "Hieracium pseudohispidulum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of tubular and ray florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are hairy and lance-shaped, and the flowers are yellow, often with a reddish tinge at the base. It is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
