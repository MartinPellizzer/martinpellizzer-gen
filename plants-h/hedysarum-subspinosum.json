    "intro": "Hedysarum subspinosum, commonly known as the spiny milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers in racemate clusters, followed by pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. Hedysarum subspinosum plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
