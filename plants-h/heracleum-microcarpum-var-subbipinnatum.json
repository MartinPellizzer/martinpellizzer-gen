    "intro": "Heracleum microcarpum var. subbipinnatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cow parsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnate leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. The fruit is a small, dry schizocarp that splits into two parts when mature."
