    "intro": "Hierochloe setifolia, commonly known as slender hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and delicate, feathery inflorescences that resemble a plume. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in meadows, wetlands, and along streambanks. Its small, wind-dispersed seeds contribute to its ability to colonize disturbed or open habitats. Hierochloe setifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting insect and bird populations."
