    "intro": "Hieracium almquistii, commonly known as Almqvist's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually basal, forming a rosette, and its flowers are yellow, with ray florets surrounding a central disk. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
