    "intro": "Hesperastragalus catalinensis, commonly known as Catalina milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Channel Islands of California. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal habitats and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its environment. It has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
