It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201380 cm, with hairy stems and basal leaves that are often lobed or toothed. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, producing achenes that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium macrocoelium is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites, where it can form dense colonies."
