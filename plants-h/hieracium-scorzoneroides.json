    "intro": "Hieracium scorzoneroides, commonly known as the scarlet hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its bright yellow to orange flowers are surrounded by pale green to white ray florets, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium scorzoneroides is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas."
