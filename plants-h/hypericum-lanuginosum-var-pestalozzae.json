    "intro": "Hypericum lanuginosum var. pestalozzae, commonly known as the woolly St. John's wort, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance, with leaves covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in small, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sunny soils and is often found in alpine and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and herbal gardens."
