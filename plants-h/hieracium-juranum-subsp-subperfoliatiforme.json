    "intro": "Hieracium juranum subsp. subperfoliatiforme, commonly known as the subperfoliate hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming basal leaves that are subperfoliate, meaning they partially encircle the stem. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in meadows and grasslands, often in moist or slightly shaded environments. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Hieracium genus, with specific adaptations to its ecological niche."
