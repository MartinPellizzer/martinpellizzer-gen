    "intro": "Haworthiopsis tessellata var. tessellata, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a compact, succulent perennial native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves with distinctive white or light green markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
