    "intro": "Haworthia rossouwii var. petrophila, commonly known as the rock haworthia, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or pale blue markings, resembling a rosette. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves to survive dry conditions. It produces small, white flowers on tall stems during the growing season. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
