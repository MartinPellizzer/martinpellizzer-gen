    "intro": "Hygrophila, commonly known as water hyssop, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae. These plants are typically found in wetland environments and are characterized by their opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Hygrophila species often have showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Many species are cultivated as ornamental plants or used in traditional medicine due to their aromatic properties."
