    "intro": "Haplopappus haenkei, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial with distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation across dry landscapes."
