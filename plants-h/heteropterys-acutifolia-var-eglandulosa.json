    "intro": "Heteropterys acutifolia var. eglandulosa, commonly known as the glandular-leafed huito, is a shrub native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves that are often covered with small, glandular structures. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, winged fruits. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a distinct, aromatic scent. This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its more pronounced glandular features on the foliage."
