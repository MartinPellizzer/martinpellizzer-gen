    "intro": "Hetaeria pelota, commonly known as the pelota lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms a distinctive, flat, leaf-like structure. It typically grows on tree bark, especially on conifers, in temperate to subtropical regions. The thallus is usually green to yellowish in color, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. It consists of a symbiotic association between a photosynthetic alga and a fungal partner. This lichen is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to pollutants."
