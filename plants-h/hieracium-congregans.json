It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium congregans is often found in clusters, giving it its common name, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
