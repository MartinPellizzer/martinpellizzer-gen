    "intro": "Hieracium nigrantipilum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are hairy and often have a bluish or greyish hue, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing small yellow blooms that attract various pollinators."
