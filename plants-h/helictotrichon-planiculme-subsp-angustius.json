It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, hairless stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a compact cluster of spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family.
