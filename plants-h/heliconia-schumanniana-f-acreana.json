It belongs to the Heliconiaceae family and is characterized by its large, brightly colored bracts that resemble petals, which serve to attract pollinators. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers surrounded by fleshy, leaf-like structures. Its leaves are broad, elongated, and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is valued in horticulture for its vibrant appearance and ability to thrive in humid, warm climates."
