    "intro": "Heliotropium erosum, commonly known as the sticky heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and purple. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which can deter herbivores. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Heliotropium erosum is also known for its ability to spread rapidly through vegetative reproduction."
