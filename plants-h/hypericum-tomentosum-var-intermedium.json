    "intro": "Hypericum tomentosum var. intermedium, commonly known as the woolly St. John's wort, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features dense, soft, white-gray pubescence covering its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are often followed by red-orange berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its medicinal properties, including potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, have been studied in traditional herbal practices."
