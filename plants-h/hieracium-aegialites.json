It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, where it thrives in salty and windy conditions. Its yellow-orange flowers bloom in late summer, and the leaves are lance-shaped with rough textures. Hieracium aegialites is often found in dune ecosystems, playing a role in stabilizing sand and supporting local biodiversity."
