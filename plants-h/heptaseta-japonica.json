    "intro": "Heptaseta japonica, commonly known as the Japanese arrowhead, is a herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves and spadix inflorescence. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Heptaseta japonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
