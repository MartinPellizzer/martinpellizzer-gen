    "intro": "Hieracium pubipes, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosette of leaves, which are typically covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces numerous yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Hieracium pubipes is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, where it can sometimes become invasive."
