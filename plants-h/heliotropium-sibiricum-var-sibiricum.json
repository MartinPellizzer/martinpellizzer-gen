    "intro": "Heliotropium sibiricum var. sibiricum, commonly known as Siberian heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of Siberia and Central Asia. It is a low-growing herb with slender, often hairy stems that can reach up to 30 centimeters in height. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This species is adapted to grow in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open, sunny areas."
