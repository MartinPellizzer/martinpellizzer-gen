    "intro": "Hymenocoleus neurodictyon var. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental nettle-leaf, is a variant of the genus Hymenocoleus within the family Hypoxidaceae. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are often hidden among the foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphological features and its role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats."
