    "intro": "Hedysarum monilifer, commonly known as the bead-pea, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, bead-like pods that contain several seeds, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Hedysarum monilifer is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
