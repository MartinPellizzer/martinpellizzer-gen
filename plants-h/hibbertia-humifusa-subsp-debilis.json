    "intro": "Hibbertia humifusa subsp. debilis, commonly known as the slender sand-verbena, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to southern Australia. It features small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or heathland environments. Hibbertia humifusa subsp. debilis is an important component of local ecosystems, providing nectar for native pollinators."
