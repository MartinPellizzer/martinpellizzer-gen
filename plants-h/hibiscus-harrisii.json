    "intro": "Hibiscus harrisii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, often with a contrasting yellow throat. The plant has hairy, woody stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Hibiscus harrisii blooms during the summer months, producing flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is a hardy species that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in desert landscapes."
