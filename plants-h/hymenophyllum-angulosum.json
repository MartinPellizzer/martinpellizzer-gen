    "intro": "Hymenophyllum angulosum, commonly known as the angular hymenophyllum, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is a small, terrestrial, and often epiphytic plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a delicate, fern-like appearance with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of rhizoids. Its reproductive structures, called sorocarps, are borne on short stalks and contain the spores. Hymenophyllum angulosum plays a significant role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms."
