    "intro": "Hieracium suppleens, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its bright yellow flowers consist of both ray and disk florets, and it produces small, oblong achenes as fruits. Hieracium suppleens is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
