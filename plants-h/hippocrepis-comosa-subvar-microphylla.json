It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features a compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, helmet-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink. Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller leaves compared to the typical variety of Hippocrepis comosa."
