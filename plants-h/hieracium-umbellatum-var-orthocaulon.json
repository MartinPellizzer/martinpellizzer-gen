    "intro": "Hieracium umbellatum var. orthocaulon, commonly known as the upright hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it has a creeping rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. This variant is distinguished by its more upright growth habit compared to other varieties of Hieracium."
