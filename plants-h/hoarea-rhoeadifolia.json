    "intro": "Hoarea rhoeadifolia, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its flowering period is typically short, lasting only a few weeks, and it is often found in alpine meadows. Hoarea rhoeadifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
