It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that resemble grape leaves, hence its common name. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow to red, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its flowers are typically followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Hibiscus vitifolius subsp. vitifolius is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun."
