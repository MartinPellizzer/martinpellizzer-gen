    "intro": "Hordeum lapponicum, commonly known as Arctic barley, is a species of grass native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing plant that thrives in cold, harsh environments, often found in tundra and alpine habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of hairs, helping to reduce water loss in extreme conditions. Hordeum lapponicum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic flora and fauna."
