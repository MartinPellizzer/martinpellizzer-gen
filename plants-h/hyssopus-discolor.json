    "intro": "Hyssopus discolor, commonly known as blue hyssop, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite leaves that are usually lance-shaped and aromatic. The plant produces spikes of blue or purple flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hyssopus discolor thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its historical use in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb adds to its botanical and cultural significance."
