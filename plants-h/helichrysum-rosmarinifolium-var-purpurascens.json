    "intro": "Helichrysum rosmarinifolium var. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are aromatic, with a strong, herb-like scent reminiscent of rosemary. This variety is noted for its striking purple-tinged flower heads, which retain their color well when dried. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is also used in herbal medicine."
