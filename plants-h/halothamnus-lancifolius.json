    "intro": "Halothamnus lancifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved halothamnus, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and linear, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, spherical fruits. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Halothamnus lancifolius is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is relatively drought-tolerant."
