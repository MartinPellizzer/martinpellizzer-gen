    "intro": "Helianthus buphthalmoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf sunflower, is a species native to the central and eastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its yellow composite flowers and linear leaves. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes many other sunflowers and daisies. Its scientific name reflects its resemblance to the common sunflower (Helianthus annuus) but with narrower leaves. It thrives in open habitats such as prairies and roadsides, often blooming in late summer and early fall."
