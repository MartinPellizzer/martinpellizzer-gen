    "intro": "Helwingia chinensis var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the Chinese helwingia, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and have serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by distinctive, elongated, red-brown fruits. It thrives in woodland environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of botanical circles."
