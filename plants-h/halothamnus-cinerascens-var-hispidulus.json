    "intro": "Halothamnus cinerascens var. hispidulus, commonly known as the hispid sandthrift, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with gray-green, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seed capsules are ribbed and contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and inland deserts."
