It features strap-like, bright green leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, with each flower lasting only one day, hence its common name. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Hemerocallis liliastrum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
