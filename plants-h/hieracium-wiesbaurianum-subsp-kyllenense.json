    "intro": "Hieracium wiesbaurianum subsp. kyllenense, commonly known as the Kyllenense Hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming basal leaves and yellowish to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its spread. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in parts of its range."
