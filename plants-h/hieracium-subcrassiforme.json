    "intro": "Hieracium subcrassiforme, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in some regions and can outcompete native vegetation."
