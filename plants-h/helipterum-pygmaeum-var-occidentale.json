    "intro": "Helipterum pygmaeum var. occidentale, commonly known as the western pygmy sunflower, is a small, herbaceous plant native to western Australia. It is characterized by its compact stature, typically growing no taller than 10 centimeters, and features showy yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has hairy, linear leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
