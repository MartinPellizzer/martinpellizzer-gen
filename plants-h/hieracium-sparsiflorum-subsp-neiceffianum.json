    "intro": "Hieracium sparsiflorum subsp. neiceffianum, commonly known as the sparse-flowered hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit and yellowish-green flowering heads. The subspecies is distinguished by its sparse, elongated flower heads and narrow, linear leaves. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
