It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Henriettea gibberosa thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to drought conditions. It is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, contributing to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
