    "intro": "Huertia, commonly known as stonecrop, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae. These succulent plants are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are characterized by their fleshy, water-storing leaves. Many species of Huertia have a rosette growth form, which helps them conserve moisture in arid environments. They produce small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, often in the spring or summer. Huertia species are popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to their low maintenance and ornamental value."
