It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped with serrated or toothed margins, which give the subspecies its common name. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. The plant is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and medicinal properties in some species."
