It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces woody pods containing seeds that are the edible Brazil nuts. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a natural defense against pests and diseases. The plant plays a vital ecological role in supporting biodiversity and is also economically significant for its nut production."
