    "intro": "Hedysarum alpinum subsp. philoscia, commonly known as the alpine vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. This subspecies thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing in open, sunny habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in nutrient-poor areas. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
