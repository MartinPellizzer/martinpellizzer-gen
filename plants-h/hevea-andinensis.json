    "intro": "Hevea andinensis, commonly known as the Andean rubber tree, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows in humid, tropical climates. The plant is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. It is known for producing latex, which has been historically used for rubber production. However, it is less commercially significant compared to other Hevea species like Hevea brasiliensis."
