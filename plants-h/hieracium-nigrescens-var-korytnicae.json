    "intro": "Hieracium nigrescens var. korytnicae, commonly known as the Korytnica hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Central Europe. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
