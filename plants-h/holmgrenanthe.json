    "intro": "Holmgrenanthe, commonly known as the \"bushy bellflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plants typically have a shrub-like growth habit with woody stems and opposite leaves. Holmgrenanthe species are often found in dry, rocky habitats and are valued for their ornamental appeal. Due to their limited distribution, many species are considered rare and are of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
