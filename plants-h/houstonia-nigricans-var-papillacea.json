    "intro": "Houstonia nigricans var. papillacea, commonly known as the papillate bluetail, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils within woodlands and shaded areas. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. This variety is distinguished by the papillate (bumpy) surface on its petals, which gives it its scientific name."
