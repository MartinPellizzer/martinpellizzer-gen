It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves and produces a milky latex sap used in rubber production. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates with high rainfall, typically growing in lowland areas. Its bark is thick and fibrous, providing structural support and protection. This variety is often cultivated for commercial rubber extraction due to its high latex yield."
