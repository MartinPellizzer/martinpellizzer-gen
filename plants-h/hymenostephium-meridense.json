    "intro": "Hymenostephium meridense, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that grows from a fibrous root system and has a branching stem covered in soft, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish-white in color. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Hymenostephium meridense is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it an important component of desert ecosystems."
