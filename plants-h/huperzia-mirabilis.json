    "intro": "Huperzia mirabilis, commonly known as the fairy moss or the zigzag huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and its unique, often zigzagging fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually small, with a leathery texture and a distinct, serrated margin. Huperzia mirabilis is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in maintaining ecological balance in its native habitats."
