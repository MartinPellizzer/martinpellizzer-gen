    "intro": "Herminium yunnanense, commonly known as the Yunnan tassel orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like leaves and a dense cluster of showy, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its unique inflorescence structure, which resembles a tassel. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
