    "intro": "Hedysarum renifolium, commonly known as the kidneyleaf peavine, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are kidney-shaped and have a distinctive reniform appearance. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Hedysarum renifolium thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe habitats. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration efforts."
