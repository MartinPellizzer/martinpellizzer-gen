It typically grows to a height of about 30-60 cm and features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in the summer months. Hyalocystis popovii is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas.
