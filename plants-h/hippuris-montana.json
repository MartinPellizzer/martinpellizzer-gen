    "intro": "Hippuris montana, commonly known as the mountain water-plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in mountain streams and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes and bloom in early summer. Hippuris montana plays an important role in stabilizing aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
