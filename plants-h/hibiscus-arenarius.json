    "intro": "Hibiscus arenarius, commonly known as the sand hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, large, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often with a distinctive dark center. The plant has hairy, ribbed leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high temperatures and low rainfall. Hibiscus arenarius is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
