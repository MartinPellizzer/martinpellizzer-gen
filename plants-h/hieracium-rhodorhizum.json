    "intro": "Hieracium rhodorhizum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate leaves and yellow ray florets that surround a central disk of tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive. Its growth habit and floral structure make it a notable species in ecological and botanical studies."
