    "intro": "Hedyotis nervosa, commonly known as the narrow-veined inchplant, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It features small, opposite leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape, with prominent venation patterns. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Hedyotis nervosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and flowering habit."
