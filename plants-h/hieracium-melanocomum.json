It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are dark green and often have a rough, hairy texture, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium melanocomum is generally not considered invasive but can be a weed in agricultural settings."
