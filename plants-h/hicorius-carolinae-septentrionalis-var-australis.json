    "intro": "Hicorius carolinae-septentrionalis var. australis, commonly known as the Southern Carolinian Hicorius, is a rare variant of the Hicorius genus native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that are typically a deep green with a subtle blue hue. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink during the late spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun exposure. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
