    "intro": "Hibiscus aphelus, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its tall, woody stems and large, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Hibiscus aphelus produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is a hardy species well adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone conditions."
