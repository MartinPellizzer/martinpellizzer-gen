    "intro": "Habenaria schinzii, commonly known as the Schinz's orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive yellow lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
