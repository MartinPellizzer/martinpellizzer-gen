    "intro": "Hyacinthus decolorans, commonly known as the pale hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It produces clusters of fragrant, pale blue to white flowers in early spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its botanical name reflects its distinctive coloration, which is lighter than that of typical hyacinths."
