    "intro": "Hieracium orithales, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It produces yellow flowers with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, and its leaves are usually hairy and alternate along the stem. Hieracium orithales is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
