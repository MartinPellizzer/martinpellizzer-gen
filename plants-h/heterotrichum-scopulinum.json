    "intro": "Heterotrichum scopulinum, commonly known as the mossy clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, creeping plant that forms dense mats on moist, shaded forest floors, typically in temperate regions. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls. Its reproductive structures, called strobili, are cone-like and contain sporangia that release spores for propagation. Heterotrichum scopulinum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
