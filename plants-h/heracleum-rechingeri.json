    "intro": "Heracleum rechingeri, commonly known as the Persian cowpariah, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. It is a tall herbaceous plant that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, featuring hollow, ribbed stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in compound umbels, which are typically borne on long, slender stalks. Its leaves and stems are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. However, it is important to note that the plant contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
