    "intro": "Hieronymiella vittata, commonly known as the golden ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant features delicate, strap-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers with a distinctive golden stripe down the center of each petal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
