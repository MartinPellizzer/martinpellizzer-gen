    "intro": "Hieracium cavillieri subsp. vesubiense, commonly known as the Vesuvian hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the volcanic soils of the Vesuvius area in Italy. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and yellow flowers arranged in a composite head. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
