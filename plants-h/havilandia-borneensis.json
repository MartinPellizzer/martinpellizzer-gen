    "intro": "Havilandia borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean orchid, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature vibrant colors. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Havilandia borneensis plays a significant role in the biodiversity of its habitat and is often found in shaded, humid environments."
