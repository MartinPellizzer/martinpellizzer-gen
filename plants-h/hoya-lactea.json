    "intro": "Hoya lactea, commonly known as the \"milk jade\" or \"silver queen,\" is a popular epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, and often silver-colored leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, which bloom at the ends of its stems. Hoya lactea thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is relatively low-maintenance, making it a favored choice for indoor gardening."
