    "intro": "Hymenophyllum funckii, commonly known as the Funck's filmy fern, is a delicate and low-growing epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, translucent fronds that resemble delicate tissue paper. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in rainforests. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Hymenophyllum funckii is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its habitat."
