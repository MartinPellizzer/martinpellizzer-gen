    "intro": "Hieracium sulphureum, commonly known as the sulphur hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its bright yellow flowers, which resemble a cluster of small suns, are surrounded by bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are usually hairy and lance-shaped, and the plant often forms dense colonies in its native environment."
