    "intro": "Hesperis laciniata, commonly known as the cut-leaved bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely dissected, lobed leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, often found in meadows and woodland edges. Hesperis laciniata is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
