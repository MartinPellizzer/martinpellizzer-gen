    "intro": "Hedyotis longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered bladdernut, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Asia. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, often blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Hedyotis longiflora is valued in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
