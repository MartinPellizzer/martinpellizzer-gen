The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, and it plays a role in stabilizing desert soils. Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered an important indicator species for arid ecosystems."
