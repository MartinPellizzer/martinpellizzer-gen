It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that gives it a silvery appearance, particularly on the underside of the leaves. The plant has a compact, rounded crown and produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are typically opposite and have a distinctive, waxy texture. Humboltia agathophylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in humid, coastal environments."
