    "intro": "Helianthus senex, commonly known as the old sunflower, is a perennial plant native to the eastern and central United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant produces yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rustic appearance. Helianthus senex is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to native gardens."
