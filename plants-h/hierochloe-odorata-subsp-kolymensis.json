    "intro": "Hierochloe odorata subsp. kolymensis, commonly known as the Arctic feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, silky hairs that give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in cold, dry environments and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, pale green to brown flowers in early summer. This subspecies is adapted to extreme conditions, making it an important component of high-altitude and polar ecosystems."
