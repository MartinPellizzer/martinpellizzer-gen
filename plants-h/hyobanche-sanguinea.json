    "intro": "Hyobanche sanguinea, commonly known as red Indian smokeplant, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of woody species. The plant produces showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine, though its parasitic nature makes it a challenging subject for study. Botanically, it is classified in the family Orobanchaceae, which includes other hemiparasitic species."
