It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces yellowish to reddish flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it often grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils.
