    "intro": "Hieracium glaucinum subsp. pseudobasalticum, commonly known as the basalt dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the volcanic regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
