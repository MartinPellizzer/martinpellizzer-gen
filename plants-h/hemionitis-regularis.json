It has finely divided, feather-like leaves that float on the water surface, with roots hanging below. The plant thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. Hemionitis regularis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
