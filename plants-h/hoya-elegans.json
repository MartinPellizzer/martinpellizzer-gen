    "intro": "Hoya elegans, commonly known as the \"Wax Plant\" or \"Floral Crown,\" is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of star-shaped flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without being parasitic. Hoya elegans thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
