It is a small, mat-forming perennial that typically grows in coastal and sandy environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are succulent and often have a bluish tint, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. This variety is characterized by its unique structure, with leaves that appear to be inflated, resembling bladders, which aid in water retention."
