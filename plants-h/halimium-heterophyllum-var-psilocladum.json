    "intro": "Halimium heterophyllum var. psilocladum, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to red flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in xerophytic ecosystems."
