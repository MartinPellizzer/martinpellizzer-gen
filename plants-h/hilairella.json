    "intro": "Hilairella, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to saline environments. They have distinctive blue or purple flower heads that resemble holly berries, hence their common name. Hilairella species often have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. Their ability to thrive in harsh, maritime conditions makes them an important component of coastal ecosystems."
