    "intro": "Hydnophytum formicarum dubium, commonly known as the ant plant, is a hemi-epiphytic plant that forms a symbiotic relationship with ants. It produces specialized structures called domatia, which serve as housing for ant colonies. The plant's leaves are modified into leaf-like structures that provide shelter and food for the ants. The ants, in turn, protect the plant from herbivores and help in nutrient cycling. This unique botanical relationship is a fascinating example of mutualism in tropical ecosystems."
