It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine, silky hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
