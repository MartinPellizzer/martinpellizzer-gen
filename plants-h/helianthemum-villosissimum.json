It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone areas. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and used in landscaping."
