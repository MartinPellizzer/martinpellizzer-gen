    "intro": "Humboldtia, commonly known as the \"Humboldt's glory,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Humboldtia sericea, which is native to South America, particularly Brazil. These plants are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. Humboldtia species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. They have hairy foliage and produce capsules as fruits, which contain the seeds."
