    "intro": "Heteropterys hatschbachii, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is known for its hard, dense wood, which has been historically valued for musical instruments and furniture. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, well-drained soils. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
