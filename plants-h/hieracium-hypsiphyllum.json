    "intro": "Hieracium hypsiphyllum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Due to its habitat preferences, it is often found in high-altitude meadows and is adapted to withstand cold and harsh climatic conditions."
