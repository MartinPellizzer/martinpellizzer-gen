    "intro": "Hydrosme hildebrandtii, commonly known as the Hildebrandt's hydrosme, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hydrosme hildebrandtii is considered a vulnerable species."
