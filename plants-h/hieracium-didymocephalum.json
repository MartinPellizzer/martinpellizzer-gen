    "intro": "Hieracium didymocephalum, commonly known as the two-headed hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers consist of yellow disk florets surrounded by pale yellow to white ray florets. Hieracium didymocephalum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
