    "intro": "Huperzia subfalciformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its simple, linear leaves that are often curved or folded, giving it a distinctive appearance. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. The sporophylls are arranged in a spiral pattern, and the plant produces spores in clusters on the underside of its leaves."
