    "intro": "Helichrysum scabrum, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and bright yellow to orange flowers that resemble small sunflowers. The plant is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions. Its leaves are typically gray-green due to the fine, woolly hairs covering them. Helichrysum scabrum is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
