    "intro": "Haworthia cymbiformis var. setulifera, commonly known as the serrated Haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically green with white or pale markings. The leaves are densely packed and have a textured, almost spiky appearance due to the presence of short, stiff hairs. It produces small, pale green flowers on tall, slender stems during the growing season. This variety is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and unique aesthetic."
