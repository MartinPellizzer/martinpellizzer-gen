    "intro": "Hieracium nigrescens subsp. lobatulans, commonly known as the black hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and yellowish to brownish composite flowers. The subspecies lobatulans is distinguished by its broadly lobed leaves, which set it apart from other members of the species. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
