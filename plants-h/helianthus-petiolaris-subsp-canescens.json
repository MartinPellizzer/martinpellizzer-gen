It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it tolerate sandy and dry soils. The plant produces yellow ray flowers surrounded by a series of brown, tubular disk flowers. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in full sun. Its botanical features make it well adapted to coastal and disturbed habitats."
