    "intro": "Haplopappus racemosus subsp. prionophyllus, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, white seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance, it is often used in xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
