    "intro": "Heyderia macrolepis, commonly known as the broad-leaved hedyera, is a climbing plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
