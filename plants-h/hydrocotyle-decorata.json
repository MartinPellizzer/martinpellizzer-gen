    "intro": "Hydrocotyle decorata, commonly known as the silverleaf marsh plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It features a rosette of broad, silver-green leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in aquatic or marshy habitats. Hydrocotyle decorata is adapted to fluctuating water levels and thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
