    "intro": "Hemionitis cumingiana, commonly known as the Cuming's hemionitis, is a rare and unique fern species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other members of the Hemionitidaceae family. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in shaded forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically located on the undersides of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
