The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its botanical characteristics include a woody stem, opposite leaf arrangement, and a preference for well-drained soils. It is often found in heathlands and open forests, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
