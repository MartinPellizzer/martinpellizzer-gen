    "intro": "Hieracium glaucinum subsp. suntaliense, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, whitish down, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. This subspecies is notable for its ability to colonize disturbed alpine soils and its role in stabilizing mountainous ecosystems."
