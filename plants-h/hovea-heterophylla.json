    "intro": "Hovea heterophylla, commonly known as the variable hovea, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves ranging from simple to compound forms depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, pale yellow to cream-colored flowers that bloom in clusters. Hovea heterophylla typically grows in coastal heathlands and sandy soils, often in areas with high salt exposure. Its adaptability to coastal environments makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
