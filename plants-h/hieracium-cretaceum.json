    "intro": "Hieracium cretaceum, commonly known as the Crete hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of Greece and Italy. It is a perennial herb characterized by its hairy, upright stems and basal rosettes of spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and limestone areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
