    "intro": "Hieracium accrescens, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and has a rosette of basal leaves with hairy surfaces. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by the production of seeds in small, fluffy structures. Hieracium accrescens is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
