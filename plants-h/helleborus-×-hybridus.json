It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and striking, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and prefers moist, well-drained soil in partial shade. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Helleborus niger and Helleborus orientalis, exhibiting traits from both parents. The Christmas rose is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded garden environments."
