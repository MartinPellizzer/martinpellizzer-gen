    "intro": "Helmiopsiella madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar horned fern, is a unique and rare plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like spore cases that protrude from its fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it can receive indirect light. Its fronds are usually elongated and have a leathery texture, with spore-producing structures known as sporangia. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
