It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring well-drained conditions. Its leaves are usually basal, with a rough, hairy texture, and the flowers are yellow, forming a flat-topped inflorescence. Rugel's hawkweed is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
