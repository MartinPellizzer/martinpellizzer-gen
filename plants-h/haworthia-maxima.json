    "intro": "Haworthia maxima, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves with white markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white flowers in the spring. Its compact size and unique appearance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
