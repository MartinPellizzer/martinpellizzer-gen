    "intro": "Hieracium furfuraceum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragworts. Its common name reflects the dense, woolly texture of its foliage, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions."
