    "intro": "Hieracium artvinense, commonly known as the Artvin hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of northeastern Turkey. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and cooler climates. Its yellow flowers are surrounded by a ring of pale green or white ray florets, and it produces small, oval-shaped achenes as seeds. Hieracium artvinense is a relatively rare species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
