It features striking, fleshy leaves with distinct white to yellowish markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant is characterized by its slow growth rate and ability to thrive in well-draining soil with minimal water. It prefers bright, indirect light and is well-suited for indoor cultivation. Haworthia bayeri is also known for its resilience to drought and ability to store water in its thick, fleshy leaves."
