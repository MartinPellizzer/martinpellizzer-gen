    "intro": "Henriettella tachirensis, commonly known as the Tachire mountain fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in cool, humid environments, often found in cloud forests at high altitudes. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a soft, velvety texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Henriettella tachirensis is considered a vulnerable species."
