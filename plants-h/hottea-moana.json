    "intro": "Hottea moana, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to coastal regions of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a contrasting yellow throat. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. Its roots are adapted to stabilize sandy soils, making it resilient to coastal conditions. The flowers attract pollinators like bees and birds, contributing to its ecological importance in marine ecosystems."
