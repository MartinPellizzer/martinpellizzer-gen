    "intro": "Helietta cuspidata f. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf helietta, is a rare and distinctive plant belonging to the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands or rocky slopes. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. The f. latifolia form is distinguished by its wider foliage compared to the typical variety."
