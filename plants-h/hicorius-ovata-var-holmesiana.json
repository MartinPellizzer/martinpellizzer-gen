It is characterized by its distinctive, branched stems and striking, showy flowers that are typically red or orange in color. The plant features palmate leaves with a hairy texture, which help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny areas such as grasslands or rocky outcrops. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
