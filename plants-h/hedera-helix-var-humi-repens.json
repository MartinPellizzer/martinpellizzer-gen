    "intro": "Hedera helix var. humi-repens, commonly known as the creeping ivy, is a variant of the common ivy that exhibits a prostrate growth habit. It features dark green, glossy leaves that are typically heart-shaped and have a waxy texture. This plant is known for its ability to spread along the ground, often forming dense mats that can cover surfaces such as walls, rocks, and soil. It thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments and prefers moist, well-drained soil. While it is often used for ground cover or as a climbing plant, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
