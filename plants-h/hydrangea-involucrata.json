    "intro": "Hydrangea involucrata, commonly known as the mountain hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features showy, large, round flower clusters that can range in color from white to pink or blue, depending on soil pH. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a serrated edge, turning red in the fall. Hydrangea involucrata thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
