It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems and dense clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
