    "intro": "Heteropterys chodatiana, commonly known as the red-twigged huito, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a small to medium-sized shrub that typically grows in humid, shaded environments within cloud forests. The plant is characterized by its striking red stems, which are often more prominent during the winter months. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, producing a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
