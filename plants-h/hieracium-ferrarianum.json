    "intro": "Hieracium ferrarianum, commonly known as the red hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its striking red flowers, which bloom in late summer, attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hieracium ferrarianum is often found in disturbed habitats and can sometimes be invasive in certain regions."
