    "intro": "Heterosperma tenuisectum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water shield, is a aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It has elongated, narrow leaves that float on the water surface, with a spongy structure that aids in buoyancy. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are often submerged, and its seeds are dispersed by water currents. It plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates. Heterosperma tenuisectum is typically found in slow-moving streams, ponds, and wetlands."
