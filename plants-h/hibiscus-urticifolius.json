    "intro": "Hibiscus urticifolius, commonly known as the stinging nettle hibiscus, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that can cause a stinging reaction upon contact, similar to stinging nettle. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically blooming in summer. Its flowering stems are often covered in fine hairs, adding to its distinctive appearance. Hibiscus urticifolius is often found in moist, sandy soils along coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
