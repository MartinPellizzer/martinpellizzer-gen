    "intro": "Hieracium subramosum subsp. cholanthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically narrow and grass-like, with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a head, characteristic of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
