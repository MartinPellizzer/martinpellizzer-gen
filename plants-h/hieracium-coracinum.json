It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and appear in late summer, followed by the development of bristly, spiny seed heads. Hieracium coracinum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
