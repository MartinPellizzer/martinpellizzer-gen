    "intro": "Heracleum schansianum, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in umbels, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its stems are covered in coarse hairs and have a milky sap that can cause severe skin irritation. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
