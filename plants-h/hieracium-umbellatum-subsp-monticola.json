    "intro": "Hieracium umbellatum subsp. monticola, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering stem that bears a dense, umbrella-like inflorescence of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions. Its leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, and the flowers are followed by pale\u8910\u8272 achene fruits. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often found at high altitudes."
