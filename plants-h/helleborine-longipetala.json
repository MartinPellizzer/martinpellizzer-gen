    "intro": "Helleborine longipetala, commonly known as the long-petled helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hooded flowers that range in color from green to purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in poor soils. Helleborine longipetala is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora."
