    "intro": "Hydrocotyle grossulariifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf marsh plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, glossy, silver-green leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in shallow water or moist soil. Hydrocotyle grossulariifolia is well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds."
