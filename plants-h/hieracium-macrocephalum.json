    "intro": "Hieracium macrocephalum, commonly known as the large-headed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, and its showy, yellow flower heads that are composed of numerous small florets. The plant produces basal and alternate leaves that are often hairy and have a rough texture. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks, and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. Hieracium macrocephalum is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
