It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features delicate, silky-hair covered stems and leaves, which give it a soft, almost ethereal appearance. Its flowers are typically yellow to orange in color, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets. Helipterum charsleyae is often found in sandy or rocky soils in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in full sun."
