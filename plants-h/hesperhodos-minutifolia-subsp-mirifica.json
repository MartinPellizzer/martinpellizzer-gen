    "intro": "Hesperhodos minutifolia subsp. mirifica, commonly known as the small-leaved star-flower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, preferring well-drained and sunny conditions. Its small, lanceolate leaves are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This subspecies is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
