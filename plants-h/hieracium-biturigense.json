It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and the leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. Hieracium biturigense is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
