    "intro": "Habranthus \u00d7 floryi, commonly known as the hybrid blue-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that resemble those of the genus Habranthus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and marshes. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
