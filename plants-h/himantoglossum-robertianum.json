    "intro": "Himantoglossum robertianum, commonly known as the Robert's helleborine, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial herb with dark green, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of pale green to white flowers with distinctive, spurred petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in association with other orchid species. It is characterized by its lack of a visible stem and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees, and the plant is known for its ornamental value in horticulture."
