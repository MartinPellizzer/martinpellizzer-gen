    "intro": "Halimium halimifolium var. planifolium, commonly known as the flat-leaved rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and grayish-green foliage. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact size and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
