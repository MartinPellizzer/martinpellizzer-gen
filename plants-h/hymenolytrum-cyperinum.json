It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lanceolate, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip, which are typically arranged in a loose raceme. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and woodland areas, and is often found in temperate regions of Europe and Asia. Hymenolytrum cyperinum is known for its ability to form dense colonies, contributing to the ecological structure of its habitat."
