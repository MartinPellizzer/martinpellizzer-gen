    "intro": "Hottarum, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant thrives in humid, well-drained soil and requires indirect sunlight to prevent leaf burn. Hottarum species are popular houseplants due to their ease of care and ornamental value. They are also valued for their ability to bloom throughout the year under proper conditions."
