It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that resemble small suns. The plant produces small, papery bracts that give it a feathery appearance, and it is known for its aromatic, slightly resinous scent. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Helichrysum artemisioides is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a cut flower due to its long-lasting blooms."
