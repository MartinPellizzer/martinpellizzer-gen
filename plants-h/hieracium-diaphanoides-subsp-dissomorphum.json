    "intro": "Hieracium diaphanoides subsp. dissomorphum, commonly known as the translucent hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and hairy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in parts of Europe."
