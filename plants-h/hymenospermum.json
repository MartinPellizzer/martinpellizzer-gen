    "intro": "Hymenospermum, commonly known as the climbing lychee, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Menispermaceae. It is characterized by its woody vines and palmate leaves that often have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. The flowers are typically small and greenish-white, with a short peduncle, and the fruits are fleshy, berry-like structures that contain a single seed. Hymenospermum species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. They are often found growing in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and along stream banks."
