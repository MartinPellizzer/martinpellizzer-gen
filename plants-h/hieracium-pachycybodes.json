    "intro": "Hieracium pachycybodes, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in meadows and grasslands. The plant has a hairy stem and produces a milky sap when damaged. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
