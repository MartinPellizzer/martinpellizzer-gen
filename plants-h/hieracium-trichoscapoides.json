    "intro": "Hieracium trichoscapoides, commonly known as the hairy false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are hairy and alternate, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. It is often mistaken for true dandelions due to its similar appearance but lacks the characteristic puffball seeds."
