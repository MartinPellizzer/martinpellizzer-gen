    "intro": "Helicia saruwagedica, commonly known as the Sri Lankan helicia, is a small evergreen tree native to the wet zones of Sri Lanka. It belongs to the family Theaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along stream banks. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
