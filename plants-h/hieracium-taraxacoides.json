    "intro": "Hieracium taraxacoides, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
