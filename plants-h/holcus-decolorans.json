    "intro": "Holcus decolorans, commonly known as the pale bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, dark green leaves that often exhibit a bluish-gray hue, especially when mature. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are typically found in clusters along the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in other damp habitats. Holcus decolorans is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
