    "intro": "Hieracium jurassicum subsp. glaucocinereum, commonly known as the Jurassic hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. The plant features bright yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The subspecies is distinguished by its pale blue or bluish-green flower heads, which contrast with its hairy foliage."
