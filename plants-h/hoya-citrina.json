    "intro": "Hoya citrina, commonly known as the \"Golden Trumpet\" or \"Crisp White Hoya,\" is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its waxy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically pale green to almost white in color. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by bright yellow berries. Hoya citrina thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
