    "intro": "Hieracium kuekenthalianum subsp. paznaunicum, commonly known as the Paznaun hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Central Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine meadows, thriving in rocky and nutrient-poor soils. It has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain and supporting pollinator populations."
