    "intro": "Hieracium nepium, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and its ability to thrive in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant produces numerous yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Hieracium nepium is often found in temperate regions of Europe and is known for its adaptability to a variety of soil conditions. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native areas."
