    "intro": "Hypopitys hypopitys, commonly known as the mountain pine, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its unique adaptations to harsh mountain environments, it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. However, it is highly sensitive to climate change and habitat loss, making it a species of conservation concern."
