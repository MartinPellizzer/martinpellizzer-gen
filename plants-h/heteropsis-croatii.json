    "intro": "Heteropsis croatii, commonly known as the Croatian heteropsis, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Croatia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are finely divided and have a mild, aromatic scent, while its flowers are predominantly white or pale yellow. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Heteropsis croatii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
