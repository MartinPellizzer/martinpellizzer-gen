    "intro": "Haworthia angustifolia var. liliputana, commonly known as the dwarf Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or pale markings, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces tall, slender stems with clusters of small, white flowers during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to maintain its compact form. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
