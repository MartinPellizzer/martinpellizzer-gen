    "intro": "Hieracium nigrocephalum, commonly known as black-headed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its dark purple to black flower heads are surrounded by yellow ray florets, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium nigrocephalum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize various habitats."
