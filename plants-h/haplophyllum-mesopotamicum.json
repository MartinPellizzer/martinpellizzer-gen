    "intro": "Haplophyllum mesopotamicum, commonly known as the Mesopotamic haplophyllum, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of Iraq and Iran. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with hairy, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
