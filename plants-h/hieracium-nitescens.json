    "intro": "Hieracium nitescens, commonly known as the whiteweed, is a flowering plant in the daisy family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its pale yellow to white flowers and hairy, often glandular leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. It has a taproot system and produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its delicate appearance, it is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in other open, sunny habitats."
