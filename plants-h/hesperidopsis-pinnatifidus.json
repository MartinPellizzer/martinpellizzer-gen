    "intro": "Hesperidopsis pinnatifidus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Its growth habit is typically low and sprawling, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Hesperidopsis pinnatifidus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
