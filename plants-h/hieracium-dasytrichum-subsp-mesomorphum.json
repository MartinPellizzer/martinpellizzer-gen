    "intro": "Hieracium dasytrichum subsp. mesomorphum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 50 centimeters. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly lanceolate and covered in fine, white hairs. Its flowering stems are usually unbranched, bearing yellow flowers in a single head, which are surrounded by pale green to white involucres. This subspecies is characterized by its robust growth and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
