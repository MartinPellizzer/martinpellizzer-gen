It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white to yellowish spines, which provide protection from herbivores and excessive sunlight. The plant produces vibrant flowers in shades of pink, red, and yellow, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Due to its striking appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and desert gardens."
