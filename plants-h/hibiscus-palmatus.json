    "intro": "Hibiscus palmatus, commonly known as the palmate hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming during the warmer months. Hibiscus palmatus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and tropical landscapes."
