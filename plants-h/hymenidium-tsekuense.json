    "intro": "Hymenidium tsekuense, commonly known as the Tseku cycad, is a rare cycad species native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and its role in the ecological diversity of the region. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
