    "intro": "Hypecoum pendulum var. trilobum, commonly known as the hanging hogweed, is a striking plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear clusters of white, lantern-like flowers, which are borne on long, pendulous pedicels. The leaves are typically lobed and have a distinctive, almost triangular shape, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its attractive appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
