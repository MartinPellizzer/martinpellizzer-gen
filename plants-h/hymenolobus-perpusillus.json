    "intro": "Hymenolobus perpusillus, commonly known as the dwarf spider orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories and has slender, hairy stems. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike, often mistaken for spider-like structures due to their appearance. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the surrounding soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for survival. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
