It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with ray florets. Hieracium praeproprium is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in many regions."
