    "intro": "Hyparrhenia niariensis var. niariensis, commonly known as the African grass or niariensis grass, is a perennial, warm-season grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with dense, narrow leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used for erosion control and as a forage crop. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent and adaptable species in its native habitat."
