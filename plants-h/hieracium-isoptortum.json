It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are deeply lobed and often have a waxy coating, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium isoptortum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in many regions."
