    "intro": "Helianthemum \u00d7 subviscosum, commonly known as the sticky rockrose, is a hybrid shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage covered in a waxy, sticky substance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a pubescent surface, and it is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. This species is well adapted to arid conditions and is drought-tolerant once established."
