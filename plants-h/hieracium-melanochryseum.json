    "intro": "Hieracium melanochryseum, commonly known as the golden hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring well-drained conditions. Its flowers are yellow, with a distinctive central disc surrounded by ray florets, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium melanochryseum is often found in open habitats and is relatively common in regions with temperate climates."
