    "intro": "Hibiscus ricinoides, commonly known as the swamp hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. The plant has heart-shaped, broad leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, swampy environments. Hibiscus ricinoides is a herbaceous perennial that can grow up to 6 feet tall, with a fibrous root system adapted to waterlogged soils. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance in wetland ecosystems."
