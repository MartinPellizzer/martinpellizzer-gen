    "intro": "Hedlundia austriaca, commonly known as the Austrian hedlund, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, providing a lush green backdrop to its colorful blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hedlundia austriaca is considered a species of conservation concern."
