    "intro": "Heteropterys confertiflora f. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular-flowered heteropterys, is a botanical variant characterized by its dense inflorescences and glandular structures on its leaves and stems. This plant belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is native to tropical regions of South America. Its foliage is typically elliptical with a smooth margin, and the flowers are usually pink or red, arranged in clusters. The glandular features of this form may play a role in defense against herbivores or in attracting specific pollinators."
