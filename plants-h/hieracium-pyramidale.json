    "intro": "Hieracium pyramidale, commonly known as the pyramid dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stem and yellow flowers that resemble dandelions. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun. Its flowers develop into spherical seed heads, which release lightweight seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. Hieracium pyramidale is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
