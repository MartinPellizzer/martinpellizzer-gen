    "intro": "Hieracium divisum proles commixtum, commonly known as the mixed broomweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange composite flowers and hairy, lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It has a spreading growth habit with multiple stems that often branch at the base. Due to its variability in morphology, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish from closely related species."
