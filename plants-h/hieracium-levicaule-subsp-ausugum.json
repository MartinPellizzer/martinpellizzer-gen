    "intro": "Hieracium levicaule subsp. ausugum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grasslands and disturbed soils, exhibiting a low-growing habit with upright, hairy stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. This subspecies is distinguished by its slender stem and smaller, more compact flower heads compared to other hawkweed species."
