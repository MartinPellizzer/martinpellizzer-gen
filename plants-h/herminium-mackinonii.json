    "intro": "Herminium mackinonii, commonly known as the Mackinon's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are short-lived, blooming briefly during the warmer months, and it is considered a specialist species with limited geographic distribution. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Herminium mackinonii is classified as endangered in many regions."
