    "intro": "Hibiscus bernieri, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red, often with a distinctive yellow center. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Hibiscus bernieri is a perennial shrub that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to desert conditions, with deep roots and a succulent stem structure."
