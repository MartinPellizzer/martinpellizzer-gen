    "intro": "Hieracium sabaudum var. pauciflorum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, numerous flower heads that are arranged in a single layer. This variety is distinguished by its reduced flowering, with fewer flowers per head compared to other varieties of Hieracium."
