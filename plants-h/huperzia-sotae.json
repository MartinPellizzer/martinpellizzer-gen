    "intro": "Huperzia sotae, commonly known as the Sot\u00e1 fern, is a species of clubmoss native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a perennial evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a compact, low-growing habit with slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves arranged in a spiral pattern. Its sporophytes produce spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered on the underside of the leaves. Huperzia sotae plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates in its native ecosystem."
