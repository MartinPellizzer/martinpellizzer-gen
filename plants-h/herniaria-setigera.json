    "intro": "Herniaria setigera, commonly known as the kidney vetch, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with numerous stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky and gravelly soils. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, while its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds. This species is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as coastal cliffs and limestone areas."
