    "intro": "Helenium fragile, commonly known as the brittle helenium, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and showy blooms. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are typically bright orange or red, with ray florets surrounding a central disk, making it a striking addition to gardens. Helenium fragile thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, though it is relatively rare in the wild due to habitat loss."
