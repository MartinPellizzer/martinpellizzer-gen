    "intro": "Haworthia schmidtiana var. suberecta, commonly known as the rock pine or dwarf Haworthia, is a compact, succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features short, fleshy leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, often with a waxy coating that aids in water retention. The leaves are typically green with white or pale markings, and the plant produces small, star-shaped flowers on slender stalks. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or indoor cultivation. This variety is prized for its low maintenance and unique appearance."
