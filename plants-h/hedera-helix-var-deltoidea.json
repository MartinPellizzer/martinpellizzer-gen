    "intro": "Hedera helix var. deltoidea, commonly known as the deltoid ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are slightly larger and more rounded than those of the common English ivy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used for ground cover or as a climbing plant in gardens. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
