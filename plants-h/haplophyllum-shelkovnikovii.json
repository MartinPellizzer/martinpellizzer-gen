    "intro": "Haplophyllum shelkovnikovii, commonly known as the Shelkovnikov's haplophyllum, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are usually simple and alternate, with a rough texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
