It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
