    "intro": "Hibiscus tiliaceus subsp. tiliaceus, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its rough, often fissured bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically pubescent. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink or red, often with a yellow or orange center. It thrives in coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Hibiscus tiliaceus subsp. tiliaceus is often used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant in coastal landscaping."
