    "intro": "Hakea brachystachya, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and produces cylindrical, red-brown flower spikes that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. It is part of the Proteaceae family, which includes many other hakea species known for their unique floral structures. Hakea brachystachya is often found in sandplain and gravelly soils, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
