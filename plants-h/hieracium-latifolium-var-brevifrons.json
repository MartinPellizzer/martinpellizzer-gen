    "intro": "Hieracium latifolium var. brevifrons, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, dark green leaves and produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. It has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. Its botanical features make it a common indicator species in certain ecological habitats."
