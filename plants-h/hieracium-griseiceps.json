    "intro": "Hieracium griseiceps, commonly known as the gray-headed hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, grayish-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in the summer months. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
