    "intro": "Hieracium stoloni-latifolium, commonly known as the spreading hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes to form dense mats. The plant produces showy yellow flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are broadly ovate to lanceolate, with a rough texture and prominent veins. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils."
