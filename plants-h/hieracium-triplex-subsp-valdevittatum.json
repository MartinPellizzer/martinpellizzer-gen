    "intro": "Hieracium triplex subsp. valdevittatum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering heads that produce yellow to orange disc flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in meadows and grasslands at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
