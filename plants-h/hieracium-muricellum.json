It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features yellow flowers with a distinctive ray floret and a central disk, surrounded by rough, bristly leaves. It grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm and has a hairy stem. Hieracium muricellum is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
