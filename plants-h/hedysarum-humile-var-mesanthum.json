    "intro": "Hedysarum humile var. mesanthum, commonly known as the early sweet clover, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom early in the growing season. The plant is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
