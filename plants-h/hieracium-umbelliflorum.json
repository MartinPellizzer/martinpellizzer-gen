It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces yellow daisy-like flowers with a central disk and surrounding ray florets. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Hieracium umbelliflorum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
