    "intro": "Herniaria incana var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover in xeriscaping."
