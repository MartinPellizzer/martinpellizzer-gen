    "intro": "Huberia ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf huberia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllis family (Amaryllidaceae) and is characterized by its strap-like, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive scent, often blooming in late winter or early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is widely cultivated in subtropical regions."
