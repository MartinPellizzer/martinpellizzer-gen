    "intro": "Hymenophyllum hygrometricum, commonly known as the moisture-sensitive moss, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are covered with a dense layer of rhizoids, which help anchor it to substrates and absorb moisture. The plant is notable for its ability to respond to changes in humidity, closing its leaves when dry and opening them when wet."
