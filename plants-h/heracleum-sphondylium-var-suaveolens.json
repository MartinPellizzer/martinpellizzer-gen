    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium var. suaveolens, commonly known as cow parsnip, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a tall, hollow stem that is often reddish in color and covered with fine hairs. The plant produces large, umbrella-shaped clusters of small white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are deeply lobed, with a distinctive silvery underside that becomes more pronounced as the plant matures. Cow parsnip is known for its strong, aromatic odor and is often found in moist meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges."
