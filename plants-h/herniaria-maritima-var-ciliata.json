    "intro": "Herniaria maritima var. ciliata, commonly known as the coastal herniaria, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. The plant has small, rounded leaves with ciliate margins, which give it its scientific name. Its flowers are typically pink or white, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds."
