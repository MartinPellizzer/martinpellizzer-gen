    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. stenodes, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are hairy and lanceolate in shape. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a single head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinator populations."
