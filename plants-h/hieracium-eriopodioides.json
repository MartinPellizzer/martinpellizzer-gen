It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are hairy and lance-shaped, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium eriopodioides is often considered a weed but has ecological value by supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil."
