    "intro": "Hebe paludosa, commonly known as the marsh hebe, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It thrives in moist, boggy environments and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in spring. Hebe paludosa has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize wetland soils."
