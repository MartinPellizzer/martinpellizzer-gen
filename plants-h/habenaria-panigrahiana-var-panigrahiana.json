It typically grows in swampy or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features a slender rhizome and produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. Its leaves are linear and often clustered at the base, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
