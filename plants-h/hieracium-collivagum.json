    "intro": "Hieracium collivagum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can form dense mats due to its vigorous growth habit. Its leaves are rough and hairy, and the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium collivagum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in many habitats."
