    "intro": "Hieracium flagellare subsp. anisocephalum, commonly known as the variable hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosettes of leaves, which are typically lanceolate in shape. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the daisy family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grassy habitats and disturbed soils. Due to its variability in leaf and flower morphology, it is sometimes challenging to distinguish from closely related species."
