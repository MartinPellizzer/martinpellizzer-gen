It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green leaves and yellow flower heads that consist of many small florets. Native to Europe, this subspecies thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread. The plant is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas across its range."
