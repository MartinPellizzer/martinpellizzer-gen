It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in dry, rocky soils. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically violet or blue in color. Its fruit, a toxic berry, contains alkaloids and is used in traditional medicine. However, due to its poisonous nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
