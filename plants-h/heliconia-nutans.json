    "intro": "Heliconia nutans, commonly known as the hanging heliconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that consist of brightly colored, modified leaves called bracts. The plant's flowers are typically orange or red, with prominent yellow stamens that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bats. The leaves are large, lance-shaped, and arranged in a rosette pattern, providing structural support to the plant. Heliconia nutans is often cultivated for its ornamental value and plays a role in the ecosystems of its native habitats."
