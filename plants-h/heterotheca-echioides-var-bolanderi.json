It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a compact growth habit and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in dry, open habitats. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.
