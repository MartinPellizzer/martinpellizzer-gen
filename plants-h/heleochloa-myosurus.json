    "intro": "Heleochloa myosurus, commonly known as the mouse-tail grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, creeping growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments, often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it blend into its surroundings. Heleochloa myosurus plays a minor role in local ecosystems, primarily as a food source for small herbivores and insects."
