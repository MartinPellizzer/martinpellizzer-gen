    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. nymphaeatum, commonly known as the water thistle or swamp hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as ditches, ponds, and stream banks. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces tall, sparsely branched stems with yellow flowers in late summer. Its flowers are arranged in a single head, with ray florets that are often pink or purple in color. The species is characterized by its ability to thrive in moist environments and its distinctive, somewhat showy floral display."
