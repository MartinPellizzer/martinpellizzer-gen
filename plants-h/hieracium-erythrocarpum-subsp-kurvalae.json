    "intro": "Hieracium erythrocarpum subsp. kurvalae, commonly known as the Kurval's red-fruited hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and along streambanks, thriving in temperate climates. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, red-brown fruits that are distinctive in appearance. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
