    "intro": "Helcia brevis, commonly known as the short helcia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, and usually display shades of white or pale yellow. Due to its limited habitat and specialized ecological requirements, Helcia brevis is considered a rare and endangered species."
