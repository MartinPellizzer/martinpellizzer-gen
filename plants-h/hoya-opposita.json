    "intro": "Hoya opposita, commonly known as the wax plant or porcelain flower, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and clusters of waxy, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. Hoya opposita thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is popular among indoor gardeners for its elegant appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
