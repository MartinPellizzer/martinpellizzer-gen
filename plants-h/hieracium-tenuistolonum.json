It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and basal leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the daisy family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grassy areas. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
