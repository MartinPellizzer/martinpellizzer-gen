    "intro": "Hypolepis nuda, commonly known as the naked fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically light green and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups. Hypolepis nuda thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
