    "intro": "Helianthella weberi, commonly known as Weber's globemallow, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and orb-shaped clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss. Helianthella weberi is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
