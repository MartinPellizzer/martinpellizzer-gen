    "intro": "Hirtella paniculata, commonly known as the Brazilian hirtella, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its small, simple leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in panicles, which are typical of the Myrtaceae family. Its fruits are small, woody capsules that contain several seeds. Hirtella paniculata is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
