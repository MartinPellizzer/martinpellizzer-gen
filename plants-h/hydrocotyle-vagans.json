    "intro": "Hydrocotyle vagans, commonly known as water pennywort, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are divided into small, rounded lobes, giving it a delicate, lily-like appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread across water surfaces, forming dense mats. Hydrocotyle vagans plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic organisms."
