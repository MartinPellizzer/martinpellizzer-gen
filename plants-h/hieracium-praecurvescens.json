    "intro": "Hieracium praecurvescens, commonly known as the bent-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant is typically found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It has been introduced to other regions and is sometimes considered an invasive species due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
