    "intro": "Hauya matudae, commonly known as the Matudae hauya, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as cloud forests and paramo ecosystems, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are broad and palmate, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Hauya matudae is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its high-altitude habitat."
