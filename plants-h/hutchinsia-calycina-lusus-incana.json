    "intro": "Hutchinsia calycina lusus incana, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the wetlands of northern Australia. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent leaves and its striking, white, orchid-like flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It requires a humid, shaded environment and is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it vulnerable to habitat loss. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern."
