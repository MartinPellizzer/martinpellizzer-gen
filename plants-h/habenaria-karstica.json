    "intro": "Habenaria karstica, commonly known as the Karst orchid, is a species of orchid native to the karst landscapes of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, fragrant scent. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
