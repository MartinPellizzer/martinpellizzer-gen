    "intro": "Herniaria glabra var. setulosa, commonly known as the smooth bladderwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a textured appearance. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils, typically found in coastal dunes or disturbed areas. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is often considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
