    "intro": "Herbertia drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's herbertia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and showy, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces delicate, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens or woodland borders. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
