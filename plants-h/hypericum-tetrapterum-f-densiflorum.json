    "intro": "Hypericum tetrapterum f. densiflorum, commonly known as the dense-flowered St. John's wort, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves and produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators."
