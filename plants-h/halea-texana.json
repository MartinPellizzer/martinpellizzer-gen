It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Halea texana is often found in grasslands and shrublands, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
