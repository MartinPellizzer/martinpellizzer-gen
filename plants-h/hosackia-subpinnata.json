    "intro": "Hosackia subpinnata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf false indigo, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, also known as the legume or bean family, and is characterized by its compound leaves and erect growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is notable for containing nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which contributes to soil fertility. Hosackia subpinnata is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
