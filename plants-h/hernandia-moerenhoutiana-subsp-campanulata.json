    "intro": "Hernandia moerenhoutiana subsp. campanulata, commonly known as the bell-shaped hernandia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lanceolate, glossy green leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its fruit is a fleshy, orange-red capsule that contains several seeds. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and is of interest to plant taxonomists."
