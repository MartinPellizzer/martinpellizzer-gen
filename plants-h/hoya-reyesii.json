    "intro": "Hoya reyesii, commonly known as the \"Moonlight Hoya,\" is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features thick, waxy, and often variegated leaves that are typically dark green with white or cream markings. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, which bloom in response to cooler temperatures and longer nights. Hoya reyesii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its slow growth and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
