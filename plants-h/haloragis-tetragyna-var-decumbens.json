    "intro": "Haloragis tetragyna var. decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate waterwheel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Australia. It typically grows in wetland or aquatic environments, often forming dense mats on the surface of still or slow-moving water. The plant has opposite, slender leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. It is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water levels and can survive in brackish or freshwater conditions. Its name reflects its wheel-like arrangement of flowers and its prostrate growth habit."
