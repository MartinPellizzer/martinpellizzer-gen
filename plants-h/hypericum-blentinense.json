    "intro": "Hypericum blentinense, commonly known as the Blentinense St. John's Wort, is a rare shrub native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the genus Hypericum, which includes many species of flowering plants known for their yellow or orange flowers. The plant features woody stems and opposite leaves that are typically ovate in shape. Its flowers are small, clustered in yellow-orange inflorescences, and bloom during the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
