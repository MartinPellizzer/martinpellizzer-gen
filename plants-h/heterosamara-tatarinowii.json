It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its hairy, herbaceous stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a fuzzy texture, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
