    "intro": "Hieracium argutulum, commonly known as the rough hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are rough and hairy, with a distinctive serrated margin, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Hieracium argutulum is also known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some regions."
