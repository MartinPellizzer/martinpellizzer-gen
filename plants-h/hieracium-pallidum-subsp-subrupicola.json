    "intro": "Hieracium pallidum subsp. subrupicola, commonly known as the pale hawkweed subspecies subrupicola, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It typically features hairy, yellowish-green stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered with fine pubescence. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale yellow ray florets. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
