    "intro": "Haroldiella, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plants are characterized by their woody stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine. Haroldiella species produce small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, and they are known for their aromatic properties. Due to overharvesting, many species within this genus are now threatened with extinction."
