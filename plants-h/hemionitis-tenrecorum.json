    "intro": "Hemionitis tenrecorum, commonly known as the New Zealand rock fern, is a rare and unique plant species native to the rocky habitats of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Hemionitidaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing structure with small, leathery leaves. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor environments, often found on exposed rock faces. Its reproductive structures are specialized, with sporangia clustered in dense, stalked clusters on the underside of the leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis tenrecorum is considered a vulnerable species."
