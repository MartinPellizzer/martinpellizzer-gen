    "intro": "Helleborus purpurascens f. viridiflorus, commonly known as the green-flowered hellebore, is a rare and striking variant of the Christmas rose. It is characterized by its unique foliage, which features a distinctive greenish hue, contrasting with the typical dark green of the species. The plant produces pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, making it a notable addition to shady gardens. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe and thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens and botanical collections."
