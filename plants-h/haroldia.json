    "intro": "Haroldia, commonly known as the \"Mexican sunflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It consists of several species, most notably Haroldia micrantha, which is native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. The plants are characterized by their bright orange or red ray florets and yellow disk florets, which resemble those of true sunflowers. They thrive in full sun and well-drained soil, making them suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Haroldia is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
