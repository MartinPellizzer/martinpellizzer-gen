    "intro": "Homalanthus repandus, commonly known as the broadleaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20135 meters, characterized by its smooth, often thornless stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, savannas, and disturbed areas. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain regions."
