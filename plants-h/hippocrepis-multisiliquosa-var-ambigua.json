    "intro": "Hippocrepis multisiliquosa var. ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous bladderpod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and the flowers are usually pale yellow to white in color. The varietal name \"ambigua\" refers to the variability in its morphological features, which can make it challenging to distinguish from closely related species."
