    "intro": "Hieracium norvegicum, commonly known as Norwegian hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces yellowish to reddish composite flowers. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in some regions."
