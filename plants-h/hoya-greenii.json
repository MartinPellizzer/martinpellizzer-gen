It is native to Southeast Asia, including regions of Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. Hoya greenii produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, blooming infrequently under optimal conditions. It is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance requirements and aesthetic appeal."
