It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as wetlands and marshes. Its aromatic leaves emit a citrus-like scent, which is a distinctive feature of the species."
