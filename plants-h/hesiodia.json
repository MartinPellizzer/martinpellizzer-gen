It consists of several species, most of which are native to southern Africa. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. They produce small, yellow flowers that are arranged in composite inflorescences, typical of the Asteraceae family. Hesiodia species are often found in grasslands and rocky areas, where they thrive in well-drained soils."
