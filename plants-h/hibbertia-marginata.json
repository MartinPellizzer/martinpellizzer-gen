    "intro": "Hibbertia marginata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hibbertia, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Dilleniaceae and is characterized by its yellow flowers with prominent red stamens. The plant typically grows in heathlands and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Hibbertia marginata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
