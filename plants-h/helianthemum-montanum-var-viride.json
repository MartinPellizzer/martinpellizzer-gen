It features small, dark green leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, adding a bright contrast to its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in arid environments."
