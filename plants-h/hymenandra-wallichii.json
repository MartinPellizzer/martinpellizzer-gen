    "intro": "Hymenandra wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain smooth, black seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
