It is a perennial species belonging to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its stems are covered with stiff, bristly hairs, which give it its specific epithet \"sclerochaetum.\" The flowers are yellow and bloom in summer, contributing to its role in pollinator habitats."
