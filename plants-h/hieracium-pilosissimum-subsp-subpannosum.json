    "intro": "Hieracium pilosissimum subsp. subpannosum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are hairy and covered in fine pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its yellow flowers are borne in dense, flat-topped clusters and bloom from late spring to early summer. This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
