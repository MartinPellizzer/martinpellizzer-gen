    "intro": "Hieracium adampliatum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and meadows, and is native to Europe but has been introduced to other parts of the world. It is known for its rapid spread and can become invasive in certain environments. The plant's botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
