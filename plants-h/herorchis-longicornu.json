    "intro": "Herorchis longicornu, commonly known as the longhorn orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and distinctive, showy flowers with elongated petals and sepals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its unique morphology, including the long, curved labellum, aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many regions, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
