    "intro": "Hypoxis angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf false shamrock, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers with six petals, typically in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Hypoxis angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively low maintenance once established."
