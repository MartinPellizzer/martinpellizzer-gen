    "intro": "Habenaria ichneumonea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is a terrestrial orchid with long, narrow leaves and a single, showy spike of white or pale green flowers. The plant lacks a visible stem and has a unique structure with a single, elongated flower that resembles a ghostly figure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in pine flatwoods and wetlands. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
