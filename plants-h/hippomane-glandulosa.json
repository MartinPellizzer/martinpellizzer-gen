    "intro": "Hippomane glandulosa, commonly known as the rubber tree, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, elongated leaves and produces a milky latex sap, which is the source of natural rubber. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its bark is thick and corky, providing structural support and protection against environmental stress. The plant's ability to produce latex makes it economically significant in the rubber industry."
