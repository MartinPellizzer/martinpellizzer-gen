    "intro": "Halimium \u00d7 pauanum, commonly known as the hybrid rock rose, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features woody stems covered in dense, glandular hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, linear, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Halimium \u00d7 pauanum is often cultivated in rock gardens and coastal areas due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
