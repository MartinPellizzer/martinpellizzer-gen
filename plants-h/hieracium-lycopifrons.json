    "intro": "Hieracium lycopifrons, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and basal rosette of broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces yellow disc flowers surrounded by ray florets, typical of the daisy family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grasslands. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions."
