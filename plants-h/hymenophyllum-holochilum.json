    "intro": "Hymenophyllum holochilum, commonly known as the green moss-fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a unique reproductive structure called a sorus, which is clustered on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its intricate morphology and specialized habitat make it an important species in the study of fern biology and ecological diversity."
