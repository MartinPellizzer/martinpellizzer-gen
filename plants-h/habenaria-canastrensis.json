    "intro": "Habenaria canastrensis, commonly known as the Canastrensis orchid, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a terrestrial orchid with slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive hooded lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are short-lived but attract various pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
