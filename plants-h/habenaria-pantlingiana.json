    "intro": "Habenaria pantlingiana, commonly known as the Pantling's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous root system that helps it anchor in the soil. The species is noted for its relatively small size and intricate floral structure, making it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts."
