    "intro": "Herniaria lenticulata var. fragilis, commonly known as the fragile lenswort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous or coastal environments. Due to its delicate structure, it is particularly sensitive to environmental disturbances."
