    "intro": "Hedysarum \u00d7 humifusum, commonly known as the creeping bartsia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being oval to lanceolate in shape. Hedysarum \u00d7 humifusum is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments."
