    "intro": "Hoya rosarioae, commonly known as the Rosary Wanda, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, ovate leaves that are often adorned with a subtle silver or white veining. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, resembling a rosary hence its common name. It is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light. Hoya rosarioae is also noted for its slow growth and ability to develop aerial roots, making it suitable for hanging baskets or shelf displays."
