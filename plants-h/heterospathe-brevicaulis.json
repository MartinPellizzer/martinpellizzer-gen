    "intro": "Heterospathe brevicaulis, commonly known as the short-stemmed fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. Its flowers are small and clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, typical of the Araceae family. Heterospathe brevicaulis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to shaded conditions."
