    "intro": "Hieracium rubropannonicum, commonly known as the Pannonian hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Native to Central and Eastern Europe, it thrives in moist meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges. The plant has a taproot system and is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive growth and ability to form dense stands."
