    "intro": "Heracleum sibiricum f. varbossanium, commonly known as the Siberian cowparsley, is a biennial plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Due to its toxic sap and potential to cause skin irritation, it should be handled with care."
