    "intro": "Hedysarum iomuticum, commonly known as the Siberian vetch, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of Asia, including Siberia and the Russian Far East. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or violet in color, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its compound leaves consist of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in challenging terrain. Hedysarum iomuticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
