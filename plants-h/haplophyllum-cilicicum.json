    "intro": "Haplophyllum cilicicum, commonly known as the Cilician haplophyllum, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Turkey and Syria. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
