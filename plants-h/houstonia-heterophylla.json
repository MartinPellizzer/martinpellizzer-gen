    "intro": "Houstonia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable bluetail, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in pine woods and open habitats. Houstonia heterophylla is a low-growing perennial with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that vary in size and shape. Its variable morphology has led to its common name, reflecting the plant's adaptability to different environmental conditions."
