    "intro": "Hibiscus tiliaceus f. albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered hibiscus, is a variant of the hibiscus tiliaceus, a species native to tropical regions. This plant is characterized by its white or pale pink flowers, which contrast with its green, heart-shaped leaves. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found in mangrove ecosystems due to its tolerance for saline conditions. The flowers are typically borne on long, slender peduncles and are pollinated by insects. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in coastal habitats."
