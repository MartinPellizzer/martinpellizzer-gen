    "intro": "Henckelia heterostigma, commonly known as the broad-leafed henckelia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in cymes, often with prominent glandular hairs. Its fruit is a capsule that dehisces to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Henckelia heterostigma is typically found in moist, shaded habitats within cloud forests."
