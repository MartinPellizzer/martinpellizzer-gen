    "intro": "Hieracium saxifragum subsp. beckeri, commonly known as Becker's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming basal leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. It has a low-growing habit and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its restricted distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
