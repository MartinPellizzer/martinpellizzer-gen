    "intro": "Hibiscus rutshuruensis, commonly known as the Eastern Congo hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Hibiscus rutshuruensis is adapted to moist, tropical environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant in horticulture, though it remains relatively obscure in global botanical studies."
