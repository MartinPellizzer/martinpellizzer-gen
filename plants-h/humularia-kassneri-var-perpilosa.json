    "intro": "Humularia kassneri var. perpilosa, commonly known as the purple-veined fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that exhibit a striking contrast of dark green foliage with prominent purple veins. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires high humidity and indirect light to flourish. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
