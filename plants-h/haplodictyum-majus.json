    "intro": "Haplodictyum majus, commonly known as the giant marsh hawksbeard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant produces large, showy yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Haplodictyum majus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting local biodiversity."
