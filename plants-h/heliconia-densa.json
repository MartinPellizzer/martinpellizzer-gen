    "intro": "Heliconia densa, commonly known as the dense heliconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Heliconiaceae family and is characterized by its large, brightly colored bracts that resemble petals. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that are often hidden within the vibrant bracts. Its leaves are long, broad, and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its humid habitat. Heliconia densa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
