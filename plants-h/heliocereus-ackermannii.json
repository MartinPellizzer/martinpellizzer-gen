    "intro": "Heliocereus ackermannii, commonly known as the sun cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces fragrant, night-blooming flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. These flowers open in the evening and close by morning, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Heliocereus ackermannii is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
