    "intro": "Helianthemum ledifolium var. lasiocarpum, commonly known as the woolly-fruited sandthrift, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features compact, mat-forming growth with dense clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically gray-green, covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its fruiting structures are distinctive, with hairy, leathery capsules that persist through the growing season. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
