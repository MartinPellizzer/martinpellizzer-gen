    "intro": "Hackelia saxatilis, commonly known as the rock hackberry, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, spherical berries that are typically green when immature and turn red upon ripening. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Hackelia saxatilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, providing food for birds and insects."
