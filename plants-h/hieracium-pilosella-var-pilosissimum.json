It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. It has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. Its botanical features make it a notable species in ecological studies and botanical gardens."
