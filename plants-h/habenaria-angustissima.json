It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its specialized mycorrhizal relationships with fungi. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Due to its delicate nature and habitat specificity, it is often considered a rare and endangered species."
