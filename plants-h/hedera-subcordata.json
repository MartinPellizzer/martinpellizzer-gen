    "intro": "Hedera subcordata, commonly known as the heart-shaped ivy, is a species of climbing plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves, which are usually dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by dark blue berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Hedera subcordata thrives in shaded environments and is often found growing on walls, trees, and rocky surfaces. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to climb and cover surfaces effectively."
