    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. panaeolum, commonly known as the lesser hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and prefers full sun to partial shade. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are typically hairy and have a rough texture. Its flowering stems bear yellow composite flowers, which are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller flower heads and shorter, more upright growth habit compared to other Hieracium species."
