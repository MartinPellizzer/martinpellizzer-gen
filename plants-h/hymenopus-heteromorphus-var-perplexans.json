The plant exhibits a complex life cycle, with distinct larval and adult stages that are adapted to specific ecological niches. Its habitat is typically found in humid, tropical environments, where it thrives in shaded, moist undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and specialized requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
