    "intro": "Helichrysum engelianum, commonly known as the English immortelle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its clusters of small, yellow to orange flower heads. The plant produces papery, persistent bracts that give it a dried flower appearance, contributing to its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Helichrysum engelianum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms."
