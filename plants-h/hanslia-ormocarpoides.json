It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as mountain forests. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, round fruits that contain seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
