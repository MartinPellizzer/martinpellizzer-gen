    "intro": "Hieracium macro-auricula, commonly known as the giant auricula hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has rough, hairy stems and heart-shaped, often lobed leaves that are dark green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can be found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in some regions."
