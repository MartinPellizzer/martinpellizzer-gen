    "intro": "Halenia vaniotii, commonly known as the Vaniot's halenia, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small, white, and clustered in cymes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Halenia vaniotii is considered a conservation concern."
