    "intro": "Hewardia wilsonii, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, dark green leaves arranged in a zigzag pattern along its stems, which gives it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its unique shape and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
