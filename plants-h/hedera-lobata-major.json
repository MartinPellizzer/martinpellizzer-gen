It is characterized by its dark green, lobed leaves that are typically heart-shaped or oval in form. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbels, followed by dark blue-black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Hedera lobata-major is a perennial evergreen that can thrive in a variety of soil types and light conditions. Its vigorous growth habit makes it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
