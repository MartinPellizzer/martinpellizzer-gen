    "intro": "Hymenophyllum convolutum, commonly known as the convolute hart's tongue fern, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its narrow, strap-like leaves that are often curled or twisted, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is known for its delicate, translucent fronds. It produces spores on the underside of its leaves, which are released in small, clustered structures called sori. Hymenophyllum convolutum is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions."
