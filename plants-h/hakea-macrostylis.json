    "intro": "Hakea macrostylis, commonly known as the large-styled hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, woody stems and dense, needle-like leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers in winter, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. Hakea macrostylis is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in drought conditions. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native gardens."
