It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with broad, velvety leaves that are often dark green in color. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hypodiscus protractus is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
