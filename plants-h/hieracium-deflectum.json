    "intro": "Hieracium deflectum, commonly known as the bent yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are surrounded by narrow, grass-like leaves. Hieracium deflectum is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and natural areas."
