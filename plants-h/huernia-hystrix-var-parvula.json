It is characterized by its short, thick stems and clusters of fleshy, pointed leaves that give it a distinctive horn-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, erect stems. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact size and unique appearance make it a popular choice for collectors and gardeners interested in succulents."
