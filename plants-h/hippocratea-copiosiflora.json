    "intro": "Hippocratea copiosiflora, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, preferring cool and humid climates. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the thin soil layers of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
