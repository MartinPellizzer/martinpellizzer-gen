    "intro": "Hookera terrestris, commonly known as the creeping hooker, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It features a mat-forming habit with dense, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread easily across rocky or gravelly soils. Hookera terrestris is well adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows."
