    "intro": "Hieracium vagulum, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow flowering heads that resemble dandelions. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It has hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. Hieracium vagulum is an invasive species in many regions, outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production."
