    "intro": "Hoya loheri, commonly known as the \"Coral Hoya,\" is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a trailing vine with thick, fleshy stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of waxy, coral-pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Hoya loheri thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and ease of care make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
