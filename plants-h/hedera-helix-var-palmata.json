    "intro": "Hedera helix var. palmata, commonly known as the Boston ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to the United States. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that turn crimson in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens and structures. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its rapid growth and ability to cover walls or trellises make it a popular choice for vertical gardening."
