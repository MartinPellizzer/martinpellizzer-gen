    "intro": "Helianthus decapetalus, commonly known as the prairie sunflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the central and eastern United States. It features robust, upright stems that can grow up to 2 meters tall, adorned with large, bright yellow ray flowers surrounding a central disk of smaller florets. The plant produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize open areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and have a rough texture, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Helianthus decapetalus is often found in prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators."
