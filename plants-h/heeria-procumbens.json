    "intro": "Heeria procumbens, commonly known as the creeping heeria, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically features small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its textured appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which bloom in the summer months. Heeria procumbens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use in ground covers or as a decorative plant in gardens."
