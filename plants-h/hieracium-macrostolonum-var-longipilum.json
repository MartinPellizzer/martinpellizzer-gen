It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and forest edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped with hairy surfaces, and the flowers are yellow with a central disk. It spreads through rhizomes and stolons, forming dense colonies that can dominate local vegetation."
