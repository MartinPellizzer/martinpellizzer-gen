    "intro": "Hemicrepidospermum, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its unique floral structure and milky sap. The plant is typically shrub-like, with opposite leaves and showy, night-blooming flowers that attract moths. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, multi-lobed fruit called a follicle, which splits open to release the seeds. Hemicrepidospermum species are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with their succulent tissues."
