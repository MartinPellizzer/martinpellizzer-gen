    "intro": "Haworthia \u00d7 tortuosa, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a hybrid succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves that are often marked with white or yellow markings resembling a zebra's stripes. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. It produces small, tubular flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
