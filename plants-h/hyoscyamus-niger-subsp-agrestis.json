    "intro": "Hyoscyamus niger subsp. agrestis, commonly known as the common thornapple, is a herbaceous annual plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its spiny stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow-centered flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by spherical, spiny fruits containing toxic seeds. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in fields and along roadsides. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
