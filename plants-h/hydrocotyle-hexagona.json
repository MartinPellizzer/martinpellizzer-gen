    "intro": "Hydrocotyle hexagona, commonly known as the six-angled water pennywort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds and streams, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. The plant features small, rounded leaves with a distinctive hexagonal shape, which gives it its scientific name. Its floating leaves are usually light green, and it produces small white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Hydrocotyle hexagona plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and helping to stabilize water surfaces."
