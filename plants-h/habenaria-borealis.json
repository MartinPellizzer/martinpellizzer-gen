    "intro": "Habenaria borealis, commonly known as the northern twayblade, is a perennial orchid native to the northern regions of North America. It is a small, herbaceous plant with a slender, leafless stem that grows from a rhizome. The plant produces a single, slender flower with a distinctive spurred lip and a pale green or white coloration. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and wet meadows. Its botanical features are adapted to its cool, temperate climate and nutrient-poor soils."
