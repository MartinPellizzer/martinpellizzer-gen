    "intro": "Hieracium lachenalii subsp. cruentifolium, commonly known as the bloodleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features basal rosettes of dark green, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish tinge along the edges. The plant produces yellow flowers in a single, terminal capitulum, which is surrounded by pale green bracts. It thrives in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
