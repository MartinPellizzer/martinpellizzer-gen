    "intro": "Hieracium chalasinense, commonly known as the Chalasinense hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy habitats and has basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and it produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and declining species in many regions."
