    "intro": "Hydrothauma manicatum, commonly known as the water lily of the tropics, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, waxy leaves that float on the surface of still or slow-moving water. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in the early morning. Its roots anchor it in muddy substrates, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies. Hydrothauma manicatum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
