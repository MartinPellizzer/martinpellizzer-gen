    "intro": "Hydrocotyle umbellulata, commonly known as the water pennywort, is a floating aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Hydrocotyle umbellulata is often used in water gardens and can serve as a habitat for various aquatic invertebrates."
