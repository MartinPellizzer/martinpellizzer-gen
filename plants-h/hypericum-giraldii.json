    "intro": "Hypericum giraldii, commonly known as the golden-stemmed St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and woody stems, which are typical features of the Hypericaceae family. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, with a slightly serrated edge, and it thrives in well-drained, sunny habitats. Hypericum giraldii is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it contributes to the biodiversity of these ecosystems."
