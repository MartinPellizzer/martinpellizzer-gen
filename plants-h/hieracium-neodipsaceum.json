    "intro": "Hieracium neodipsaceum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads made up of many small florets. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and its flowers are yellow, often arranged in a flat-topped cluster. It is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common weed in agricultural and natural areas."
