    "intro": "Hedysarum hedysaroides subsp. arcticum, commonly known as Arctic sweet vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Arctic and alpine regions of northern Europe and North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. Hedysarum hedysaroides subsp. arcticum plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and supports pollinators with its nectar-rich flowers."
