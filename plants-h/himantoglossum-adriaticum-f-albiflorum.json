    "intro": "Himantoglossum adriaticum f. albiflorum, commonly known as the Adriatic helleborine, is a rare and striking orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its large, showy white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and is often found in shaded, moist woodland habitats. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is distinguished by its unique floral structure and specialized pollination mechanisms. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
