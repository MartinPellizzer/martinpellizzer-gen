    "intro": "Heteropterys prancei, commonly known as the Prance's evergreen huito, is a member of the Malvaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at mid to high elevations. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
