    "intro": "Hieracium enantiodon, commonly known as the devil's bit scabious, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its upper leaves are more narrow and reduced. Its flowers are typically blue or purple, with a distinctive yellow center, and it blooms from late spring to early autumn. Hieracium enantiodon thrives in moist meadows and woodland edges, often forming dense colonies in its native habitat."
