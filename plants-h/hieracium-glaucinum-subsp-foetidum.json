    "intro": "Hieracium glaucinum subsp. foetidum, commonly known as stinking hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow disc flowers surrounded by pale green to reddish bracts. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture, and the plant emits a strong, unpleasant odor, which is thought to deter herbivores. It is a relatively short-lived perennial, with a lifespan of about 2 to 5 years."
