    "intro": "Hieracium vindobonense subsp. vindobonense, commonly known as the Vienna hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe. It typically grows in dry meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in the summer months. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitats. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
