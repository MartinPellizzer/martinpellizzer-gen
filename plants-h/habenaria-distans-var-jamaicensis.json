    "intro": "Habenaria distans var. jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican butterfly orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, butterfly-like flowers with a pale greenish-yellow hue and intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
