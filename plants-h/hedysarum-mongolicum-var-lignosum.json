It is characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically pubescent. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, often arranged in racemate inflorescences. It is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in steppe and forest-steppe ecosystems. Hedysarum mongolicum var. lignosum is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
