It belongs to the family Najadaceae and is native to freshwater environments in North America. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically found in clusters near the water's surface. Its reproductive structures include both male and female flowers, which contribute to its dioecious nature. Heterosperma dicranocarpum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
