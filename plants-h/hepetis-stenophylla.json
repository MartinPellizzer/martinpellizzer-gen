    "intro": "Hepetis stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf heath, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually blue or violet in color. It is often found in alpine meadows and is part of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
