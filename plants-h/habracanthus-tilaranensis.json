    "intro": "Habracanthus tilaranensis, commonly known as the Tilaran habracanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Tilaran. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep purple to bright red. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and has adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are ovate and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
