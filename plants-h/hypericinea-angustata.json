It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species in arid environments. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antidepressant effects."
