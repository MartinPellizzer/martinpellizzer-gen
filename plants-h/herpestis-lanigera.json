    "intro": "Herpestis lanigera, commonly known as the hairy false nettle, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant has finely hairy stems and leaves with a serrated margin, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. Its small white flowers bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Despite its appearance, it is not related to true nettles and lacks the stinging hairs found in the Urtica genus."
