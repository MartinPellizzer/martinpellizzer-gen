    "intro": "Hieracium glaucinum subsp. subalatiforme, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that are typically lanceolate to ovate in shape. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a single head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
