    "intro": "Haplopteris dareicarpa, commonly known as the slender shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a unique structure with a short, creeping rhizome and closely spaced, shield-shaped pinnae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are positioned on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
