    "intro": "Hieracium cymosum subsp. origenes, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves and tall, branched stems that bear yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in cymes, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is part of the dandelion family (Asteraceae) and is known for its hardy nature in harsh environments."
