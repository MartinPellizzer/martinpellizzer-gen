    "intro": "Hypochaeris atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils along the shoreline, showcasing its adaptability to coastal environments. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer, followed by pappus-equipped seeds for wind dispersal. Hypochaeris atlantica is often considered a weed but plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small insects."
