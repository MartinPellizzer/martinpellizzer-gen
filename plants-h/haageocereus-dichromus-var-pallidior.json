It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems and is known for its striking white flowers that open at night. The plant has a spiny exterior, with areoles that bear both spines and flowers. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and nocturnal blooming habit."
