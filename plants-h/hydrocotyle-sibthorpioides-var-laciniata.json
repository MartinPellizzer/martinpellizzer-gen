    "intro": "Hydrocotyle sibthorpioides var. laciniata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh mallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with finely divided, lobed leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland conservation efforts."
