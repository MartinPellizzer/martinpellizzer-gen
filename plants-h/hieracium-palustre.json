    "intro": "Hieracium palustre, commonly known as swamp hawkweed, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist or waterlogged soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features upright stems that can reach up to 60 cm in height, covered with fine hairs. Its leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and often have a rough texture. The flowers are yellow and borne in dense, flat-topped clusters, making it a distinctive member of the daisy family."
