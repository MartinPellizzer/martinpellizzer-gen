    "intro": "Hordeum comosum var. humile, commonly known as the dwarf barley, is a species of grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few inches, making it well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. The flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant produces small, hard grains that are not typically used for food but are of interest in botanical studies."
