    "intro": "Haemanthus strigosus, commonly known as the woolly haemanthus, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking, umbel-like inflorescence composed of bright red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely available commercially."
