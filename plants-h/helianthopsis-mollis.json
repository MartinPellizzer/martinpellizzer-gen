    "intro": "Helianthopsis mollis, commonly known as the soft sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and daisy-like appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The showy yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
