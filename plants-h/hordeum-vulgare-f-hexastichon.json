    "intro": "Hordeum vulgare f. hexastichon, commonly known as the six-row barley. This botanical variant is a cultivated form of barley characterized by its six-rowed inflorescence, which distinguishes it from other barley types. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is primarily grown for its grains, which are used in food, animal feed, and brewing. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender stems and small, spike-like flowers. Its seeds are encased in a hull, which is removed during processing to produce barley grains used in various applications."
