    "intro": "Hedyotis schlechtendahliana f. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed inch plant, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, opposite leaves that are usually lanceolate in shape. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, clustered in cymes, and attract various pollinators such as bees and flies. This variant is distinguished by its glabrous (smooth) stems, which set it apart from other forms of the species. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America and thrives in humid, shaded environments."
