    "intro": "Hebe pubescens subsp. rehuarum, commonly known as the Ruahine hebe, is a compact shrub native to New Zealand. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of violet or purple during late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal planting. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
