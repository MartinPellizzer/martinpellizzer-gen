    "intro": "Hovea parvicalyx, commonly known as the small-leaved hovea, is a small evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is often found in coastal and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open to release the seeds, aiding in its propagation. Hovea parvicalyx is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
