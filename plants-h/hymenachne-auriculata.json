It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves with a distinctive auriculate (ear-like) base at the leaf blade junction. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to brownish flowers. Hymenachne auriculata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
