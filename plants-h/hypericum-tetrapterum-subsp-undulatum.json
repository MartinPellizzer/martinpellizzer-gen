    "intro": "Hypericum tetrapterum subsp. undulatum, commonly known as the wavy-stemmed St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often wavy or zigzagging stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Its medicinal properties, similar to other Hypericum species, have made it of interest in traditional herbal medicine."
