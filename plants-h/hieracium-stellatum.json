    "intro": "Hieracium stellatum, commonly known as the star dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm and features basal leaves that are heart-shaped with hairy surfaces. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, consisting of a central disc surrounded by ray florets. Its flowers are followed by distinctive, puffed seed heads that disperse seeds by wind. Hieracium stellatum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
