It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and ornamental gardening."
