    "intro": "Hieracium erythrocarpum subsp. pollichiotropium, commonly known as the red-fruited hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in summer. The subspecies is notable for its distinctive red, fleshy fruits that persist into winter, providing a visual contrast to the rest of the plant. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. The plant is native to southern Europe and has been introduced to other regions, where it can become invasive in certain environments."
