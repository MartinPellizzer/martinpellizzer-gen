    "intro": "Hieracium alpinum subsp. ormeanum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers and hairy, rough leaves. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. It has a low-growing habit with a rosette of basal leaves and is often found at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
