    "intro": "Hieracium jacquinii, commonly known as Jacquin's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering head composed of yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale yellow to brownish ray florets. Native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, it thrives in dry, sunny environments. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse its seeds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
