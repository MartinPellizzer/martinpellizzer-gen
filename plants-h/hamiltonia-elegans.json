    "intro": "Hamiltonia elegans, commonly known as the elegant hamiltonia, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on cliffs or among moss-covered rocks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces pale yellow or greenish-white blossoms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
