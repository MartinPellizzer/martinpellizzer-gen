    "intro": "Haplopteris ensiformis, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Haplopteraceae. It is characterized by its narrow, blade-like fronds that are typically divided into segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Haplopteris ensiformis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
