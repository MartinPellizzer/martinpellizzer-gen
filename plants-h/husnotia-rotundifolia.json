It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are typically arranged in a compact rosette formation. The plant produces delicate, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
