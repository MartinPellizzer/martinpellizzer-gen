    "intro": "Habenaria chapmanii, commonly known as Chapman's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. The plant features a slender, upright stem with a single, showy, white to pale pink flower. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette at the base of the stem. The orchid has a complex root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the acidic, organic-rich soil in which it thrives."
