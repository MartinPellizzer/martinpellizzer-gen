    "intro": "Hedychium poilanei, commonly known as the Poliane ginger lily, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like ginger and turmeric. The plant is characterized by its large, fragrant white or yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a distinctive red or orange spathe. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense clumps in moist, shady environments. Hedychium poilanei is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its potential medicinal properties."
