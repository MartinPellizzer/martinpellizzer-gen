It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine meadows, preferring well-drained soils. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, inconspicuous florets in its capitula. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
