    "intro": "Hordelymus asper, commonly known as the rough hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are rough to the touch, hence the species name \"asper,\" and its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. Hordelymus asper is often found in disturbed habitats and can spread through its seeds dispersed by wind."
