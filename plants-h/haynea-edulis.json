    "intro": "Haynea edulis, commonly known as the edible haynea, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Brazil. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are edible and have been traditionally used by indigenous communities for food and medicinal purposes. Haynea edulis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity."
