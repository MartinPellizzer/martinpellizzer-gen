    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. pseudosemisilvaticum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture. This subspecies is native to parts of Europe and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations due to its nectar-rich flowers."
