It features compact, upright growth with fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its unique foliage and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and ornamental gardening."
