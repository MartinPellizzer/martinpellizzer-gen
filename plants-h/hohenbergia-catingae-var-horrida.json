    "intro": "Hohenbergia catingae var. horrida, commonly known as the rough hohenbergia, is a bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, spiky inflorescence and broad, dark green leaves with a waxy texture. The plant produces vibrant orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a dramatic visual effect. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
