    "intro": "Howellia, commonly known as the common rockcress, is a genus of flowering plants in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure and features small, often white or yellow flowers. The leaves are typically basal, with a pinnate or compound structure, and the plant is often found in rocky or arid environments. Howellia species are generally hardy and drought-tolerant, making them suitable for xeriscaping. They play a role in stabilizing soil in rocky areas and are sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
