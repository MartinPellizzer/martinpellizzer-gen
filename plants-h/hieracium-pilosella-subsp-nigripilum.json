    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. nigripilum, commonly known as the black-hair hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly lance-shaped and covered with dense, blackish-brown hairs, giving it its distinctive appearance. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and it produces small, elongated achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. It is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and medicinal properties in some species."
