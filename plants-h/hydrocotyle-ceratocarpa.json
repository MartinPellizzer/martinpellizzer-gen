    "intro": "Hydrocotyle ceratocarpa, commonly known as the smooth water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has floating leaves that are usually round or heart-shaped with a smooth edge. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and bloom from late spring to early summer. Hydrocotyle ceratocarpa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality through its dense vegetation."
