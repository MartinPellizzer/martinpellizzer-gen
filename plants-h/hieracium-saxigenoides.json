    "intro": "Hieracium saxigenoides, commonly known as the saxifrage hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms low, compact rosettes of hairy, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with a central disc surrounded by petal-like bracts. Hieracium saxigenoides is adapted to harsh conditions, with a deep root system and waxy foliage that helps reduce water loss."
