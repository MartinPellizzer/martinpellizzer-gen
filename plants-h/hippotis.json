    "intro": "Hippotis, commonly known as the narrowleaf false nettle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Scrophulariaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are herbaceous annuals or perennials native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces, and they produce small, tubular flowers that are often pink or purple in color. Hippotis species are often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and meadows. Their flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to their ecological significance."
