    "intro": "Heliophila sabulosa var. glabrescens, commonly known as the sand heliophyte, is a flowering plant native to sandy coastal areas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. This variety is distinguished by its glabrous (smooth) surfaces, giving it a sleek appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in maritime climates."
