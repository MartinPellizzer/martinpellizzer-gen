    "intro": "Hydrocotyle leucocephala var. truncatiloba, commonly known as the broadleaf water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features floating leaves that are rounded and often have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months, adding a delicate appearance to its habitat. Its roots are adapted for anchoring in soft, muddy substrates, and it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems. This variant is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical form of Hydrocotyle leucocephala."
