    "intro": "Heliotropium muticum, commonly known as the sticky heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant has hairy, often sticky leaves and stems, which help in reducing water loss in arid environments. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. Heliotropium muticum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in coastal areas due to its tolerance to salt and drought."
