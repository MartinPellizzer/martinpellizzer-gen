It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. It has hairy leaves and stems, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Hieracium musartutense plays a role in pollination and serves as a food source for certain Arctic insects."
