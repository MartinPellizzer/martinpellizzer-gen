    "intro": "Habenaria sceptrophora, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pale green, leafless stems and small, white or greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its unique appearance and elusive nature make it a subject of fascination among botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is listed as endangered in many regions."
