    "intro": "Hakea rubra, commonly known as the red hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of bright red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds dispersed by animals. Hakea rubra is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy plant in coastal and sandy soils."
