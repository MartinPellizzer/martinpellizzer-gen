    "intro": "Haworthiopsis fasciata, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features a compact, rosette-shaped growth pattern with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with distinct white or yellowish stripes. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers on long, slender stems during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and requiring minimal watering. Due to its striking appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
