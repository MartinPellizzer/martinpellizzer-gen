    "intro": "Hieracium ramosissimum subsp. lactucifolium, commonly known as the milkleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are usually hairy and have a milky sap when damaged. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a distinct central vein, while the stems are upright and branching. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas."
