It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by edible, fleshy berries. Its foliage is highly aromatic, with a scent reminiscent of citrus and mint. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
