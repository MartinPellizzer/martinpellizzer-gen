    "intro": "Hieracium himatiophidum, commonly known as the redstem hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a distinctive red stem. Hieracium himatiophidum is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
