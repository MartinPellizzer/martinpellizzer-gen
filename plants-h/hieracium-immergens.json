    "intro": "Hieracium immergens, commonly known as the submerged hawkweed, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. The plant has dark green, elongated leaves that are often submerged, with small, yellowish flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its roots help stabilize the sediment, contributing to water clarity. It is considered an indicator species for nutrient-rich waters due to its preference for high mineral content."
