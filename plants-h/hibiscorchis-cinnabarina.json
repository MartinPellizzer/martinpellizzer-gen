    "intro": "Hibiscorchis cinnabarina, commonly known as the cinnabar hibiscorchis, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange flowers, which are adorned with intricate patterns resembling cinnabar, a type of vermilion pigment. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are elliptical and covered in a dense, velvety pubescence that helps reduce water loss in its humid, high-altitude habitat. Hibiscorchis cinnabarina is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts due to its rarity and unique aesthetic appeal."
