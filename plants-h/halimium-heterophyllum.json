    "intro": "Halimium heterophyllum, commonly known as the woolly rockrose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that provides insulation against the harsh coastal climate. The plant produces showy, pink or white flowers in late spring, which are clustered in terminal racemes. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for rocky or sandy soils. Halimium heterophyllum is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and hardy nature."
