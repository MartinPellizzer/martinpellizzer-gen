    "intro": "Holcus mollis var. parviflorus, commonly known as narrowleaf quaking grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are clustered along the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
