    "intro": "Hibiscus angulosus, commonly known as the angular hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. The plant features narrow, angular leaves and produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of red, yellow, and orange. Hibiscus angulosus is adapted to withstand drought conditions and has a deep root system for water retention. It is also known for its ability to thrive in full sun and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
