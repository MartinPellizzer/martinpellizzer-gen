    "intro": "Hieracium neocerinthe, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium neocerinthe is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its aggressive growth habit."
