    "intro": "Hydrosme preussii, commonly known as the Preuss's hydrosme, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater ecosystems of Central Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, ribbon-like leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapted to absorb nutrients from the water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, which are pollinated by aquatic insects. It thrives in slow-moving waters with soft, nutrient-rich substrates. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Hydrosme preussii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
