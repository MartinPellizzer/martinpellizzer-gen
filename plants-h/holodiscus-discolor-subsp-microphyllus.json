    "intro": "Holodiscus discolor subsp. microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved holodiscus, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
