    "intro": "Horminum pyrenaicum f. majus, commonly known as the giant pyrenean bellflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the Pyrenees region. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces large, showy blue or violet flowers during the summer months. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is typically found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
