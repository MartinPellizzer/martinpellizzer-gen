    "intro": "Hedysarum purpureopilosum, commonly known as the purple-hair vetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring compound leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and can become woody with age, contributing to its ability to thrive in rocky or arid soils. Hedysarum purpureopilosum is often found in dry, open habitats such as slopes and grasslands."
