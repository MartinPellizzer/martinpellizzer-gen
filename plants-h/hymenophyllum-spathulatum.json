    "intro": "Hymenophyllum spathulatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf filmy fern, is a member of the Hymenophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds. It is a small epiphytic or lithophytic fern typically found in moist, shaded environments such as tropical and subtropical forests. The fronds are usually broad and ovate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an important species in the study of epiphytic plant ecology."
