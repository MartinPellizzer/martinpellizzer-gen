    "intro": "Helianthemum nummularium subsp. tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly sandmat, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, rounded, silver-gray leaves covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for Mediterranean-style landscapes."
