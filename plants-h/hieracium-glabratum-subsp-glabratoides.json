It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in composite flower heads, which are typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf texture and plant structure."
