    "intro": "Hieracium antarcticum, commonly known as Antarctic hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern regions of South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as the Andes, where it thrives in cold, arid conditions. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves and produces yellow flowers in late summer. Its small, hairy leaves help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Hieracium antarcticum is adapted to survive in extreme climates with minimal moisture and intense sunlight."
