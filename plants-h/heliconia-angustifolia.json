    "intro": "Heliconia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf heliconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored inflorescences that resemble a spiral of flowers. The plant has broad, waxy leaves that are typically green and arranged in a rosette pattern. Its flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure. Heliconia angustifolia is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and as part of tropical landscapes."
