It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Hymenostegia brachyura is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and undergrowth."
