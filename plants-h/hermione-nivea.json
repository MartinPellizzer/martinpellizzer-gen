    "intro": "Hermione nivea, commonly known as the snow-white lily, is a delicate flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its pale, almost white petals that resemble snow, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a silvery underside that adds to its aesthetic appeal. Hermione nivea blooms in late spring to early summer, producing fragrant flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
