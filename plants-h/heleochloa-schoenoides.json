    "intro": "Heleochloa schoenoides, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along waterways. Its inflorescence consists of narrow, spike-like clusters of small, greenish flowers. Heleochloa schoenoides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
