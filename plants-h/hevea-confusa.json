    "intro": "Hevea confusa, commonly known as the Malayan rubber tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The plant is notable for its latex-producing capabilities, which have historically been harvested for natural rubber. It thrives in humid, tropical climates with high rainfall and is often found in lowland rainforests. The species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitat."
