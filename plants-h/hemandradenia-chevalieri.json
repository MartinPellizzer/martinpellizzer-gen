    "intro": "Hemandradenia chevalieri, commonly known as the Cape York rock fig, is a flowering plant native to northern Australia. It is a small, shrub-like species with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of Queensland. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
