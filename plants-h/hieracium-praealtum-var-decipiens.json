    "intro": "Hieracium praealtum var. decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with hairy stems and basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape. Its flowers are yellow and bloom from late spring to early autumn, attracting various pollinators. This variant is distinguished by its morphological similarity to other Hieracium species, which can make identification challenging without close examination."
