    "intro": "Hardwickia pinnata, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles. Its fruits are woody pods that contain seeds, and the plant is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its slow growth and susceptibility to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
