    "intro": "Hesperocyparis guadalupensis, commonly known as the Guadalupe fir, is a species of conifer native to the coastal mountains of Baja California, Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, evergreen foliage and conical shape, with needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to a mild, coastal climate with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
