    "intro": "Helianthemum \u00d7 siberi, commonly known as the Siberian rockrose, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wool, which helps to reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Helianthemum \u00d7 siberi is also valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in colder climates."
