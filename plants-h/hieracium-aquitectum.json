It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in moist or wet environments such as marshes, stream banks, and ditches. Its leaves are usually rough and hairy, with a bluish or purplish hue, and the flowers are yellow with a central disk. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
