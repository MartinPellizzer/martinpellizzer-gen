    "intro": "Hieracium bruyeranum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering heads that produce yellow disc flowers surrounded by pale yellow to white ray florets. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges. It has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. Due to its adaptability, it is considered a common weed in various parts of Europe and North America."
