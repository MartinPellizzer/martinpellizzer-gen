    "intro": "Hanburia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Haemodoraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to southern Africa. These plants are characterized by their striking, often red or orange-colored flowers that resemble ghostly faces, hence their common name. Hanburia species are typically found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in arid or semi-arid environments. They are herbaceous perennials, often growing close to the ground with fibrous roots adapted to drought conditions."
