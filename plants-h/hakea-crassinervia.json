    "intro": "Hakea crassinervia, commonly known as the broad-veined hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its woody structure and specialized leaf anatomy make it well-suited to arid and semi-arid environments. Hakea crassinervia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to local wildlife."
