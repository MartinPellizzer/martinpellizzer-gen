It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically green when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
