    "intro": "Hierophyllus, commonly known as the sacred grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, often aromatic leaves. The flowers are typically small and clustered in umbels, a common feature among members of the carrot family. Hierophyllus species are often found in moist, temperate regions and are valued for their medicinal properties. Due to their delicate nature, they require careful cultivation and are sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
