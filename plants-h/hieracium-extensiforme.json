    "intro": "Hieracium extensiforme, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in a single terminal head. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grasslands. It has hairy stems and is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native vegetation."
