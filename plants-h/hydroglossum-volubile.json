    "intro": "Hydroglossum volubile, commonly known as the trailing water bellflower, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to thrive in waterlogged conditions. Hydroglossum volubile is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems."
