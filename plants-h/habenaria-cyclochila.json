    "intro": "Habenaria cyclochila, commonly known as the orchid with the spiral-shaped lip, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, particularly the intricate, spiral-shaped lip that distinguishes it from other orchid species. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
