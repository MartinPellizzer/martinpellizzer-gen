    "intro": "Hieracium maranzae subsp. malacofloccosum, commonly known as the Malacofloccous Hawkweed, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy leaves, which are adaptations to its alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy areas at high elevations, where it faces harsh environmental conditions. Its subspecies status highlights its distinct morphological and genetic traits compared to other members of the Hieracium genus. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
