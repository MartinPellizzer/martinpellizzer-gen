It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is native to regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its fronds are narrow, undulating, and covered with tiny, scale-like structures called rhizoids. This variety is notable for its intricate morphology and is often found in high-altitude cloud forests."
