    "intro": "Haplopappus doellianus, commonly known as the desert pappus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its small, yellow flowers are followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds that aid in its propagation. Haplopappus doellianus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
