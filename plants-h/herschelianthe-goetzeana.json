It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
