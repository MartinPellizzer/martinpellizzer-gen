    "intro": "Hieracium sparsiflorum subsp. kotschyanum, commonly known as the Kotschyan's hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils. It has finely divided, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a single head. This subspecies is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations."
