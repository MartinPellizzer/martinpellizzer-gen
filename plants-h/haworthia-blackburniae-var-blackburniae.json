It is characterized by its compact rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically pale green to bluish-gray in color. The leaves are adorned with distinct white or pale markings, which give the plant its striking appearance. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the warmer months. This species is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
