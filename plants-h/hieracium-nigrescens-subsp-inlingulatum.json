It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. It has a creeping rootstock and produces numerous flowering stems that can reach up to 30 cm in height.
