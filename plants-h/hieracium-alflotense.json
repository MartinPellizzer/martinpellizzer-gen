    "intro": "Hieracium alflotense, commonly known as the Alflot's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flower heads that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant is native to Europe and is often found in meadows, pastures, and other open, sunny habitats. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread vegetatively. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
