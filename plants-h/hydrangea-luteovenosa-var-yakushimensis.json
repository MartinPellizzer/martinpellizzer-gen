    "intro": "Hydrangea luteovenosa var. yakushimensis, commonly known as the Yakushimanensis hydrangea, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often serrated leaves that display a striking yellow-green to reddish hue. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its limited natural range and specific growing conditions, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native habitat."
