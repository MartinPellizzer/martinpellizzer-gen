    "intro": "Hypericum uliginosum var. nigropunctatum, commonly known as black dot St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves with small, black dots on the underside, which give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along stream banks. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a valuable species for wetland restoration projects."
