    "intro": "Hieracium farinifloccum, commonly known as the floury flocculent hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant is noted for its hairy, lobed leaves and yellow to orange flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
