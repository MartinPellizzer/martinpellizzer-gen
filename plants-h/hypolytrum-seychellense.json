    "intro": "Hypolytrum seychellense, commonly known as the Seychelles grass, is a flowering plant native to the Seychelles archipelago. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in coastal and sandy habitats, often found in dunes or on rocky shores. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
