It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils.

The plant is known for its ability to spread via acaulescent stems and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
