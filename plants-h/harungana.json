    "intro": "Harungana, commonly known as the African blackwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and thick, waxy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by small, spherical fruits that contain a single seed. Harungana is also valued for its ability to thrive in arid conditions, making it an important species in ecological restoration. Its botanical features make it both ecologically and economically significant in its native regions."
