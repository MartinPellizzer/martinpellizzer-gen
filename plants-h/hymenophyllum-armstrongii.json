    "intro": "Hymenophyllum armstrongii, commonly known as the Armstrong's haircap, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, hair-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This epiphytic plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are covered with a dense layer of rhizomes and have a unique structure that aids in water retention. The spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
