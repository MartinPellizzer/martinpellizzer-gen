    "intro": "Habenaria ernstii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, white, and often translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows on the bark of trees in wet, shaded environments, forming a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often clustered at the base of the plant. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
