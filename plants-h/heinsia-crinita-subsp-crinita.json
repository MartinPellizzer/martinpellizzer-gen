    "intro": "Heinsia crinita subsp. crinita, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. Heinsia crinita subsp. crinita is an important component of coastal scrub ecosystems and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
