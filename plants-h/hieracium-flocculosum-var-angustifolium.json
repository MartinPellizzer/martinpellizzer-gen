It features a basal rosette of leaves that are narrow and often hairy, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
