    "intro": "Haplolobus maluensis, commonly known as the Maluense cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family native to the Pacific Islands. This plant is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves that can reach several meters in length. It produces cones rather than flowers, with the male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. The plant is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
