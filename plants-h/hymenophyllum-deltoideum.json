    "intro": "Hymenophyllum deltoideum, commonly known as the delta fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, deltoid-shaped fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spores on the underside of its leaves, which are covered in a thin, membranous layer called the hymenium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. This species is noted for its unique morphology and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
