The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers arranged in dense, flat-topped clusters, which bloom in late summer to early fall. Its foliage is aromatic and can be used in herbal remedies, while its structure makes it an attractive addition to native plant gardens. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and open woodlands."
