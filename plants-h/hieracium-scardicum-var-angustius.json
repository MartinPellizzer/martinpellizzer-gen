It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils and grasslands. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
