It typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in dense clusters. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. This subspecies is often found in mountainous areas where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
