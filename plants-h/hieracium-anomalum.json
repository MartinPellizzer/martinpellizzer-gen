    "intro": "Hieracium anomalum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. Its yellow flowers, which bloom in summer, are surrounded by a cluster of small, petal-less ray florets. Hieracium anomalum is often found in open habitats and can sometimes become invasive in certain regions."
