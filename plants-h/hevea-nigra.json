    "intro": "Hevea nigra, commonly known as the black rubber tree, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall. The plant is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Its most notable botanical feature is the latex it secretes, which has been historically used for rubber production. The tree thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires a warm climate for optimal growth."
