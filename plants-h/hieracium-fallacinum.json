    "intro": "Hieracium fallacinum, commonly known as the autumn hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn. Hieracium fallacinum is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain habitats."
