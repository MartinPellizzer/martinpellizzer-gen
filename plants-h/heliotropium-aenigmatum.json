    "intro": "Heliotropium aenigmatum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, pale purple to white flowers that bloom in clusters, often giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and saline soils, showing a high degree of salt tolerance. Its leaves are opposite and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is also notable for its unique pollination mechanism, attracting specific insect pollinators."
