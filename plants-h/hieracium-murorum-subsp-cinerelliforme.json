    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. cinerelliforme, commonly known as the cinerella hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and southern Europe. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and waste areas. The plant has basal rosettes of grey-green, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in summer. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a single inflorescence. This subspecies is often confused with other hawkweeds due to its similar appearance but can be distinguished by its specific leaf and flower morphology."
