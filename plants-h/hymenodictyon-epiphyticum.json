    "intro": "Hymenodictyon epiphyticum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is an epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, elongated, white or pale green flowers that resemble ghostly figures. The plant relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding environment rather than soil. It thrives in humid, shaded conditions and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
