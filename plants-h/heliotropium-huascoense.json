    "intro": "Heliotropium huascoense, commonly known as the Huasco heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of northern Chile. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its small, pinkish to purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to the arid and saline conditions of its native habitat. It has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss, and its stems are often prostrate or ascending. Heliotropium huascoense is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
