It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, sickle-shaped petals and sepals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers are often pale green or white, with a distinctive, recurved lip that aids in pollination. The orchid's rhizomes are fibrous, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds."
