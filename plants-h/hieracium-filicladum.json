    "intro": "Hieracium filicladum, commonly known as the fern-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it its common name, and it produces yellow flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, grassy areas and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
