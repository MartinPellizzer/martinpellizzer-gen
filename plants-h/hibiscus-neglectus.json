    "intro": "Hibiscus neglectus, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces capsules that contain numerous seeds. Hibiscus neglectus is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots and a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It is often found in rocky soils and is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
