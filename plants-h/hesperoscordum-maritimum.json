It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic, compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
