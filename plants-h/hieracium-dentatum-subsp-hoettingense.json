It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow flowering heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes. It has finely toothed leaves and produces small, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many areas."
