It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant features a slender, leafy stem with a single or few flowers that are usually pale green or white. Its flowers have three sepals and three petals, with the lateral petals often resembling a lip. The orchid's roots are fibrous, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption."
