    "intro": "Hieracium sabaudum subsp. rigidiforme, commonly known as the rigid-hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which are often glandular and contribute to its distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically lanceolate and covered with dense, stiff hairs, giving the plant a rough texture. It produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are borne on elongated peduncles. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and roadsides."
