    "intro": "Hieracium austrotiroliense, commonly known as the Austrian hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Central Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. It has bright yellow flowers and hairy stems, which help it to retain moisture in drier conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
