    "intro": "Hyperbaena cubensis var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved Cuban hyperbaena, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are often borne in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species in its native habitat."
