    "intro": "Hakea striata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is an evergreen shrub native to southwestern Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces striking yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Hakea striata is well adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
