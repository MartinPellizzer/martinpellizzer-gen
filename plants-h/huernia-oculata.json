    "intro": "Huernia oculata, commonly known as the horned African violet, is a succulent native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are usually green with distinct, raised bumps or tubercles. Huernia oculata is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal watering to thrive."
