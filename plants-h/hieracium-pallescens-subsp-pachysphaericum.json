    "intro": "Hieracium pallescens subsp. pachysphaericum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its subsp. pachysphaericum variant is distinguished by its more robust stems and enlarged, spherical flower heads. This species is often found in open habitats and is relatively easy to cultivate in gardens with well-drained soil."
