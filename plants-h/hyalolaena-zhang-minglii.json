    "intro": "Hyalolaena zhang-minglii, commonly known as the Zhang-Minglii's ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typical of many ferns. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
