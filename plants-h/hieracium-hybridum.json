It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers range from yellow to red, depending on the variety. Hieracium hybridum is known for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes and seeds, making it both a common weed and a valued ornamental plant."
