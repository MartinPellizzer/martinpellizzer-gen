    "intro": "Heteropogon androphilus, commonly known as the purple false brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and disturbed sites. Heteropogon androphilus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
