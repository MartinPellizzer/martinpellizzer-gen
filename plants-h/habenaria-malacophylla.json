    "intro": "Habenaria malacophylla, commonly known as the Malacophyll Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose raceme, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
