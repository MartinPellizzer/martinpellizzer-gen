    "intro": "Helichrysum lindleyi, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, yellow-orange flowers that resemble small suns. The plant produces small, papery bracts that give it a fluffy appearance, often mistaken for actual flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its name reflects both its enduring appearance and its historical use in floral arrangements."
