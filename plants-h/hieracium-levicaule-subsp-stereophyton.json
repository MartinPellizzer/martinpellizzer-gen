    "intro": "Hieracium levicaule subsp. stereophyton, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves that are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, with a central stem that bears small, yellowish flowers. Its inflorescence consists of a single, compact head of disc flowers surrounded by phyllaries. The subspecies is distinguished by its slender stem and reduced leaf structure compared to other members of the Hieracium genus."
