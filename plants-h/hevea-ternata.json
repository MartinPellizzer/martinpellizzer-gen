    "intro": "Hevea ternata, commonly known as the rubber vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit and produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its latex sap, while not as commercially valuable as that of Hevea brasiliensis, has been used in traditional applications. Hevea ternata plays a role in local ecosystems and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
