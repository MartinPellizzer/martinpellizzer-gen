    "intro": "Helianthemum montanum var. alpestre, commonly known as the alpine sunflower, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments with cool temperatures and strong winds. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is often found in meadows and slopes at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters."
