It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the summer months, and the plant is notable for its reddish-brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium erythrospermum is also known for its aggressive growth habit, making it a potential invasive species in some regions."
