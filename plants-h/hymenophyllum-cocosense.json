    "intro": "Hymenophyllum cocosense, commonly known as the coconut fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Pacific. It has delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important species in tropical rainforest ecosystems."
