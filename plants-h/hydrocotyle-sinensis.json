    "intro": "Hydrocotyle sinensis, commonly known as the Asiatic shield-leaf, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It features a rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often submerged or floating on water surfaces. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers with five petals, typically blooming in summer. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats in wetland environments. Hydrocotyle sinensis is often found in marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams, where it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems."
