    "intro": "Hypericum patulum subsp. variabile, commonly known as variable St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically features prostrate or ascending stems with opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its variable morphology, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish from other subspecies of Hypericum patulum."
