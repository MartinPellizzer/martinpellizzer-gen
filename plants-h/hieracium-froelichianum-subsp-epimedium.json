    "intro": "Hieracium froelichianum subsp. epimedium, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many regions."
