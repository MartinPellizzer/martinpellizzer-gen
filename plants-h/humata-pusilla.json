    "intro": "Humata pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf humata, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are usually white or pale blue, arranged in loose clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy or marshy areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Humata pusilla is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
