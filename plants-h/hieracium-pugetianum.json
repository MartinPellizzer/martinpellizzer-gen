    "intro": "Hieracium pugetianum, commonly known as Puget Island Hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow daisy-like flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces achenes (small, dry fruits) that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
