    "intro": "Hippocratea urceolus subsp. xerophila, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, succulent leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in drought conditions, making it highly adapted to xeric environments. Its flowers are typically pollinated by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their shape and nectar content. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging climates."
