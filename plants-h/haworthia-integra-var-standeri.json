    "intro": "Haworthia integra var. standeri, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically green with distinctive white or pale blue markings resembling a zebra's stripes. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It produces small, tubular flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. Due to its low maintenance and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
