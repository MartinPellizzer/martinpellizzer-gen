    "intro": "Hieracium laevigatum subsp. grandescens, commonly known as the large-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that are typically arranged in a single inflorescence at the end of each stem. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
