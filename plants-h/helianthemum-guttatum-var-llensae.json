    "intro": "Helianthemum guttatum var. llensae, commonly known as the Alaskan sandverbena, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to coastal regions of Alaska. It features small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, coastal habitat. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand strong winds and salt spray. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
