    "intro": "Hypericum hartwegii var. patens, commonly known as the creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Its stems are prostrate, allowing it to spread along the ground, and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The plant's medicinal properties, similar to other Hypericum species, have been historically noted for their potential antiseptic and anti-inflammatory effects."
