    "intro": "Hieracium barkhausiforme, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and woodland edges. It has a taproot system and produces achenes as its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
