    "intro": "Hedera humi-repens, commonly known as the creeping ivy, is a species of climbing plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for ground cover. Hedera humi-repens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to suppress weeds in garden settings."
