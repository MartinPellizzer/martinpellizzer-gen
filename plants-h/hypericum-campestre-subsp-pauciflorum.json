    "intro": "Hypericum campestre subsp. pauciflorum, commonly known as the lesser St. John's wort, is a low-growing shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and woodland edges. Due to its compact growth and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
