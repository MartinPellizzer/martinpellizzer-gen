It is a low-growing shrub with small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for coastal and rocky habitats. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens with similar environmental conditions."
