    "intro": "Herpestis repens var. multistriata, commonly known as the striped morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves with a distinct veining pattern. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a contrasting throat. Native to the southeastern United States, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
