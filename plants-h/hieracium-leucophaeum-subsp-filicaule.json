    "intro": "Hieracium leucophaeum subsp. filicaule, commonly known as the white-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It prefers moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
