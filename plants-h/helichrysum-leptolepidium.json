    "intro": "Helichrysum leptolepidium, commonly known as the golden everlasting or silverleaf everlasting, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features wiry, branching stems covered in small, silver-gray leaves that are densely packed and felt-like in texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that are often mistaken for daisies, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. Its foliage is aromatic and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
