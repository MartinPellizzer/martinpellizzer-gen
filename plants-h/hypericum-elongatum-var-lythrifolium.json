    "intro": "Hypericum elongatum var. lythrifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are narrow and elliptic, often with a slightly waxy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable plant for rock gardens or borders. This variety is less commonly cultivated than other St. John's wort species but is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
