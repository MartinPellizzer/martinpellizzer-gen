    "intro": "Hedysarum fistulosum, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in forage for livestock. Its root system is fibrous and can help stabilize soil in arid environments. Hedysarum fistulosum is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in degraded areas."
