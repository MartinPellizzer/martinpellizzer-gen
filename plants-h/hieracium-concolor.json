    "intro": "Hieracium concolor, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are rough and hairy, with a heart-shaped base, and its flowers are yellow with a distinctive central disk. Hieracium concolor is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it an aggressive weed in some regions."
