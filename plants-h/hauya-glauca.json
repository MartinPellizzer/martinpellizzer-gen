    "intro": "Hauya glauca, commonly known as the blue hauya, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in regions of Peru and Bolivia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, thriving in temperate and alpine regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery-blue waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Hauya glauca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
