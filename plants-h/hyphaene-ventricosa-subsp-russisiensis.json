    "intro": "Hyphaene ventricosa subsp. russisiensis, commonly known as the Socotra date palm, is a unique plant species native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-shaped crown and thick, fibrous trunk. The plant produces large, clustered inflorescences that develop into edible dates. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain water in its arid environment. This subspecies is also notable for its role in traditional agriculture and cultural practices on Socotra."
