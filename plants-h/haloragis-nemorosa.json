    "intro": "Haloragis nemorosa, commonly known as the water starwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and streamside habitats in eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with slender, branching stems that are often submerged or partially emergent. The plant features small, opposite, ovate leaves with a waxy coating, which help reduce water loss in its aquatic or semi-aquatic environment. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in dense spikes, and are usually greenish-white in color, blooming from June to September. Haloragis nemorosa plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
