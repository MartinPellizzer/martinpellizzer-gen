    "intro": "Hermione ambigena, commonly known as the moonshade orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking bioluminescent petals that glow faintly under moonlight, a unique adaptation for nocturnal pollination. The plant produces small, fragrant blossoms in shades of violet and silver, which emit a subtle, sweet scent. Its roots are known to absorb minerals from the soil, contributing to its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Due to its limited habitat and ecological significance, it is considered a protected species in conservation efforts."
