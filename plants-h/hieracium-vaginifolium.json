    "intro": "Hieracium vaginifolium, commonly known as the hooded hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and open, sunny environments. Its leaves are usually basal, with a distinctive hood-like structure covering the base of the stem. The flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, contributing to the plant's role in pollinator support in its native ecosystems."
