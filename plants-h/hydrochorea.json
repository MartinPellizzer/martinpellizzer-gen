    "intro": "Hydrochorea, commonly known as water lily, is a genus of aquatic flowering plants that thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. The leaves are typically broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Their roots anchor them in the mud at the bottom of ponds or lakes. Hydrochorea plays an important ecological role by providing habitat for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration."
