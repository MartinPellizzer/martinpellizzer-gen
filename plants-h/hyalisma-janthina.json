It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, greenish-white flowers bloom in late spring and are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Hyalisma janthina is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
