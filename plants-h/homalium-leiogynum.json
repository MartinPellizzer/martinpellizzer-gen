    "intro": "Homalium leiogynum, commonly known as the smooth-leaved holly. It is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia, characterized by its glossy, leathery leaves that are typically smooth and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in warm climates."
