It features a rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves with distinctive white veins, which help it store water and reflect sunlight. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers on slender stems during the growing season. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or container cultivation. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
