    "intro": "Heteranthera pumila, commonly known as the small-flowered heteranthera, is a small aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer. Its reproductive structures include both stamens and pistils, with some flowers having two stamens and others having one. Heteranthera pumila is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
