    "intro": "Hymenoxys scaposa var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy hymenoxys, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features narrow, hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The species is noted for its delicate appearance and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and slopes."
