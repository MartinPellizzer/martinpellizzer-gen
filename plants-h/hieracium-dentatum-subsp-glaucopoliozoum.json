It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. The plant features basal rosettes of pale green, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in dense, clustered inflorescences. It has a taproot system and is known for its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is often found in temperate regions and is relatively easy to cultivate in gardens with well-drained soil."
