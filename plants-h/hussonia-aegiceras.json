    "intro": "Hussonia aegiceras, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and silver-green foliage, which help it thrive in saline and sandy environments. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit, making it well-suited for coastal dunes and rocky shores. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which provide protection against salt spray and desiccation. Hussonia aegiceras plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
