It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
