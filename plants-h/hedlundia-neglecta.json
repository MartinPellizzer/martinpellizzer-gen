    "intro": "Hedlundia neglecta, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, showy yellow flowers. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its succulent leaves and deep root system. It is often found in rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. The flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
