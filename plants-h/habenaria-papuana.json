    "intro": "Habenaria papuana, commonly known as the Papuan orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Papua, Indonesia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
