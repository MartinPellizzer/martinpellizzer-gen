    "intro": "Hariota salicornoides var. strictior, commonly known as the narrowleaf glassworts, is a halophytic plant that thrives in saline and coastal environments. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, forming a low, mat-like structure that helps stabilize sandy or muddy soils. Its flowers are small and greenish, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. This variety is closely related to other members of the Amaranthaceae family and is often found in estuarine and tidal zones."
