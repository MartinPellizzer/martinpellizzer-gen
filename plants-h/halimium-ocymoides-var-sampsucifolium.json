It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has slender, branched stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, which help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often have a reddish or purplish hue, especially under stress. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
