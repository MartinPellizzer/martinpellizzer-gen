    "intro": "Hakea gillivrayi, commonly known as the Geraldton Wax, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters, featuring rigid, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of wax. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Hakea gillivrayi is adapted to arid conditions, with its deep root system allowing it to thrive in sandy soils. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
