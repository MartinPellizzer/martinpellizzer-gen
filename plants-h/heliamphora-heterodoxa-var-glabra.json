    "intro": "Heliamphora heterodoxa var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth pitcher plant, is a unique carnivorous plant native to the tepuis of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, trumpet-shaped pitchers that secrete a sticky liquid to trap insects. The plant's leaves form the pitchers, which are modified to create a pit that prevents trapped prey from escaping. The smooth, glabrous surface of the pitchers distinguishes this variety from others in the species. It thrives in high-altitude, nutrient-poor environments, relying on insect prey for essential nutrients."
