    "intro": "Holcoglossum tangii, commonly known as the Tang's holcoglossum, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to southern China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated flowers with a distinctive lip structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments on cliffs or rocky slopes. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
