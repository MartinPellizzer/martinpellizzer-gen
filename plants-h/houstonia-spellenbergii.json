    "intro": "Houstonia spellenbergii, commonly known as the Showy Blue-eyed Grass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, though it is often mistaken for a flowering plant due to its showy blooms. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in moist, open habitats like woodlands and wetlands. Houstonia spellenbergii is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and its ability to thrive in shaded to partially sunny conditions."
