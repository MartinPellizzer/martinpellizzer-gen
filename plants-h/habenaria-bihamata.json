    "intro": "Habenaria bihamata, commonly known as the two-hamata orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with a distinctive two-toned lip, often in shades of pink and white. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
