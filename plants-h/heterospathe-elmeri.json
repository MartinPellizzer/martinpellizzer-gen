    "intro": "Heterospathe elmeri, commonly known as the Elmer's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, featuring slender, pale green leaves and a single, fragrant flower that blooms in late summer. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically within the understory of forests. Its flowers are often pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Heterospathe elmeri is considered a critically endangered species."
