    "intro": "Hydrangea integrifolia, commonly known as the Pacific Coast hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that can range from white to pink or blue, depending on soil pH. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and have a smooth edge, which distinguishes it from other hydrangea species. Hydrangea integrifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal forests and shaded areas."
