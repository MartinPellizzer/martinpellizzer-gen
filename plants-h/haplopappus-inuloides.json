    "intro": "Haplopappus inuloides, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows low to the ground, with grayish-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Haplopappus inuloides is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
