    "intro": "Harpagocarpus snowdenii, commonly known as the Snowden's harpagocarp, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its unique pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets, and the plant grows as an herbaceous annual. The seeds are enclosed within a hard, spiny capsule that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals or clothing."
