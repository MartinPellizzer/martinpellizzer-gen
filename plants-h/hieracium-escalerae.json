    "intro": "Hieracium escalerae, commonly known as the Escalera hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to the Iberian Peninsula and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in sunny, dry habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range."
