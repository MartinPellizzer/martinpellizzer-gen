    "intro": "Hieracium jordanianum, commonly known as Jordanian hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Middle East, particularly Jordan. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically has hairy stems and leaves with a serrated edge, and its flowers are yellow with a central disk. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native region."
