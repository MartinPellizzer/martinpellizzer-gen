It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its resilience in various environments. Hieracium pertinacifolium is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
