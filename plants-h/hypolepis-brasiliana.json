    "intro": "Hypolepis brasiliana, commonly known as the Brazil shield fern, is a tropical fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique adaptation that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
