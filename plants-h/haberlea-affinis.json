    "intro": "Haberlea affinis, commonly known as the rock rose or rock orchid, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, known for its succulent leaves and adaptive features for arid environments. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink, white, and yellow, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Haberlea affinis is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
