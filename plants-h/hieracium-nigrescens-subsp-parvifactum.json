    "intro": "Hieracium nigrescens subsp. parvifactum, commonly known as the small-flowered hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves and yellow ray florets surrounded by a dense cluster of tubular disc florets. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, preferring cool, temperate climates. It produces a single flowering stem that bears a compact inflorescence, and its flowers are typically visited by various pollinators such as bees and flies. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller flower size and more compact growth habit compared to other members of the species."
