    "intro": "Heliconia nigripraefixa, commonly known as the Black-veined Heliconia, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its large, pendulous inflorescences composed of brightly colored bracts that enclose the actual flowers. The plant's leaves are broad and deeply lobed, often with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in humid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Heliconia nigripraefixa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as part of tropical landscapes."
