    "intro": "Helianthemum incanum, commonly known as the woolly rockrose, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant is adapted to rocky and coastal habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
