    "intro": "Heliophila heterophylla, commonly known as the variable waterplantain, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that vary in shape depending on the habitat, a feature that gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Heliophila heterophylla is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
