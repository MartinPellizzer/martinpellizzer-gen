    "intro": "Haplopappus thiniicola, commonly known as the smooth pappus grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fluffy seed heads. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its seeds are surrounded by a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Haplopappus thiniicola is adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats."
