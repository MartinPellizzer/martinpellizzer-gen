    "intro": "Hieracium austriacum, commonly known as the Austrian hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Native to Central Europe, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and rocky soils. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
