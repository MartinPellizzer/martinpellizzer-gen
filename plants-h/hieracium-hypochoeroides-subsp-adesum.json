    "intro": "Hieracium hypochoeroides subsp. adesum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
