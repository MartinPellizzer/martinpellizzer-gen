    "intro": "Heliotropium plumosum, commonly known as the silky heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and clusters of small, pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, while the stems are often branching and covered in fine, silky hairs. Heliotropium plumosum is adapted to well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a common sight in disturbed habitats."
