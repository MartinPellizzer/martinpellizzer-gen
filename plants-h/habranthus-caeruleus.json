    "intro": "Habranthus caeruleus, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its foliage consists of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The flowers bloom in late summer and early fall, producing a dense, mist-like appearance that gives the plant its common name."
