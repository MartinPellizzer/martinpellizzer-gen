    "intro": "Haworthia arachnoidea var. scabrispina, commonly known as the scabrous spine Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and prominent, spiky tubercles. The leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures that give it a unique, almost spider-like appearance. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers on slender stems during the warmer months. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
