    "intro": "Hymenoxys lapidicola, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to low moisture conditions. Hymenoxys lapidicola is often found in crevices and on slopes, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
