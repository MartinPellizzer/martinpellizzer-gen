    "intro": "Hippophae neurocarpa subsp. neurocarpa, commonly known as the sandthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellow-orange berries that are rich in vitamin C and essential fatty acids. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves with a rough texture and is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions. It produces showy yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by the development of its distinctive fruits. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sandy soils."
