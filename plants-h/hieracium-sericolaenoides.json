    "intro": "Hieracium sericolaenoides, commonly known as the silverleaf hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a hairy stem and basal leaves that are often covered in fine, silver-colored hairs, giving it its common name. Its flowers are typically yellow and arranged in a flat, disc-like structure, with ray florets surrounding a central cluster of tubular flowers. Hieracium sericolaenoides is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
