It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety and environmental conditions. The plant has silvery-gray foliage with glandular hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
