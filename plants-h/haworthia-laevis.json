    "intro": "Haworthia laevis, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features compact rosettes of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically pale green with white or yellowish markings. The leaves are covered in a fine, powdery coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers on tall, branched stems during the growing season. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal watering and well-draining soil."
