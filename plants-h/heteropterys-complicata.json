    "intro": "Heteropterys complicata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are deeply lobed and often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that are typically followed by elliptical, winged fruits. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural areas, particularly in the tropics. The species is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
