    "intro": "Hechtia purhepecha, commonly known as the Purhepecha hechtia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to the highlands of central Mexico, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, attracting various pollinators. Its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves is adapted to collect and store water, a feature common in many bromeliads. Hechtia purhepecha is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
