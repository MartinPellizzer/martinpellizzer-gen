    "intro": "Holostigma cheiranthifolium, commonly known as the rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. Its leaves are basal, pinnately divided, and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The flowers are bright yellow and appear in early spring, followed by the production of small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds."
