    "intro": "Habenaria itatiayae, commonly known as the Itatiaya orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to South America, particularly Brazil. This terrestrial orchid typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. It features slender, upright stems with a single or few leaves, and its flowers are usually small, fragrant, and arranged in a spike. The plant's botanical characteristics include a pseudobulb structure and specialized roots adapted for nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
