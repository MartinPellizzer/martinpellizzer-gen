    "intro": "Helianthemum salicifolium var. macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-fruited rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe. It features silvery-green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in the summer, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in Mediterranean climates."
