    "intro": "Helichrysum lupulinum, commonly known as the yellow everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that remain intact even when dried. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread across arid and semi-arid regions. Its foliage is covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry climates. Helichrysum lupulinum is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting, vibrant appearance."
