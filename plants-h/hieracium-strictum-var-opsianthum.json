    "intro": "Hieracium strictum var. opsianthum, commonly known as the narrowleaf hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, exhibiting a rosette of basal leaves with a hairy texture. Its yellow flowers appear in late spring to early summer, and it produces achene seeds that are dispersed by wind. The species is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
