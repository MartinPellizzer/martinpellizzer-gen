    "intro": "Hura crepitans var. genuina, commonly known as the Hawaiian hura or Hawaiian hura tree, is a species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny fruits. Its seeds are enclosed in hard, woody capsules that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds through the wind. The plant is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of Hawaii and plays a role in local ecosystems."
