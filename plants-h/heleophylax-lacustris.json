    "intro": "Heleophylax lacustris, commonly known as the lake marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific wetland habitats. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and is often found in association with other aquatic vegetation. Its reproductive strategy involves pollination by specific insect species, which is crucial for its survival. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Heleophylax lacustris is considered endangered in many regions."
