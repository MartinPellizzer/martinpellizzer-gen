    "intro": "Heliotropium riparium, commonly known as water heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is typically found growing near water bodies such as rivers, marshes, and wetlands, which reflects its preference for moist or aquatic environments. The plant has hairy, erect stems and produces small, clustered flowers that are often pink or purple in color. Its leaves are usually alternate and have a distinctive heart-shaped appearance. Heliotropium riparium is known for its ability to thrive in wet conditions, making it an important component of riparian ecosystems."
