    "intro": "Hieracium neohybridum, commonly known as the hybrid hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically produces yellow or orange flowers, which are surrounded by a series of small, petal-like structures called phyllaries. Hieracium neohybridum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can form dense colonies due to its aggressive growth habits. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
