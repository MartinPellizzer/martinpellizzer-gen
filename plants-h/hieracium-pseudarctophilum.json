    "intro": "Hieracium pseudarctophilum, commonly known as the Arctic groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and typically grows in rocky or barren soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It is adapted to cold climates and has a low-growing habit to withstand harsh winter conditions. Hieracium pseudarctophilum plays a role in its ecosystem by providing food for certain insects and contributing to soil stability in its native habitat."
