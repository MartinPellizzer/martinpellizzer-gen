    "intro": "Helichrysum ferganicum, commonly known as the golden marguerite, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features wiry, branched stems and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that resemble miniature sunflowers. The plant produces small, yellow, papery bracts that persist after the flowers have faded, giving it a striking appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its aromatic leaves and long-lasting blooms make it both ornamental and potentially useful in traditional herbal medicine."
