    "intro": "Hedeoma palmeri var. santiagoana, commonly known as Santiago's hedeoma, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and compact, sparsely branched stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a dense cluster, typical of the genus Hedeoma. It is adapted to hot, dry environments and has a shallow root system that allows it to survive in poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
