    "intro": "Habenaria citrata, commonly known as the lemon orchid, is a terrestrial orchid belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, including regions of China, India, and Indonesia. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with a distinctive lemon-like scent, which attracts pollinators such as bees and wasps. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The orchid's rhizome system allows it to thrive in loose, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for cultivation in botanical gardens."
