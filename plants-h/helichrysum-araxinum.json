It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that resemble small suns. The plant produces small, papery bracts that give it a distinctive appearance, often used in dried floral arrangements. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The leaves are usually linear and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant traits."
