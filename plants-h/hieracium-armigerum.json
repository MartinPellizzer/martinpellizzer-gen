    "intro": "Hieracium armigerum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and can form dense colonies. Its leaves are rough and hairy, with a distinctive yellowish-green color, and its flowers are usually yellow or orange. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
