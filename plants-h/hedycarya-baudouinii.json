It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dark, dense wood and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
