    "intro": "Hedysarum parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flower milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces clusters of pea-like flowers that are usually pink to purple in color. Its root system is fibrous and often forms dense colonies, making it a characteristic component of alpine and steppe ecosystems. Hedysarum parviflorum is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
