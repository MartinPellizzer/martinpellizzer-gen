    "intro": "Helonias umbellata, commonly known as the swamp pink, is a herbaceous perennial native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in marshy or swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are arranged in an umbel, giving it its scientific name. Helonias umbellata plays an important role in wetland ecosystems and is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
