    "intro": "Helicta, commonly known as the common milkweed, is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is native to North America. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of pink to reddish-orange flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which deter herbivores. Helicta typically grows in moist soils along roadsides, fields, and wetlands. It plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing food for their larvae."
