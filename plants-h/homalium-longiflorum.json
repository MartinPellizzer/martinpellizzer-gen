    "intro": "Homalium longiflorum, commonly known as the long-flowered huito, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often obscured by bracts. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and it plays a role in local ecosystems as a food source for various animals. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some areas."
