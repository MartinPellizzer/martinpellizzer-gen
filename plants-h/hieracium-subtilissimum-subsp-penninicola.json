    "intro": "Hieracium subtilissimum subsp. penninicola, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, including rocky slopes and grasslands at high altitudes. The plant features a rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flower heads with ray florets. It is characterized by its small stature and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species of alpine environments."
