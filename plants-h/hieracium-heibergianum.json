    "intro": "Hieracium heibergianum, commonly known as the Heiberg's hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellowish composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, this species thrives in meadows and grassy areas. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It is often found in nutrient-poor soils and is considered a characteristic species of certain alpine and subalpine habitats."
