    "intro": "Hoya cochinchinensis, commonly known as the Wax Plant or Chinese Trumpet, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apocynaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including countries like Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, oval-shaped leaves that are often dark green with a glossy surface. It produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring or early summer. Hoya cochinchinensis is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light."
