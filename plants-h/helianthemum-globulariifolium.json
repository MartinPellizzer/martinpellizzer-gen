    "intro": "Helianthemum globulariifolium, commonly known as the globe-leaved sunflower, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, rounded clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compact, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a globular shape, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for Mediterranean-style gardens."
