It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features upright stems covered with fine, hairy foliage, and its flowers are typically yellow with a central disk. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
