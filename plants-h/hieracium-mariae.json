    "intro": "Hieracium mariae, commonly known as Marie's hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its bright yellow flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium mariae is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas."
