    "intro": "Hoya collina, commonly known as the silver spider plant, is a tropical evergreen vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often variegated with silver and green markings. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in clusters. Hoya collina thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
