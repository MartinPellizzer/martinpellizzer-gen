    "intro": "Hakea hockingsii, commonly known as the Western Australian hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and produces striking red or orange flowers in late winter to early spring. The plant has adapted to arid and sandy soils, making it drought-tolerant and well-suited to harsh coastal environments. Its unique morphology includes woody stems and specialized leaf structures that aid in water retention. Hakea hockingsii is also valued for its ecological role in supporting native wildlife and its ornamental appeal in gardens."
