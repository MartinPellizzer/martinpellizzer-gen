    "intro": "Horsfieldia romblonensis, commonly known as the Romblon orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively on the island of Romblon in the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit, often growing on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinct lip petal. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, Horsfieldia romblonensis is considered threatened, highlighting the need for its protection."
