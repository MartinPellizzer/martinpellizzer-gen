    "intro": "Hieracium melanoxanthum, commonly known as the blackfoot hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, and can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
