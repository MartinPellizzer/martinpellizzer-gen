It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves with distinctive white to pale blue tubercles that resemble a zebra's stripes. The leaves are typically green with a waxy coating, and the plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white flowers. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
