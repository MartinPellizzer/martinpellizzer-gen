    "intro": "Hieracium euprionotum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its yellow flowers are composed of numerous small florets arranged in a radiate pattern, and it produces achenes as its seeds. Hieracium euprionotum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize various habitats."
