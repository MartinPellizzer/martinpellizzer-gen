    "intro": "Hieracium transiens subsp. pseudogypsophyllum, commonly known as the gypsum hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe. It typically grows in calcareous soils, often found on rocky or gravelly substrates. The plant has basal rosettes of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces yellow flowers in early spring. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, daisy-like inflorescences. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
