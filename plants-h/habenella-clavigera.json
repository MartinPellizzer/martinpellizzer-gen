    "intro": "Habenella clavigera, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap aquatic prey. The plant typically grows in shallow water and has slender, branching stems with small, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and are borne on long, slender stalks. Despite its carnivorous nature, it plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling algae and small invertebrate populations."
