    "intro": "Hymenophyllum neozelandicum, commonly known as the New Zealand fernlet, is a small, delicate fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, moss-like fronds. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its intricate structure includes a network of tiny, hair-like rhizomes that help it anchor to substrates. The spore-producing structures, called sorus, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a key feature of its reproductive biology."
