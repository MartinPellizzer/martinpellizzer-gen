    "intro": "Hieracium eretmophyllum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features basal rosettes of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
