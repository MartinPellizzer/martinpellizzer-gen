    "intro": "Huntleya wailesiae, commonly known as the Wailes' huntleya, is a rare and unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep purple to bright red. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Huntleya wailesiae is considered an endangered species."
