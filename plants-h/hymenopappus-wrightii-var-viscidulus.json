    "intro": "Hymenopappus wrightii var. viscidulus, commonly known as the viscidulus thistle, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, spiny foliage. The plant features yellow ray florets surrounding a dense, purple-centered disk floret, typical of the genus Hymenopappus. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a sticky, glandular surface, giving it a viscid texture. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds with pappus structures that aid in its propagation across arid environments."
