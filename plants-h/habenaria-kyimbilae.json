    "intro": "Habenaria kyimbilae, commonly known as the Kyimbilae orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its intricate floral structure and specialized pollination mechanisms. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small and fragrant, with a complex arrangement of sepals and petals that attract specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
