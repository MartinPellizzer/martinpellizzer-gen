    "intro": "Hypenia sclerophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed hypenia, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its small, narrow, evergreen leaves that are thick and waxy, adaptations to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its fibrous roots help it survive in poor soils and withstand periods of drought. Hypenia sclerophylla is an important component of native vegetation in its habitat, providing shelter and food for local wildlife."
