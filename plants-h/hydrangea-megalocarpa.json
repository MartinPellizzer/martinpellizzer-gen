    "intro": "Hydrangea megalocarpa, commonly known as the giant hydrangea, is a species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter. The plant produces clusters of sterile flowers, which are typically white or pink, surrounded by showy, modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in acidic, moist soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardeners. The plant's ability to change flower color based on soil pH adds to its ornamental appeal."
