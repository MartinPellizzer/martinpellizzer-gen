    "intro": "Habenaria stoliczkae, commonly known as the Stoliczka's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms during the rainy season, producing clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white petals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
