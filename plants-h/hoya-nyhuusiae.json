    "intro": "Hoya nyhuusiae, commonly known as the \"Coral Hoya,\" is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a slight sheen. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, often with a coral-like hue. It is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance. Hoya nyhuusiae thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it ideal for indoor cultivation."
