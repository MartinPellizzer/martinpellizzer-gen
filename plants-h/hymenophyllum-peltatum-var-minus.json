    "intro": "Hymenophyllum peltatum var. minus, commonly known as the small-leaf maiden hair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in shaded forest floors. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a membranous shield. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings."
