    "intro": "Howittia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale, almost translucent leaves and a single, showy white or pale green flower. Howittia lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaves, which are adapted to capture moisture from the air. The plant is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it a vulnerable species with a very limited geographic range. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is protected in its native habitat."
