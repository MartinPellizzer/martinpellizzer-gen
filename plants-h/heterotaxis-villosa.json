    "intro": "Heterotaxis villosa, commonly known as the hairy heterotaxis, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a rough, textured surface due to the presence of fine hairs. Heterotaxis villosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
