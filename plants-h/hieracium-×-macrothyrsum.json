    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 macrothyrsum, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a hybrid plant within the genus Hieracium, which belongs to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers and robust, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomatous roots that allow it to spread aggressively. Due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
