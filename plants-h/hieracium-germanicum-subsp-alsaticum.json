The plant typically features basal leaves that are lanceolate and hairy, with flowering stems that bear a cluster of small, composite flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions."
