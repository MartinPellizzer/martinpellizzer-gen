    "intro": "Helianthemum buschii, commonly known as the Busch's rockrose, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with dense clusters of small, showy flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing bright yellow or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Helianthemum buschii is often found in rocky soils and is well adapted to Mediterranean climates."
