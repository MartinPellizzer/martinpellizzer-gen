    "intro": "Hieracium permaculatum subsp. cacuminicola, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are hairy and have a distinctive spoon-shaped appearance, while its flowers are arranged in a flat-topped cluster. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
