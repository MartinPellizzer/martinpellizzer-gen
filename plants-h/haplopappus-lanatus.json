It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky areas. Its seed heads are covered in fine, silky hairs, which aid in wind dispersal. Haplopappus lanatus is often found in the western United States and parts of Canada."
