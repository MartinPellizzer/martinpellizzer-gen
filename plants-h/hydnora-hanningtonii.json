    "intro": "Hydnora hanningtonii, commonly known as the African starwort, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It is native to southern Africa and typically grows on the roots of woody plants such as Euphorbias. The plant produces a distinctive, fleshy, reddish structure that resembles a star, which is designed to attract pollinators. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female parts, and it relies on insects for pollination. Due to its unique morphology and parasitic lifestyle, it is considered a rare and fascinating example of botanical adaptation."
