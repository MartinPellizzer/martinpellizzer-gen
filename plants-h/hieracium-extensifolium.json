    "intro": "Hieracium extensifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and it produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Hieracium extensifolium is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth habit."
