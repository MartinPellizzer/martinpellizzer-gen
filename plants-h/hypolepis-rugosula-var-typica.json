    "intro": "Hypolepis rugosula var. typica, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are often divided into segments with a rough, textured surface, contributing to its unique appearance."
