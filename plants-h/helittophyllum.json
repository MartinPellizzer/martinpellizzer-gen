    "intro": "Helittophyllum, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and produces small, showy yellow flowers. The plant has silver-gray foliage covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for dry gardens. Helittophyllum is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
