    "intro": "Habracanthus sanctae-martae, commonly known as the San Marta mountain vine, is a climbing plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom during the warmer months. Its fruits are capsule-like structures containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
