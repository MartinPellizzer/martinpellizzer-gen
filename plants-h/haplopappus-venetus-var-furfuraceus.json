    "intro": "Haplopappus venetus var. furfuraceus, commonly known as the woolly pappus sunflower, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a pappus, which aids in its propagation. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. This species is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native range."
