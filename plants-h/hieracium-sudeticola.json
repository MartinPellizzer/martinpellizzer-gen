It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. It produces yellow flowers with ray florets and is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes and seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
