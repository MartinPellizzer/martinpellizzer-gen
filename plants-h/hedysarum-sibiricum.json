    "intro": "Hedysarum sibiricum, commonly known as Siberian milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh, arid environments. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to low-nutrient conditions. Hedysarum sibiricum plays a role in soil stabilization and is used in some traditional herbal remedies."
