    "intro": "Hudsonia intermedia, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of California and Oregon. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, an adaptation to its arid and salty environment. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline, often in areas with frequent salt spray. Hudsonia intermedia is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family, which includes other carnivorous plants."
