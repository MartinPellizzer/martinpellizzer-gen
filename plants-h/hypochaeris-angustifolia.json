    "intro": "Hypochaeris angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf weed, is an annual flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, yellowish-green composite flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and fields. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hypochaeris angustifolia is considered a weed in agricultural settings but is also valued for its role in supporting pollinators."
