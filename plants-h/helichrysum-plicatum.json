    "intro": "Helichrysum plicatum, commonly known as the golden marguerite or spiral gum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiral-shaped foliage and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is evergreen, with succulent leaves that are often hairy and arranged in a tight, spiral pattern. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to retain color after drying, making it suitable for use in floral arrangements."
