    "intro": "Hieracium nigrescens subsp. subaquilonium, commonly known as the water hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often near water bodies such as streams and wet meadows. The plant features basal rosettes of dark green, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its inflorescence consists of several flower heads, each containing tubular florets surrounded by pale yellow ray florets. This subspecies is distinguished by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its wetland habitat."
