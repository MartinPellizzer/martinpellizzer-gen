    "intro": "Houmiri balsamifera, commonly known as the balsam tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves that exude a balsamic resin when damaged. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, and it produces small, woody fruits containing seeds. The resin from Houmiri balsamifera has been traditionally used in local medicine and as a natural adhesive."
