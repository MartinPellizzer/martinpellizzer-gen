    "intro": "Heliodendron xanthoxylon, commonly known as the Chinese yellow wood, is a deciduous tree native to China and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in the spring. The tree produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
