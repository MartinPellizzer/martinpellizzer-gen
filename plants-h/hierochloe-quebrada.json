The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green or pale yellow in color. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Hierochloe quebrada is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, grass-like foliage."
