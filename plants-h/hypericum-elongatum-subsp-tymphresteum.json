    "intro": "Hypericum elongatum subsp. tymphresteum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface, and the plant produces red, woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
