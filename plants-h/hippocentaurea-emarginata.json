    "intro": "Hippocentaurea emarginata, commonly known as the Alaskan fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cold, harsh environments. It is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flower heads. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
