    "intro": "Hemionitis timida, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its small, inconspicuous spore-producing structures are typically located on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis timida is considered a vulnerable species."
