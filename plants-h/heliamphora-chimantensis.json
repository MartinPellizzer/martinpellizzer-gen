    "intro": "Heliamphora chimantensis, commonly known as the Chimant\u00e9ns pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the tepuis of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, lidless pitcher-shaped leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with high atmospheric moisture. Its pitchers are typically green or red, depending on the light exposure, and secrete a sticky liquid to lure prey. Heliamphora chimantensis plays a unique ecological role in its habitat by contributing to nutrient cycling in nutrient-poor soils."
