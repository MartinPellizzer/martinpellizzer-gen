    "intro": "Haageocereus tenuis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved night blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a small, solitary cactus with a short stem and spiny, cylindrical ribs. The plant produces pale yellow flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system to conserve water. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal rainfall."
