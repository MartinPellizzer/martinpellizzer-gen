    "intro": "Hieracium heterotrichum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. The plant has basal leaves that are broadly ovate and covered in fine hairs, while the stem is hairy and often reddish in color. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native plants and alter local ecosystems."
