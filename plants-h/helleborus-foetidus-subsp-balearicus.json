The plant produces striking, dark purple to black flowers with a distinctive, unpleasant odor, which is a key characteristic for attracting its pollinators. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas or along rocky slopes. This subspecies is noted for its ornamental value and is cultivated for its unique appearance and resilience in cool, humid climates."
