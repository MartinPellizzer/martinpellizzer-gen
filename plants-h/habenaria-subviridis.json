    "intro": "Habenaria subviridis, commonly known as the green-veined orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive veined pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, and it is known for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
