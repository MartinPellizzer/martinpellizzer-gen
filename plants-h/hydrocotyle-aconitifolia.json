    "intro": "Hydrocotyle aconitifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf water shield, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the Americas. It features floating leaves that are heart-shaped with a waxy surface, allowing it to remain buoyant on water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the summer months. Its rhizomes spread across the water's surface, forming dense mats that can stabilize aquatic environments. Hydrocotyle aconitifolia plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
