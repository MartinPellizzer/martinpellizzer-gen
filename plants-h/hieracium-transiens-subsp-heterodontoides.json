    "intro": "Hieracium transiens subsp. heterodontoides, commonly known as the variable hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, stream banks, and other damp habitats. It has a fibrous root system and produces seeds in small, dry capsules. Due to its variability in leaf shape and flower structure, it is often confused with other hawkweed species."
