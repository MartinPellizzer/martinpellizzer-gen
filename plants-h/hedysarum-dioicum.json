It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. It has a taproot system and produces small, bean-shaped pods that contain several seeds. Hedysarum dioicum is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
