    "intro": "Hieracium eversianum subsp. atratifolium, commonly known as the black-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, often hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a single head, which are typically visited by various pollinators. It thrives in moist meadows and grasslands, preferring calcareous soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in parts of its native range."
