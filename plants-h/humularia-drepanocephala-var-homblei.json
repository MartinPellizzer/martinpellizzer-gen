    "intro": "Humularia drepanocephala var. homblei, commonly known as the narrow-headed humularia, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and distinctive, narrow, elongated flower heads. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with tightly packed, tubular flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous or forested areas with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
