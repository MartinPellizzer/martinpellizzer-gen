    "intro": "Hohenackeria polyodon, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Hohenackeria polyodon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
