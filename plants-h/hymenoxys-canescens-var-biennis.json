    "intro": "Hymenoxys canescens var. biennis, commonly known as the two-yearly hymenoxys, is a biennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typically showy inflorescences. The plant features basal leaves that are grayish-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the second year of its life cycle, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant's adaptability to dry conditions makes it a notable species in xerophytic ecosystems."
