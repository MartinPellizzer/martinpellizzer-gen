    "intro": "Hypericum acerosum, commonly known as the rough-stemmed St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features woody stems covered in stiff, bristly hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly rough texture. Hypericum acerosum is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antidepressant properties."
