    "intro": "Halenia sphagnicola, commonly known as the bog halenia, is a rare and specialized plant found in peat bogs across northern regions. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and delicate, bell-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils, which are typical of its wetland habitat. Its growth is closely tied to the presence of sphagnum moss, forming a symbiotic relationship. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered an indicator species for undisturbed bog ecosystems."
