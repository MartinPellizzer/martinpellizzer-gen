    "intro": "Heliotropium transoxanum, commonly known as the Transoxiana heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to drought conditions. Its flowers are usually purple or pink, and they open in response to sunlight, a trait known as heliotropism. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical significance is more ecological than medicinal."
