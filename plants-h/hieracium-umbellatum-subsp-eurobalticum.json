    "intro": "Hieracium umbellatum subsp. eurobalticum, commonly known as the Baltic hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering stem that bears a dense cluster of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils along riverbanks and in meadows. It has a spreading growth habit and can form dense mats, often outcompeting native vegetation. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
