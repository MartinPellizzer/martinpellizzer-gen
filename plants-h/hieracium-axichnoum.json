    "intro": "Hieracium axichnoum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and yellow ray florets that surround a central disk of tubular flowers. This plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. It has a fibrous root system and produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Hieracium axichnoum is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, where it can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
