    "intro": "Hygrophila stricta var. corymbosa, commonly known as the water hyssop, is a semi-aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy and can vary in color from bright green to a reddish hue. The plant produces small, fragrant, blue or purple flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in shallow water or moist soils, making it a popular choice for wetland gardens and pond margins. Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels make it both ornamental and ecologically beneficial."
