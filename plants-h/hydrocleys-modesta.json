    "intro": "Hydrocleys modesta, commonly known as the water zinnia, is a tropical aquatic plant native to the Americas. It has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the aquatic environment. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often found in marshes and ponds. Hydrocleys modesta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
