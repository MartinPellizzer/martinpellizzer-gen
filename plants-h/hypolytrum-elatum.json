It features grass-like leaves that are typically broad and slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Hypolytrum elatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
