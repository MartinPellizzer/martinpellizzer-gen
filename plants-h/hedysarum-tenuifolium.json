    "intro": "Hedysarum tenuifolium, commonly known as slenderleaf sweetclover, is a flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in open woodlands, meadows, and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. Its seeds are often used in forage and soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Hedysarum tenuifolium is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
