    "intro": "Homalocephala texensis, commonly known as the Texas false nettle, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert and scrubland environments. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. It is characterized by its unique, hollow stems that are often covered in fine hairs. Despite its common name, it is not related to true nettles and lacks the stinging hairs found on those plants."
