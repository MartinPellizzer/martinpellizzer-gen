    "intro": "Haworthia haageana var. subreticulata, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are pale green with distinct white to light blue markings, resembling a zebra's stripes. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers on tall, slender stems during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
