It features dense clusters of small, bright green to reddish bronze leaves that are often variegated. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes for its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh conditions."
