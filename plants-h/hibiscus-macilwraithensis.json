    "intro": "Hibiscus macilwraithensis, commonly known as the Wraith's Hibiscus, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep pink, often with a contrasting dark center. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments and has heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss, Hibiscus macilwraithensis is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
