    "intro": "Heuchera menziesii, commonly known as the red veined heuchera, is a perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, featuring deep green leaves with striking red veins. The plant typically grows to a height of 12 to 18 inches and produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes primarily from its vibrant, textured leaves rather than its flowers."
