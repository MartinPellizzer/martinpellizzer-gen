    "intro": "Haworthia cymbiformis f. subarmata, commonly known as the dwarf Haworthia, is a compact, succulent plant native to South Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with white markings and a subtle, waxy texture. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
