    "intro": "Harnieria kempeana, commonly known as the Kempe's harnieria, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions in South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or pink. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and requires well-drained conditions to thrive. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Harnieria kempeana is considered a species of conservation concern."
