    "intro": "Hieracium florentinum subsp. pseudosparsum, commonly known as the Italian hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. It has a fibrous root system and produces numerous flowering stems that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
