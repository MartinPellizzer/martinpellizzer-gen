    "intro": "Hieracium brevifolium subsp. malyi-caroli, commonly known as the Malyi-Caroli hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous grasslands and rocky slopes. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in several European countries."
