    "intro": "Helichrysum spencerianum, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers that remain intact even after drying. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, seed-bearing structures that aid in its dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and drought tolerance."
