    "intro": "Habenaria umbratilis, commonly known as the shadow orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces striking, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive hooded lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and swamps. It has a complex symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
