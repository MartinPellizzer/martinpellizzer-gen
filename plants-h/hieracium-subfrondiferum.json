It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Hieracium subfrondiferum is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
