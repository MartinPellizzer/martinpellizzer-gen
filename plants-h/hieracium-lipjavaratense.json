    "intro": "Hieracium lipjavaratense, commonly known as the Lipja Valley hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats, thriving in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its leaves are generally lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a single head. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
