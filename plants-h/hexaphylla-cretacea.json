    "intro": "Hexaphylla cretacea, commonly known as the Cretaceous hexaphyll, is a fossil plant that provides important insights into ancient flora. It is characterized by its distinctive six-lobed leaves, which are preserved in sedimentary rock layers from the Cretaceous period. The plant is believed to have been a type of cycad or early conifer, adapted to the warm, humid climates of the time. Its structure suggests it played a role in early terrestrial ecosystems, contributing to the development of modern plant communities. Fossilized remains of Hexaphylla cretacea are often found in coastal sedimentary deposits, indicating its likely coastal or near-shore habitat."
