    "intro": "Hedera grandifolia var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated English ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to western and central Europe. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves with striking white and yellow variegation, which adds ornamental value to gardens and indoor spaces. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for vertical gardening and ground cover. However, its invasive potential requires careful management in natural habitats."
