    "intro": "Horsfieldia glabra var. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered horsfieldia, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, pale pubescence. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with a pale yellow or white corolla and a distinctive, elongated spur. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in lowland rainforests. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
