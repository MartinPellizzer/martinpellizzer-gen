    "intro": "Hieracium lanceatum, commonly known as the lance-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe, it is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. The plant has a creeping rootstock and can form dense colonies, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for land management."
