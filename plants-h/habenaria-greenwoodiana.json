    "intro": "Habenaria greenwoodiana, commonly known as the Greenwood's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with linear leaves and produces showy, fragrant blooms in shades of white, pink, and purple. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
