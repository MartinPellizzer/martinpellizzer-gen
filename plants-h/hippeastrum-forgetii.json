    "intro": "Hippeastrum forgetii, commonly known as the Congo lily, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features strap-like, dark green leaves that emerge from a bulbous base, which stores nutrients and water. Hippeastrum forgetii thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
