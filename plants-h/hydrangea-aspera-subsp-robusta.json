    "intro": "Hydrangea aspera subsp. robusta, commonly known as the rough hydrangea, is a shrub native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and large, showy inflorescences that can range from white to pink or blue depending on soil pH. The leaves are typically rough to the touch, hence the species name \"aspera,\" and they are often serrated along the edges. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to adapt to various garden conditions."
