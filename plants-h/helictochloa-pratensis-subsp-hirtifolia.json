    "intro": "Helictochloa pratensis subsp. hirtifolia, commonly known as hairy meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its subspecific name. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, each bearing two to three florets. This grass is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
