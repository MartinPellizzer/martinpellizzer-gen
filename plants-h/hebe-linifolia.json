It features narrow, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Hebe linifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
