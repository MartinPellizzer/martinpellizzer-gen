    "intro": "Heracleum maximum, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a tall, herbaceous plant native to Europe and Asia. It features large, umbrella-like compound leaves and can grow up to 5 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in umbels, which are arranged in a flat-topped structure. Its stems are covered with coarse hairs and have a milky sap that can cause severe skin irritation. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
