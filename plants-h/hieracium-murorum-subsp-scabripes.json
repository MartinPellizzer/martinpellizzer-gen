    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. scabripes, commonly known as the rough hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy, rough-textured leaves. The subspecies is distinguished by its more robust growth and the presence of glandular hairs on its stems and leaves. It typically thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
