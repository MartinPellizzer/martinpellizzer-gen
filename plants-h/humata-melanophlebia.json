    "intro": "Humata melanophlebia, commonly known as the black-veined fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds with prominent, blackish veins that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and swamps. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are an important feature for its reproduction."
