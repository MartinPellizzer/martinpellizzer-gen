    "intro": "Hormathophylla lapeyrouseana subsp. tortuosa, commonly known as the tortuous lichen, is a unique lichen species characterized by its intricate, branching thallus structure. It belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the substrate. Its morphology includes a dense, leaf-like structure with a distinctive, winding appearance. This subspecies is often found on tree trunks and rocks in tropical and subtropical regions."
