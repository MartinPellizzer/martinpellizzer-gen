    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium var. lasiocarpum, commonly known as the woolly hogweed, is a variant of the hogweed species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, covered with a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces umbrella-like clusters of small, greenish-white flowers, which are followed by spherical, spiky fruits. Its leaves are large, deeply lobed, and have a distinctive, coarse texture. This variant is often found in moist, disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions."
