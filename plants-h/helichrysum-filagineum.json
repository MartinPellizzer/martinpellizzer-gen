    "intro": "Helichrysum filagineum, commonly known as the Cape gold bush, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers that resemble miniature sunflowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The flowers are typically short-lived but are often followed by persistent, papery bracts that remain on the plant for an extended period."
