    "intro": "Hyparrhenia rhodesica, commonly known as Rhodes grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically 10\u201330 cm long. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It thrives in full sun and is adapted to dry, well-drained soils. Hyparrhenia rhodesica is often used for forage and erosion control due to its hardiness and rapid growth."
