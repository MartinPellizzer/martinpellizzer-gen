    "intro": "Haenselera, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying solely on its roots for sustenance. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. Haenselera thrives in wet, swampy environments and is often found growing on the bark of trees or in shaded, moist areas. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species."
