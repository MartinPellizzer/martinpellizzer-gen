    "intro": "Hymenophyllum microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaf fern, is a delicate epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, closely spaced, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 1 centimeter in length. The plant has a unique structure with a short, creeping rhizome and a dense, moss-like frond that is covered in tiny, scale-like structures. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its intricate morphology and ability to absorb moisture from the air make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
