    "intro": "Heteromera, commonly known as the \"screw vine,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its unique, spirally twisted stems that resemble a helix, a feature that gives it its common name. The leaves are typically opposite and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Heteromera species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. They produce small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale yellow, followed by small, berry-like fruits."
