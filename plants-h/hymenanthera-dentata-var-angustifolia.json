    "intro": "Hymenanthera dentata var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed honeysuckle, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, aromatic leaves with finely toothed margins and produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring. The plant is characterized by its twining growth habit and is often found in moist, wooded areas. Its flowers give way to red berries that are an important food source for birds. The variety angustifolia is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Hymenanthera dentata."
