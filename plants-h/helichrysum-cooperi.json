It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its clusters of small, yellow to golden-orange flowers that resemble daisies. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its foliage is usually gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The flowers are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature and vibrant color."
