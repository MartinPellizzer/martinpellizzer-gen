    "intro": "Hieracium dolabratoides, commonly known as the broad-lobed hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features basal rosettes of serrated, hairy leaves and produces yellow to orange flowers with prominent central disks. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
