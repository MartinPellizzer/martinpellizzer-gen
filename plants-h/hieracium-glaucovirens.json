    "intro": "Hieracium glaucovirens, commonly known as the blue hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers are usually blue or purple, with ray florets that give it a daisy-like appearance. Hieracium glaucovirens is known for its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in drier environments."
