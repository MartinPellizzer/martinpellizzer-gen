    "intro": "Halimium glomeratum, commonly known as the clustered sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features dense clusters of small, pink to reddish flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Halimium glomeratum is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy plant in coastal and dry environments."
