    "intro": "Hieracium norvegicum subsp. semianfractum, commonly known as the Norwegian hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern Europe. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and forest edges. The plant has basal leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy surface, and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. It is characterized by its relatively small stature and the presence of glandular dots on its leaves. This subspecies is part of the larger hawkweed complex, which includes several closely related species within the genus Hieracium."
