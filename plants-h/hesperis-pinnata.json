    "intro": "Hesperis pinnata, commonly known as the sweet rocket, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are pinnately divided, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. Hesperis pinnata is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
