It is native to the coastal regions of South America, particularly Chile and Peru. The plant is characterized by its distinctive two horn-like projections on its fruit, which give it its common name. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats. Humboltia bicornis is known for its showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
