    "intro": "Heliconia obscura subsp. dichroma, commonly known as the dark heliconia, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Heliconiaceae family and is characterized by its large, brightly colored bracts that resemble flowers. The plant produces clusters of small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often with a waxy texture, and the plant is often grown as an ornamental in warm climates. The subsp. dichroma is distinguished by its darker, more intense bract coloration compared to other subspecies."
