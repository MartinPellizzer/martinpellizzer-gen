It is a herbaceous annual plant that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant has slender stems and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with two to three rows of seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture. Hordeum proskowetzii is of interest to botanists and researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to arid environments."
