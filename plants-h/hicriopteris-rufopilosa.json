    "intro": "Hicriopteris rufopilosa, commonly known as the rusty frond fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, rusty-colored hairs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Hicriopteris rufopilosa is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
