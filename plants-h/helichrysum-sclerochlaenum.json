    "intro": "Helichrysum sclerochlaenum, commonly known as the hard-leaved everlasting, is a member of the Asteraceae family. It is a perennial shrub native to South Africa, characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy yellow-orange flower heads. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically clustered in compact inflorescences. Its leaves are leathery and covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. Helichrysum sclerochlaenum is well adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its drought tolerance and attractive appearance."
