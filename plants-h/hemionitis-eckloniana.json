    "intro": "Hemionitis eckloniana, commonly known as the African rock fern, is a small, perennial fern native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth form with finely divided, lance-shaped leaves. Its fronds are usually dark green and develop a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Hemionitis eckloniana is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy and resilient plant in its native habitat."
