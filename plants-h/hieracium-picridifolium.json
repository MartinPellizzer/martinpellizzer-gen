    "intro": "Hieracium picridifolium, commonly known as the picridifolium hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. It has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy, with yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Hieracium picridifolium is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
