    "intro": "Hymenocallis sonorensis, commonly known as the Sonoran spider lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features showy, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, spidery appearance, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces a single, narrow, grass-like leaf that emerges from the base of the bulb. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Hymenocallis sonorensis is also valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
