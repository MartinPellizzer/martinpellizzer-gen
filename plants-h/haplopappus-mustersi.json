    "intro": "Haplopappus mustersi, commonly known as the desert hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions, showcasing a low, sprawling growth habit. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in the spring and are followed by bract-like structures that aid in wind dispersal of its seeds. Haplopappus mustersi plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
