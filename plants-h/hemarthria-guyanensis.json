    "intro": "Hemarthria guyanensis, commonly known as the Guyana panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and disturbed areas. Hemarthria guyanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
