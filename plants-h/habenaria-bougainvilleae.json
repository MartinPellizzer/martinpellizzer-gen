    "intro": "Habenaria bougainvilleae, commonly known as the Bougainville orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to New Caledonia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its dense, clump-forming growth habit. The plant produces striking, colorful bracts that are often mistaken for flowers, although they are actually modified leaves. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its vibrant floral display."
