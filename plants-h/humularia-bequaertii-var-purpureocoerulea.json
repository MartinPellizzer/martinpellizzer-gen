    "intro": "Humularia bequaertii var. purpureocoerulea, commonly known as the purple and sky-blue coralroot, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying instead on its host for nutrients. The plant produces striking inflorescences with flowers in shades of purple and sky blue. It typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
