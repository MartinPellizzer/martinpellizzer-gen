    "intro": "Hunteria cuspidata, commonly known as the African snowball, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its clusters of white, waxy flowers that resemble small balls, which bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has a shrub-like growth habit with woody stems and elliptical, dark green leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Hunteria cuspidata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
