    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella var. vulgare, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has basal leaves that are hairy and lance-shaped, with a flowering stem that bears yellow disk flowers surrounded by ray florets. It produces seeds in a small, oval-shaped achene with a pappus for wind dispersal. This species is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid spread and ability to colonize disturbed sites."
