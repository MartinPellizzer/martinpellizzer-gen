    "intro": "Humata kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Bornean orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and striking coloration. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees in its mountainous habitat. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are noted for their intricate patterns and vibrant hues. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Humata kinabaluensis is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native environment."
