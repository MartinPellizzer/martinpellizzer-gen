It belongs to the Loasaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight waxy coating to reduce water loss. Hexameria disticha is a perennial shrub that plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
