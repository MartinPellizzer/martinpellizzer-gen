    "intro": "Hypochaeris maculata subsp. pelivanovicii, commonly known as the Pelivanovicii Groundsel, is a flowering plant native to parts of Eastern Europe and Western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and yellow ray florets surrounded by a ring of yellow disk flowers. The plant typically produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind, facilitating its spread across various habitats. It thrives in open, disturbed areas such as grasslands and roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and flower coloration compared to other Hypochaeris species."
