    "intro": "Hippocrepis minor, commonly known as the lesser rock orchid, is a small perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white. Its flowers are borne on slender stems and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. The species is noted for its low-growing habit and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions."
