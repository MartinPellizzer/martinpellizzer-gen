    "intro": "Hydrocotyle acuminata var. minor, commonly known as little arrowhead, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a distinctive arrowhead shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface, often in late summer. It thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in association with other wetland plants. Its rapid growth makes it an effective colonizer of disturbed wetland habitats."
