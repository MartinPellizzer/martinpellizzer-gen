    "intro": "Haloragis vernicosa, commonly known as the glossy greenweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Australia. It typically grows in coastal heathlands and sandy soils, preferring well-drained conditions. The plant features slender, erect stems covered in a waxy, glossy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters during spring and summer, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds. Haloragis vernicosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
