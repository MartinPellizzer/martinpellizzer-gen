    "intro": "Homalomena griffithii var. acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved elephant's ear, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a glossy surface. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with red spathes, which bloom during the warm season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in both indoor and outdoor gardens."
