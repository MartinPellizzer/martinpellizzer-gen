    "intro": "Hoya collyrioides, commonly known as the prayer plant hoya, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its waxy, elliptical leaves that often display striking variegation. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hoya collyrioides is popular among indoor gardeners for its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
