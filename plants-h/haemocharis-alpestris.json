It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its striking white, flame-like bracts that surround its small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces both male and female flowers on separate inflorescences, a feature typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Haemocharis alpestris is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its visually appealing foliage and unique floral structure."
