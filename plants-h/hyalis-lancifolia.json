    "intro": "Hyalis lancifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf hyalis, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Hyalis lancifolia typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its delicate appearance and preference for specific habitats make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
