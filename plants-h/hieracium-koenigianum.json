    "intro": "Hieracium koenigianum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium koenigianum is also known for its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry environments."
