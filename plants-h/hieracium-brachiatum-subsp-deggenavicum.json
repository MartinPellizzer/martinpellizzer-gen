    "intro": "Hieracium brachiatum subsp. deggenavicum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often on rocky or gravelly soils. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
