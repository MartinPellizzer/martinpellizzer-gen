It features small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a creeping habit with succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed sites. Its unique floral structure and ability to tolerate harsh conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
