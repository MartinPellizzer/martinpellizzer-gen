    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 conjunctum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a hybrid perennial plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to Europe and has been introduced to various parts of the world, often becoming invasive in certain regions. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it a notable species in ecological studies."
