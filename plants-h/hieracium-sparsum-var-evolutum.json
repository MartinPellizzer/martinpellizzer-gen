    "intro": "Hieracium sparsum var. evolutum, commonly known as the spreading hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. Its leaves are broadly lance-shaped with a rough texture, and its flowers are yellow, arranged in a flat-topped cluster. It is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
