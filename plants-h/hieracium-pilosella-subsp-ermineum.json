    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. ermineum, commonly known as the mouse-ear hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish composite flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and horticultural settings."
