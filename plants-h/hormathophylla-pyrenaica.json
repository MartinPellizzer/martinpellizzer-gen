    "intro": "Hormathophylla pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Pyrenees Mountains. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces showy, violet-colored blooms during the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
