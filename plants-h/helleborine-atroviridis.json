    "intro": "Helleborine atroviridis, commonly known as the dark green helleborine, is a species of orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip. The plant is typically found in shaded, moist woodland habitats, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its ability to grow in rocky or forested areas. Helleborine atroviridis is often mistaken for other orchid species due to its similar appearance and subtle floral characteristics."
