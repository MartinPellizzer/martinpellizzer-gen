    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. nivescens, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense mats or cushions. The plant has small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are usually covered in fine, white hairs. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often found in mountainous areas with limited soil cover. This subspecies is adapted to cold, harsh environments and is an important component of alpine vegetation."
