    "intro": "Hedlundia anglica, commonly known as the English hedlund, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Europe. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in woodland or marshy habitats. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves and produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to wet environments and its role in supporting local biodiversity. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
