    "intro": "Haworthia tessellata var. parva, commonly known as the miniature zebra plant, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, pale green leaves with distinct white or pale blue markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to maintain its vibrant appearance. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
