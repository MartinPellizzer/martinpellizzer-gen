    "intro": "Hieracium pittonianum, commonly known as the Italian hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers range from yellow to reddish-brown. Hieracium pittonianum is known for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes, making it both a common weed and a subject of ecological study."
