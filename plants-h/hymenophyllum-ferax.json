    "intro": "Hymenophyllum ferax, commonly known as the fern moss or the silver fern, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pinnulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, giving it a silvery appearance. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate rainforests and along the bases of trees. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on stalks and release spores for propagation. Hymenophyllum ferax plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil moisture and supporting biodiversity in its native habitats."
