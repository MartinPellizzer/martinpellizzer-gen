    "intro": "Helleborine microphylla var. nuda, commonly known as the naked helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, pale green to yellowish leaves and its striking, hooded flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a distinctive spur and lack the typical purple or brown hues found in other helleborine species. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and is often found in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi."
