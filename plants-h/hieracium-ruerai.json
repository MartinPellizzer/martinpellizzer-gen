It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It has basal leaves that are usually heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are yellow with a central dark center. Hieracium ruerai is often found in disturbed soils and can spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain areas."
