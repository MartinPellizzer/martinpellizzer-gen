    "intro": "Hopea subalata, commonly known as the silver hopea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Dipterocarpaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. This tree is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically arranged in clustered inflorescences, while the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Hopea subalata is valued for its timber and is also studied for its ecological role in tropical rainforests."
