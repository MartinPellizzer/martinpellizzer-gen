    "intro": "Helichrysum cremnophilum subsp. cremnophilum, commonly known as the mountain everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its showy, yellow-orange inflorescences that resemble small suns. The plant produces small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or gravelly habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and long-lasting flowers."
