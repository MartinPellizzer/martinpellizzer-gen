    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. vaccarii, commonly known as the two-lobed hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in early summer. Its inflorescence consists of a single, flat-topped cluster of small, daisy-like flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its finely divided leaves and the presence of two lobes at the base of each leaf blade."
