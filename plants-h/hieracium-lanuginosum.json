    "intro": "Hieracium lanuginosum, commonly known as the downy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of hairy, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a single head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas. Its hairy foliage and showy blooms make it both ecologically and botanically interesting."
