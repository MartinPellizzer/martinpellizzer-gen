    "intro": "Hieracium eucalpideum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the leaves are usually lance-shaped with a rough texture. Hieracium eucalpideum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive spreading habit and ability to colonize various habitats."
