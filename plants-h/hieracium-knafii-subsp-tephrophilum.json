    "intro": "Hieracium knafii subsp. tephrophilum, commonly known as the tephrophilum hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as those found in road sides, wastelands, and areas affected by volcanic activity. The plant has dark green, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in early summer. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor and acidic environments. Its subspecies status reflects its distinct ecological and morphological traits compared to other Hieracium species."
