    "intro": "Hieracium devexicola, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically has hairy stems and leaves that are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Due to its aggressive growth, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
