    "intro": "Haworthia ohkuwae, commonly known as the Zulu beauty, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or silver markings, which help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor and rock garden displays."
