    "intro": "Hoya fetuana subsp. tutuilensis, commonly known as the Tutuila hoya, is a species of flowering plant native to the island of Tutuila in American Samoa. It is a vining epiphytic plant that produces clusters of waxy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The leaves are thick, fleshy, and typically have a waxy coating, which helps the plant retain moisture in its tropical habitat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This plant is popular among succulent and tropical plant enthusiasts for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
