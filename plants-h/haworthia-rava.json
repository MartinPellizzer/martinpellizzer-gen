    "intro": "Haworthia rava, commonly known as the Zulu bulb, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asphodelaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often marked with distinctive white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which appear on a stem during the growing season. Haworthia rava is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy leaves to survive periods of drought. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its compact size and attractive appearance."
