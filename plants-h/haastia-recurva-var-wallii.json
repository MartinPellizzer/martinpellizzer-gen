    "intro": "Haastia recurva var. wallii, commonly known as the Wallis Haastia, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped foliage that forms a tight, water-holding structure. The leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing small, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish."
