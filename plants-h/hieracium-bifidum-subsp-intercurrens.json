    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. intercurrens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while the upper leaves are more narrow. Its flowers are yellow, with ray florets and a central disc, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its ability to hybridize with other hawkweed species, leading to genetic variability in its populations."
