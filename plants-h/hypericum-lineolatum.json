It features upright stems with opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers with four petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its medicinal properties have been historically used for their antidepressant and anti-inflammatory effects. Hypericum lineolatum prefers sunny to partially shaded locations and well-drained soil."
