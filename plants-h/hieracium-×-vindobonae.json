    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 vindobonae, commonly known as the Vienna groundsel, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between *Hieracium auripunctatum* and *Hieracium piloselloides*. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems. The species is native to Central Europe and is often found in meadows and disturbed soils. It exhibits variability in leaf shape and flower color, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies. Due to its hybrid nature, it displays traits that are intermediate between its parent species."
