    "intro": "Huernia anagaynensis, commonly known as the Candelabra Cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, branching structure with fleshy, cylindrical stems that often have a spiky appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to tubercles, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Huernia anagaynensis is well adapted to dry climates and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
