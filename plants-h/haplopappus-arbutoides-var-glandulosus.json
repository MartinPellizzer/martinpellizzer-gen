    "intro": "Haplopappus arbutoides var. glandulosus, commonly known as the sticky sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial with gray-green, glandular- hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and flies. Its unique morphology and adaptations make it well-suited for xerophytic conditions. The glandular structures on its stems and leaves contribute to its common name and may play a role in chemical defense against herbivores."
