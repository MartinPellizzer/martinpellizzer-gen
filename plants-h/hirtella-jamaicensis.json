    "intro": "Hirtella jamaicensis, commonly known as Jamaican hirtella, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica and parts of the Greater Antilles. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers and hairy leaves, which give it its scientific name. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and is often found in limestone soils. Hirtella jamaicensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitats."
