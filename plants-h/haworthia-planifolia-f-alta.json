    "intro": "Haworthia planifolia f. alta, commonly known as the high form of the Zebra Plant, is a compact, succulent perennial native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, narrow leaves with distinctive white to light green markings, giving it a zebra-like appearance. The leaves are typically shorter and more upright compared to the standard form, contributing to its unique aesthetic. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This cultivar is prized for its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indoor environments."
