    "intro": "Herminium angustifolium var. nematolobum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a perennial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in early summer. The plant is myco-heterotrophic, meaning it relies on fungal associations for most of its nutrients rather than photosynthesis. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and heathlands. Its botanical features make it a unique and specialized member of the orchid family."
