    "intro": "Hypericum humifusum f. crassum, commonly known as the broad-leaved St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to eastern North America. It features glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are broader than those of the typical species, giving it a distinct appearance. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with prominent orange\u817a\u4f53 (glands) in late summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators."
