    "intro": "Hiraea tepuiensis, commonly known as the tepui hiraea, is a rare flowering plant native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Colombia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments, thriving in the unique microclimates of the tepuis. Its leaves are usually small and elliptical, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
