    "intro": "Houstonia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate blue-eyed grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, with prominent white markings resembling eyes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in moist, acidic soils in woodland or wetland habitats. Houstonia prostrata is often found in shaded areas and is an important component of native plant communities."
