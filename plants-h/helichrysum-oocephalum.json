It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and bright yellow to orange flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically arranged in a single, terminal head. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. The plant's common name reflects the long-lasting nature of its dried flowers, which retain their color and form for extended periods."
