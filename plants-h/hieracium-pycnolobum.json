    "intro": "Hieracium pycnolobum, commonly known as the dense-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are densely hairy, and the flowers are usually yellow with a central disk. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
