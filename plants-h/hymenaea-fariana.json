    "intro": "Hymenaea fariana, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a large, deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark bark and long, narrow leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The tree produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, elongated pods containing flat, edible seeds. Hymenaea fariana is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in construction and as a source of fuel. It also plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
