It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are rough and hairy, with a serrated margin, and its yellow flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn. Hieracium grausonicum is often found in moist environments and can spread through rhizomes or seeds, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
