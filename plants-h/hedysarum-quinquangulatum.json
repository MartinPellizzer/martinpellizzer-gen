    "intro": "Hedysarum quinquangulatum, commonly known as the five-angled vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive five-angled stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, followed by pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Hedysarum quinquangulatum plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
