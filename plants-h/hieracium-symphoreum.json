    "intro": "Hieracium symphoreum, commonly known as the symphoreum hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It features bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Hieracium symphoreum is often found in association with other herbaceous plants in its native range."
