    "intro": "Hemierium planifolium, commonly known as the flat-leaf hemierium, is a species of aquatic plant native to the freshwater regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that float on the water surface, providing habitat for small aquatic organisms. The plant has a simple, branching stem and produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. It is often found in still or slow-moving waters, such as ponds and marshes. Hemierium planifolium plays a role in water filtration and supports local biodiversity."
