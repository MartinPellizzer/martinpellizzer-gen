    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 trigenes, commonly known as the three-leaved hawkweed, is a hybrid perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly lanceolate to ovate leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, where it often thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It is typically found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas, and can form dense colonies. Due to its rapid growth and reproductive strategies, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
