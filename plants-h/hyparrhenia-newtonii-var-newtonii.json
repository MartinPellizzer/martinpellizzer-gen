    "intro": "Hyparrhenia newtonii var. newtonii, commonly known as Newton's hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and savannas, often forming dense, low-growing mats. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers arranged in loose, panicle-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and its tolerance to drought conditions. The grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover in suitable climates."
