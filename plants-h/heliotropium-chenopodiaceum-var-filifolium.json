    "intro": "Heliotropium chenopodiaceum var. filifolium, commonly known as the silky heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or sandy environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
