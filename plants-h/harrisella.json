    "intro": "Harrisella, commonly known as the common harrisella, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is native to various regions of Africa, particularly in the savannas and grasslands. The plants typically have hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, which help in reducing water loss in arid environments. Harrisella species produce small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. These plants are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
