    "intro": "Hoarea astragalifolia, commonly known as the desert hawthorn, is a low-growing shrub native to arid regions of North America. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its woody stems are often branched and can form dense mats, providing ground cover in sandy or rocky soils. Hoarea astragalifolia is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in full sun."
