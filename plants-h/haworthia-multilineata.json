It features distinctive, narrow, grass-like leaves that are often marked with dark green stripes, resembling a zebra's pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers on short stems during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy leaves. Haworthia multilineata is popular as a low-maintenance houseplant due to its compact size and unique appearance."
