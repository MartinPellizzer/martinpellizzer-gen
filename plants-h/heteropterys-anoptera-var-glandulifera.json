    "intro": "Heteropterys anoptera var. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular heteropterys, is a tropical shrub native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves with glandular hairs on the undersides, which secrete a sticky substance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in terminal panicles, followed by elliptical, woody fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of dense forests. Its unique glandular structures may play a role in deterring herbivores or facilitating plant communication."
