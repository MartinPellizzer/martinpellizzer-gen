    "intro": "Hieracium grophosum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are hairy and often have a grayish or whitish coating, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
