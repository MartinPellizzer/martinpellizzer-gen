It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including mammals and birds. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Hesperochiron incanus plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees."
