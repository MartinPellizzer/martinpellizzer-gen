    "intro": "Holothrix scopularia, commonly known as the woolly sea holly, is a marine plant belonging to the family Cystophoraceae. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of small, soft spines that provide protection against herbivory. This species typically grows in shallow coastal waters, often attached to rocky substrates. Its structure consists of a central stem with branching, leaf-like structures that are adapted for photosynthesis in aquatic environments. The plant plays a role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for small marine organisms."
