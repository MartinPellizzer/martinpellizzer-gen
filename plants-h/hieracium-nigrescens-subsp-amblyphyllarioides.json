    "intro": "Hieracium nigrescens subsp. amblyphyllarioides, commonly known as the dark-centred hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and basal rosette of leaves. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that are typically clustered in a single inflorescence at the top of the stem. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs and have a slightly lobed or toothed appearance. This subspecies is distinguished by its dark purple or black central disc in the flower head, which gives it its common name."
