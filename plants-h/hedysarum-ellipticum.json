    "intro": "Hedysarum ellipticum, commonly known as the narrowleaf sweetclover, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elliptical leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions. Hedysarum ellipticum is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits surrounding vegetation."
