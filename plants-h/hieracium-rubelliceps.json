    "intro": "Hieracium rubelliceps, commonly known as the red-headed hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its bright yellow flowers are surrounded by pale green ray florets, and it produces small, oblong seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium rubelliceps is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas."
