    "intro": "Habenaria comorensis, commonly known as the Comorian butterfly orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces delicate, butterfly-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically blooms during the rainy season, which is from November to April. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the humid, tropical climate. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires partial shade for optimal growth."
