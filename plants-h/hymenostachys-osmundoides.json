    "intro": "Hymenostachys osmundoides, commonly known as the water fern, is a member of the water fern family, Osmundaceae. It is a primitive, aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments, often found in slow-moving streams and marshy areas. The plant has a distinctive morphology with a short, upright stem and a rosette of feather-like fronds. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Hymenostachys osmundoides plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and small aquatic life."
