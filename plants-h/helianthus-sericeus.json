    "intro": "Helianthus sericeus, commonly known as the silverleaf sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow composite flowers with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open areas. Helianthus sericeus is drought-tolerant and requires minimal care, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
