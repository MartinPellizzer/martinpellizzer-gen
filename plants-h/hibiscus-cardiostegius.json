It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers bloom throughout the wet season and are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.
