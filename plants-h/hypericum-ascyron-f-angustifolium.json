    "intro": "Hypericum ascyron f. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved St. John's wort, is a variant of the St. John's wort genus characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves. It is a perennial shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia, typically growing in woodland or shaded areas. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental value. The species is noted for its medicinal properties, though it contains phototoxic compounds that require careful handling."
