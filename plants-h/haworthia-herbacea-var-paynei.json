    "intro": "Haworthia herbacea var. paynei, commonly known as the Payne's Haworthia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or yellow markings. The leaves are often covered in a fine, powdery coating called farina, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale yellow during the spring or summer. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and ease of care, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
