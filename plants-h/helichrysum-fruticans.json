    "intro": "Helichrysum fruticans, commonly known as the honeycomb bush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and its striking, yellow-orange flowers that resemble honeycombs. The plant produces small, bract-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a textured appearance. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. The flowers are typically visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
