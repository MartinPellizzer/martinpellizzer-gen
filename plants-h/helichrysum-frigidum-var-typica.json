    "intro": "Helichrysum frigidum var. typica, commonly known as the alpine everlasting, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers that resemble tiny suns. The plant produces papery, dry bracts that persist after the flowers have faded, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with rocky or gravelly conditions."
