    "intro": "Hakea polybractea, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems and clusters of small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by distinctive, woody follicles containing seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal regions. Hakea polybractea is well adapted to drought and salt spray, making it a hardy species in arid environments."
