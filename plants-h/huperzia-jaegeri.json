    "intro": "Huperzia jaegeri, commonly known as the Jaeger's spikemoss, is a tropical fern ally native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its upright, grass-like appearance with small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporophytes produce spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in strobila. Huperzia jaegeri is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in controlled indoor conditions."
