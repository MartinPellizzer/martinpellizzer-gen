    "intro": "Hiraea longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed hiraea, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions of Asia and the Pacific. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a smooth margin and emit a subtle, spicy scent when crushed. The flowers, which are small and white, are arranged in clusters and attract various pollinators such as bees and flies. Hiraea longipes is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
