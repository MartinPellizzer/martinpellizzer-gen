    "intro": "Hydrocotyle verticillata var. tenella, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water pennywort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and slow-moving freshwater habitats. It features small, round, floating leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in diameter, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces tiny white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. It spreads through both vegetative growth and seeds, making it a common sight in ponds and marshes. Its rapid growth can sometimes lead to dense mats that affect water flow and light penetration."
