    "intro": "Habenaria brevicalcarata, commonly known as the short-spurred orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories where it can thrive in the dappled light conditions. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with multiple stems arising from a rhizome system. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and have a distinctive short spur, which is a characteristic feature of the genus Habenaria. The species is noted for its delicate appearance and is often found in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi that aid in nutrient uptake."
