    "intro": "Hieracium ciliatiflorum, commonly known as the ciliate-flowered hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped with soft hairs, and the flowers are yellow with a distinctive ciliate (frayed) edge on the petals. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
