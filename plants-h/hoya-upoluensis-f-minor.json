    "intro": "Hoya upoluensis f. minor, commonly known as the miniature wax plant, is a compact epiphytic species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features small, waxy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink, often blooming in summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its delicate appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
