    "intro": "Helianthium, commonly known as the golden groundsel, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their daisy-like flowers, which typically feature yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. Helianthium species are native to various regions of the Americas, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments. They often grow in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in horticulture for their ornamental value."
