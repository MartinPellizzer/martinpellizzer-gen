    "intro": "Heimia montana, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with smooth, reddish bark and lance-shaped leaves. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Heimia montana is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
