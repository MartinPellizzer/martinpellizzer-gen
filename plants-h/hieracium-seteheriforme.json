    "intro": "Hieracium seteheriforme, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in some areas."
