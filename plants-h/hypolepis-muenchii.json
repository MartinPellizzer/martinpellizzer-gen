    "intro": "Hypolepis muenchii, commonly known as the Muench's shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Hypolepis muenchii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
