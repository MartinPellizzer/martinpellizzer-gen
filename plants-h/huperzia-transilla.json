    "intro": "Huperzia transilla, commonly known as the Transilvanian huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen appearance with glossy, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of many ferns. It is native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky outcrops. Huperzia transilla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
