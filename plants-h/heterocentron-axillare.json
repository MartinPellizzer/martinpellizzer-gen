It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of clusters of small, showy flowers arranged in a helix-like pattern. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly hairy surface. The flowers are hermaphroditic, featuring both stamens and a pistil, which facilitates self-pollination."
