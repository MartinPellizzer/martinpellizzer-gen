    "intro": "Hirtzia escobarii, commonly known as the Escobarii hirtz, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are usually hairy, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Hirtzia escobarii is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
