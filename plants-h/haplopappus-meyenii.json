    "intro": "Haplopappus meyenii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Haplopappus meyenii is adapted to survive in sandy or rocky soils with minimal water availability."
