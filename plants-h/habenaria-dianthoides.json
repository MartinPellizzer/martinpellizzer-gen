    "intro": "Habenaria dianthoides, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and its distinctive inflorescence of pink or white flowers arranged in a loose, cascading cluster. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are often pollinated by bees and other insects, and it produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
