    "intro": "Hypericum connatum var. chlorifolium, commonly known as the greenleaf St. John's wort, is a variant of the St. John's wort species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often broader than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers with five petals, typical of the Hypericaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or woodland habitats. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
