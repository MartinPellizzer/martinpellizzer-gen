    "intro": "Hieracium solidagineum subsp. barbulatum, commonly known as the downy hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are hairy and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. This subspecies is distinguished by its dense, downy hairs on the stems and leaves, which give it its common name."
