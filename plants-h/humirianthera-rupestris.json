    "intro": "Humirianthera rupestris, commonly known as the rock lily, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or mountainous regions. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, with a distinct fragrance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is known for its ability to thrive in well-drained, nutrient-poor environments. Humirianthera rupestris is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
