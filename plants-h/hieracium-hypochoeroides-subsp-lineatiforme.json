    "intro": "Hieracium hypochoeroides subsp. lineatiforme, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and leafy rosettes. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, with a distinctive whitish or yellowish marginal stripe, and it produces yellow flowers in clusters. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
