    "intro": "Hieracium benzianum subsp. sciaphiloides, commonly known as the shade-loving hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its preference for low light conditions, it is often found in areas with dense vegetation or under the canopy of trees."
