    "intro": "Helianthemum chamaecistus subsp. barbatum, commonly known as the woolly rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, often in clusters at the ends of its branches. The plant has dense, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact size and drought tolerance."
