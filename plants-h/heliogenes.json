    "intro": "Heliogenes, commonly known as the sunflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its large, showy composite flower heads that typically face the sun, a trait known as heliotropism. The plant features a robust stem with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers consist of numerous small tubular florets surrounded by a ring of ray florets, which give it a distinctive appearance. Heliogenes species are native to various regions of the Americas and are widely cultivated for their ornamental value and oil production."
