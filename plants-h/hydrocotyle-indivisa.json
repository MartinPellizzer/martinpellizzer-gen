    "intro": "Hydrocotyle indivisa, commonly known as the creeping marshplant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in the Americas. It features a sprawling growth habit with rhizomatous stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist soil and water surfaces. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves that are often floating or partially submerged, adapting to its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with five petals and numerous stamens, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Hydrocotyle indivisa plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
