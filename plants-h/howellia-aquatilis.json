    "intro": "Howellia aquatilis, commonly known as the aquatic willow, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that often grow along the surface of water or in moist soil. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a smooth surface and a slightly hairy underside. Howellia aquatilis plays an important role in stabilizing shoreline sediments and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
