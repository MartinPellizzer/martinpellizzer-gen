    "intro": "Hechtia lepidophylla, commonly known as the \"Mexican snowflake,\" is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to Mexico. This perennial plant is characterized by its rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that form a water-holding cup at the center. The leaves are typically blue-green in color and have a waxy texture, which helps the plant store water in arid environments. It produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil."
