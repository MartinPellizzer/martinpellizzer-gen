    "intro": "Hebe guthrieana, commonly known as the Waitaha hebe, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, which bloom in spring and summer. Hebe guthrieana thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
