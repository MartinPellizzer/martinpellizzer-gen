It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its large, broad leaves and produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and riverbanks. The tree can grow quite tall, reaching heights of up to 30 meters, making it a significant component of its native ecosystems."
