    "intro": "Hippocratea urceolus f. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved hooded bellflower, is a unique variant of the species Hippocratea urceolus. It is characterized by its reduced leaf size compared to the typical form, with leaves that are narrow and lanceolate. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, often with a distinctive hooded appearance. It is a herbaceous perennial native to specific regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. This botanical variant is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its morphological distinctiveness and potential ornamental value."
