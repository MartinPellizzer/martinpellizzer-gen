    "intro": "Hypericum simplex, commonly known as the lesser St. John's wort, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Hypericum simplex is also valued for its medicinal properties, though it contains compounds that can interact with certain medications."
