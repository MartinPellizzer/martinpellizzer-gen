    "intro": "Hepetis albucifolia, commonly known as the white-leaf hepatica, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It features distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that are typically white or pale green, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white, usually blooming in early spring. Its foliage is covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, which helps protect it from frost and moisture loss. Hepetis albucifolia is often found in woodland habitats, thriving in partial shade and well-drained soil."
