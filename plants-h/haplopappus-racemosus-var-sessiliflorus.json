    "intro": "Haplopappus racemosus var. sessiliflorus, commonly known as the sessile-flowered globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered yellow flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture, and the stems are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spherical fruits known as pappus, which aid in wind dispersal of its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
