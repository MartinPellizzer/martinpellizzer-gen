    "intro": "Hieracium pseudoprotractum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of tubular and ray florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are narrow and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in dense clusters. It is a herbaceous plant that can spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it an aggressive colonizer in certain environments."
