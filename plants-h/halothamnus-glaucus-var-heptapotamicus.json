    "intro": "Halothamnus glaucus var. heptapotamicus, commonly known as the seven-leaf halothamnus, is a succulent shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its fleshy, gray-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its succulent structure allows it to thrive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
