    "intro": "Heracleum xiaojinense, commonly known as the Xiao Jin Giant Hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its large, compound leaves and showy umbellate flowers. It is native to China and is often found in moist, open habitats such as riverbanks and forest edges. The plant can grow up to several meters in height, with a thick, hairy stem that becomes more prominent as it matures. Its flowers, which appear in late summer, are typically white or greenish-white, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant contains furanocoumarins, which can cause photodermatitis in humans if the skin is exposed to sunlight after contact."
