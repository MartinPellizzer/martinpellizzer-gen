    "intro": "Hypericum perforatum subsp. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf St. John's wort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, broad, elliptical leaves with translucent dots that are visible when held up to light. The plant produces yellow flowers with five\u82b1\u74e3, which bloom in summer. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. This subspecies is similar to the common St. John's wort but is distinguished by its broader foliage and slightly different flowering habits."
