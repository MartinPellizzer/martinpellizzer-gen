It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, red, berry-like fruits called hips, which are rich in vitamin C. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained soil in full sun. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in herbal medicine."
