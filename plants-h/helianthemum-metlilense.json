It is a low-growing shrub with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of bright red, pink, or white flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in Mediterranean climates."
