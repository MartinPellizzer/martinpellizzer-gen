    "intro": "Heliotropium coriaceum, commonly known as rough heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often resembling those of the related heliotrope species. Its leaves are covered in a thick, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant is also known for its strong, sometimes unpleasant odor, which is more noticeable when the flowers are in bloom."
