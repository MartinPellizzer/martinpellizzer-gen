    "intro": "Hieracium murorum var. hemigypotes, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are basal, rough, and hairy, while its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
