    "intro": "Heliomeris longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf heliomeris, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Heliomeris longifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
