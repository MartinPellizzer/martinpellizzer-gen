    "intro": "Heterolaena leucodon, commonly known as the white-haired heterolaena, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom during the dry season. It thrives in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands, often growing in full sun. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in warmer climates."
