    "intro": "Hieracium irginianum, commonly known as the Irish ragwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are rough and hairy, with a distinctive yellowish-green color, and its flowers bloom in shades of yellow to orange. It is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
