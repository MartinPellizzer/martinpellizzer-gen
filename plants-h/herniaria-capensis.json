    "intro": "Herniaria capensis, commonly known as the Cape sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features small, fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs. The plant produces tiny white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Herniaria capensis is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
