It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and clusters of small, yellowish to reddish flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Hieracium eriophorum is often found in Europe and parts of Asia, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
