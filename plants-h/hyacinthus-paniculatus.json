    "intro": "Hyacinthus paniculatus, commonly known as the clustered hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It produces dense, fragrant clusters of violet-blue flowers in late spring. The plant features strap-like, grassy leaves and is closely related to the common hyacinth. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its strong scent and early blooming habit."
