    "intro": "Hieracium adriaticum subsp. caricinum, commonly known as the Adriatic hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellowish-green composite flowers and basal rosettes of leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as meadows, riverbanks, and wetlands. It has hairy stems and narrow, linear leaves that help it retain moisture in its often wet environment. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it can outcompete native flora and is sometimes considered a weed."
