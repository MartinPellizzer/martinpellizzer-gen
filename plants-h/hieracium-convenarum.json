    "intro": "Hieracium convenarum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. Hieracium convenarum is a perennial plant that spreads through rhizomes and is sometimes considered a weed due to its aggressive growth."
