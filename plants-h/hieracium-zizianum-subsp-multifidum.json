    "intro": "Hieracium zizianum subsp. multifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright stems and basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the broader H. zizianum species."
