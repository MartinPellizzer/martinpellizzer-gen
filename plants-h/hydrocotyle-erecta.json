    "intro": "Hydrocotyle erecta, commonly known as the upright water pennywort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged, with a dense network of veins. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels, typically appearing in late summer. Hydrocotyle erecta plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
