    "intro": "Huperzia subintegra, commonly known as the mountain huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and distinctive, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, rounded cushions on the underside of the fronds. Huperzia subintegra is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
