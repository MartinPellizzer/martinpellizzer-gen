    "intro": "Hieracium lachenalii subsp. macrophyllopodum, commonly known as the large-leaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often in nutrient-rich soils. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
