    "intro": "Hymenolobium stipulatum, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and produces small yellow flowers in clusters. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its seeds are encased in pods and are often used in traditional medicine. The yellow acacia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
