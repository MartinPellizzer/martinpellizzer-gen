    "intro": "Hopea enicosanthoides, commonly known as the Bornean ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark timber that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has large, elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface and a pale underside, and it produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in panicles. Its fruits are woody capsules that contain several winged seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. Due to its ecological importance and economic value, Hopea enicosanthoides is often found in lowland dipterocarp forests."
