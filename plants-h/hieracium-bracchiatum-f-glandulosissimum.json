    "intro": "Hieracium bracchiatum f. glandulosissimum, commonly known as the glandular hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and stems, which give it its specific epithet \"glandulosissimum.\" The plant produces yellow composite flowers, typical of the Asteraceae family, arranged in a head made up of many small florets. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, thriving in temperate regions. This variant is noted for its distinctive glandular structures, which may play a role in its ecological interactions and chemical defenses."
