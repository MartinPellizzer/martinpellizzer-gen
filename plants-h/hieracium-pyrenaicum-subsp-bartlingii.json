    "intro": "Hieracium pyrenaicum subsp. bartlingii, commonly known as the Pyrenean hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow flowering heads. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, and it is often found in open, sunny environments. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
