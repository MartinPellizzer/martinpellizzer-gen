    "intro": "Helianthemum fumana subsp. ericoides, commonly known as the Ericoid Heath Helianthemum, is a low-growing shrub native to the western Mediterranean region. It typically features dense, compact foliage with small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically borne on short, hairy pedicels. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. This subspecies is often found in heathlands and open woodlands, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
