It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, yellowish to reddish-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its flowering period occurs from late spring to early autumn. Hieracium exsulans is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, where it can become invasive in certain habitats."
