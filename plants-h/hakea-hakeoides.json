    "intro": "Hakea hakeoides, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves and its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Hakea hakeoides is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
