It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers that remain intact for a long time after blooming. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in sunny conditions."
