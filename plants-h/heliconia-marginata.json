    "intro": "Heliconia marginata, commonly known as the red heliconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright red bracts that enclose its small, yellow flowers. The plant belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its inflorescence, known as a spadix, is surrounded by long, strap-like bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. Heliconia marginata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or near water sources."
