It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, dissected leaves that give it a fern-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the daisy family. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. This variety is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it is considered a common weed in many regions."
