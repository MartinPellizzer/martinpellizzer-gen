These plants are native to South America, particularly the Andean regions of Peru and Ecuador. Hanslia species are typically herbaceous, with striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in the spring. They often grow in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. The genus is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and tubular flowers that attract pollinators like hummingbirds."
