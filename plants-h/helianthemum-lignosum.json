    "intro": "Helianthemum lignosum, commonly known as the everlastings or rock rose, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding vibrant color to rocky or sandy soils. The plant has a woody base and is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as coastal cliffs and limestone areas. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss. Helianthemum lignosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
