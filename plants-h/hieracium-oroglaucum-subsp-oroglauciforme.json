    "intro": "Hieracium oroglaucum subsp. oroglauciforme, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow ray florets surrounded by a dense cluster of disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes. It has a hairy stem and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This subspecies is adapted to cold, harsh environments and is often found in mountainous areas."
