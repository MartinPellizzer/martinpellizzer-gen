    "intro": "Heteropterys martiana f. eglandulosa, commonly known as the glandular heteropterys, is a botanical variant of the species Heteropterys martiana. It is characterized by its glandular structures on the leaves and stems, which may play a role in defense against herbivores or in water retention. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The flowering and fruiting characteristics of this form are similar to the species, though it may exhibit slight variations in morphology."
