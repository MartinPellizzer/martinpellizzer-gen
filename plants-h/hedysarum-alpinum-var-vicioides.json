    "intro": "Hedysarum alpinum var. vicioides, commonly known as the alpine vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces slender, serpentine pods containing small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Hedysarum alpinum var. vicioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
