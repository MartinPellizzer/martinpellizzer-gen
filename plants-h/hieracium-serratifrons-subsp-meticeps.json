    "intro": "Hieracium serratifrons subsp. meticeps, commonly known as the serrated hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and ray florets. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are serrated and often have a hairy texture, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. The subspecies meticeps is distinguished by its elongated, upward-curving sepals and slightly different leaf morphology compared to other subspecies of Hieracium serratifrons."
