    "intro": "Herpestis pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf sandwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to sandy and gravelly soils in the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with slender, branching stems covered in small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Herpestis pygmaea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions."
