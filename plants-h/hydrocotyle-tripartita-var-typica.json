    "intro": "Hydrocotyle tripartita var. typica, commonly known as the three-lobed water shield, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features floating leaves that are typically divided into three distinct lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom from late summer to early autumn. Its roots are anchored in the mud, and it spreads through both vegetative growth and seed dispersal. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
