It is a small shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 meter, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. These flowers are often followed by spherical, greenish fruits that turn red when ripe.
