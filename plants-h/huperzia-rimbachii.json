    "intro": "Huperzia rimbachii, commonly known as the Rimbach's clubmoss, is a species of evergreen fern ally native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant features needle-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. Huperzia rimbachii is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophylls, are clustered at the tips of the stems and produce spores for propagation."
