    "intro": "Hieracium laevigatum subsp. sinuatum, commonly known as the smooth hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native plant species."
