    "intro": "Helichrysum dubium, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that are often dried and used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. Its foliage is typically silver-gray, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Helichrysum dubium thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
