    "intro": "Hieracium beamanii, commonly known as Beaman's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It produces yellow flowers with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, and its leaves are usually hairy and alternate along the stem. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Beaman's hawkweed is considered a rare and endangered species."
