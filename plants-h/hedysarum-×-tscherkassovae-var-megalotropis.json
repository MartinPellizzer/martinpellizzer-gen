    "intro": "Hedysarum \u00d7 tscherkassovae var. megalotropis, commonly known as the large-flowered peavine, is a hybrid perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its robust stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, making it resilient in harsh environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its beauty."
