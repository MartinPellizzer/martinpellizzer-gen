    "intro": "Heliocereus speciosissimus, commonly known as the sun cactus, is a species of epiphytic cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems that bear clusters of large, showy flowers that open at night. The flowers are typically pale yellow to white with a reddish or pinkish tinge, and they emit a strong, sweet fragrance. This plant thrives in warm, sunny environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
