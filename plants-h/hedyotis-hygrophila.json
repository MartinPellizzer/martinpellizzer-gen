    "intro": "Hedyotis hygrophila, commonly known as the water pennywort, is a small herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Hedyotis hygrophila thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in temperate regions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
