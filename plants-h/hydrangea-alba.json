    "intro": "Hydrangea alba, commonly known as the white hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy clusters of white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces both sterile and fertile flowers, with the sterile ones contributing to the plant's ornamental value. Its leaves are typically large, ovate, and have a serrated edge. Hydrangea alba thrives in partial shade and requires moist, well-drained soil for optimal growth."
