    "intro": "Hedysarum pulchellum, commonly known as the showy milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial herb with slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Hedysarum pulchellum is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it a valuable plant for erosion control in arid environments."
