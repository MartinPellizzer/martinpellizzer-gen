    "intro": "Humboltia discoidea, commonly known as the desert thornapple, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its spiny stems and showy, violet to purple flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Humboltia discoidea is adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions, with deep root systems and thick, waxy leaves to reduce water loss. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
