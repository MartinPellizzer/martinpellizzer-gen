    "intro": "Heisteria pubescens, commonly known as the woolly heister, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, or pubescent, stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Heisteria pubescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
