    "intro": "Hemionitis peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian water fern, is a unique aquatic plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that often appear in clusters. The plant has a distinct morphology with four to six leaflets arranged in a cross shape, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and wetlands. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Hemionitis peruviana is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality."
