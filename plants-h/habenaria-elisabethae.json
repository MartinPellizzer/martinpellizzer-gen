    "intro": "Habenaria elisabethae, commonly known as the Elizabeth's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its tropical habitat. Its leaves are usually broad and elliptical, adapted to capture sunlight efficiently in its natural environment. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
