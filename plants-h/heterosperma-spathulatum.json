    "intro": "Heterosperma spathulatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved water plant, is a flowering plant species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Commelinaceae and is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that often float on the water surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in shallow water environments and is often found in ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. Its rapid growth makes it both a useful aquatic plant and a potential invasive species in some regions."
