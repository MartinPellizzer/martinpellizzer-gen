    "intro": "Helictotrichon dahuricum, commonly known as Siberian grass or Siberian wheatgrass, is a flowering plant native to the cold climates of Asia. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in open, dry, and often rocky habitats. The plant has slender, upright stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue or purple flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Helictotrichon dahuricum is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid environments."
