    "intro": "Hylomecon vernalis f. albilutescens, commonly known as the white-flowered hylomecon, is a rare and delicate perennial herb belonging to the Papaveraceae family. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
