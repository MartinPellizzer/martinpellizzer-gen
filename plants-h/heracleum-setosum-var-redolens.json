    "intro": "Heracleum setosum var. redolens, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, umbrella-shaped white flowers and thick, hairy stems that can grow up to 5 meters in height. The plant has large, deeply lobed leaves that are covered in fine, irritating hairs. It is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is more pronounced in the varietal form redolens. Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a noxious weed and can cause severe skin irritation."
