    "intro": "Hetaeria cristata var. tokioi, commonly known as the Tokyo hetaeria, is a rare and striking orchid native to Japan. It is characterized by its unique, flattened, and often brightly colored petals that resemble a crown, giving it its species name \"cristata.\" The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as mountain forests, where it thrives in the dappled light of the understory. Its flowers are usually small but numerous, arranged in dense clusters that add to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicately endangered species."
