    "intro": "Horsfieldia polyspherula var. polyspherula, commonly known as the purple orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which are typically clustered in inflorescences. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. The orchid's unique floral structure and vibrant coloration make it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation."
