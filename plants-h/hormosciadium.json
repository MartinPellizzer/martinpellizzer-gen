    "intro": "Hormosciadium, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a flowering head that resembles a dandelion, though it is not closely related. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and is found in various parts of Africa and the Mediterranean. Its flowers are usually yellow and bloom in the spring, producing small, wind-dispersed seeds. Hormosciadium species are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
