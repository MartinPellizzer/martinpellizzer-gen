    "intro": "Humata archboldii, commonly known as the Archbold's humata, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its foliage consists of small, opposite leaves with a smooth texture and a distinct aromatic scent. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Humata archboldii is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and invasive species."
