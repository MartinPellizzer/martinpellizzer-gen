    "intro": "Hyparrhenia effusa, commonly known as the African grass or tufted grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a compact rosette. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Hyparrhenia effusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and ability to withstand drought conditions."
