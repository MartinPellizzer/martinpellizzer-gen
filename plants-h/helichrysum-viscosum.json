    "intro": "Helichrysum viscosum, commonly known as sticky helichrysum, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, sticky leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. The sticky resin on its leaves serves as a natural defense against herbivores and pests."
