    "intro": "Hottonia littoralis, commonly known as the water bellflower, is a aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving rivers. The plant has long, slender stems that float on the water surface, with small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, adapted for efficient light absorption in aquatic environments. H. littoralis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl."
