It is characterized by its long, hanging inflorescences that resemble a beard, hence its common name. The plant features yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a rough texture. It is native to Europe and thrives in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas. The subspecies senile is distinguished by its more elongated and drooping flower heads compared to other subspecies."
