    "intro": "Hemionitis candida, commonly known as the white horse fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, silky hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in shaded forest areas. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Hemionitis candida is considered endangered in its natural range."
