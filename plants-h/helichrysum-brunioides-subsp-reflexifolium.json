    "intro": "Helichrysum brunioides subsp. reflexifolium, commonly known as the reflexed helichrysum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, golden-yellow flowers that resemble daisies. The leaves are typically narrow and reflexed, meaning they curve backward, giving the plant its subspecies name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in traditional herbal medicine."
