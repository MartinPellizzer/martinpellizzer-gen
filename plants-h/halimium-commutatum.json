    "intro": "Halimium commutatum, commonly known as the rock rose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender stems. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Halimium commutatum is well adapted to Mediterranean climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
