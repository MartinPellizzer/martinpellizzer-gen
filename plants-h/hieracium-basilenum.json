    "intro": "Hieracium basilenum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Hieracium basilenum is an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production."
