    "intro": "Hakea invaginata var. pachycarpa, commonly known as the broad-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems and thick, leathery leaves that are often arranged in a spiral. The plant produces bright red, urn-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and adaptability to dry conditions make it suitable for coastal and sandy soils. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
