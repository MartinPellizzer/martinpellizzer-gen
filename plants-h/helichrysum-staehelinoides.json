    "intro": "Helichrysum staehelinoides, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its clusters of small, golden-yellow flower heads that remain intact even after flowering. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Its flowers are typically arranged in spherical or cylindrical inflorescences, and it is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms. Helichrysum staehelinoides thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
