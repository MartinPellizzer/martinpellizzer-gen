    "intro": "Hosta caerulea f. latemarginata, commonly known as the Blue Magic Hosta, is a cultivar prized for its striking foliage. It features broad, waxy leaves that are predominantly blue-green in color with a wide, pale yellow margin. The plant is native to the humid woodlands of eastern Asia and thrives in partial to full shade. It produces small, fragrant white flowers in late summer, though the foliage is the main ornamental feature. This variety is relatively low maintenance and suitable for moist, well-drained soil in garden settings."
