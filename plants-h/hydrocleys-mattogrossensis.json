    "intro": "Hydrocleys mattogrossensis, commonly known as the Brazilian water shield, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America. It has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with a spongy underside that helps it remain buoyant. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, typically in late summer. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as lakes and ponds. Its unique structure allows it to play a role in water filtration and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
