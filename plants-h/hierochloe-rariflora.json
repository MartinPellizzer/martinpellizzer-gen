    "intro": "Hierochloe rariflora, commonly known as the rare feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It features slender, wiry stems and fine, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Hierochloe rariflora thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical and ecological studies."
