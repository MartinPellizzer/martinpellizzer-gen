    "intro": "Hoya bakoensis, commonly known as the Bako Hoya, is a tropical vine native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its waxy, ovate leaves and clusters of star-shaped, fragrant flowers. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Hoya bakoensis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
