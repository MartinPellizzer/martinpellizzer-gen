    "intro": "Humata brackenridgei, commonly known as the Brackenridge's humata, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in its native range."
