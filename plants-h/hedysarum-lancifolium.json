    "intro": "Hedysarum lancifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are trifoliate with lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its pods are elongated and contain several seeds, and it is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Hedysarum lancifolium plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it valuable for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
