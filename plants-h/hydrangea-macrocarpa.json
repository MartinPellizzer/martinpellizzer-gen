    "intro": "Hydrangea macrocarpa, commonly known as the smooth hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, showy clusters of white or pink flowers that change color based on soil pH. The plant produces large, broad leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. The hydrangea macrocarpa is also notable for its ability to produce fruit, which contains seeds dispersed by birds."
