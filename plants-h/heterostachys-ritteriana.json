It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized root structures called haustoria. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid forest environments. Its ecological role includes providing food for certain bird species that consume its berries."
