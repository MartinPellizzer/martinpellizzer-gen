It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and yellow flower heads composed of numerous tiny florets. Native to Europe, it thrives in moist, grassy habitats and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread. Its botanical features make it a common weed in cultivated areas and a subject of ecological study."
