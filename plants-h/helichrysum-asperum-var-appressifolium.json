    "intro": "Helichrysum asperum var. appressifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved everlasting, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are narrow, leathery, and often covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
