    "intro": "Hedysarum stipulaceum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sweet clover, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features compound leaves with stipules, which are small, leaf-like structures at the base of each leaflet. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Hedysarum stipulaceum is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
