    "intro": "Hieracium valdepilosum var. ramosissimum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy, often reddish stems and basal rosettes of leaves. The plant produces yellow flower heads that consist of numerous small florets, typical of the dandelion-like composite flowers in the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and habitat diversity."
