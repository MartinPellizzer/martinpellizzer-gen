    "intro": "Haemodorum sparsiflorum, commonly known as the sparseflower hellbender, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the wet tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically red or orange in color, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing along the edges of waterways. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in its native range."
