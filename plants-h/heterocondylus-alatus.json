    "intro": "Heterocondylus alatus, commonly known as the winged fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that have a leathery texture and are adorned with small, wing-like structures along the edges. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky areas, where it can thrive in the presence of high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal. Heterocondylus alatus is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
