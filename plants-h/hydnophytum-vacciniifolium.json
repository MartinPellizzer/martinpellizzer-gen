It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its striking red flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant is often found growing in moist, shaded environments such as forests and swampy areas. Its unique morphology includes a short, woody stem and showy bracts that surround the flowers. Hydnophytum vacciniifolium is also notable for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with certain fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption."
