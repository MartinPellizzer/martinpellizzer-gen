    "intro": "Homeria lilacina, commonly known as the pink sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a rough texture, while its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Homeria lilacina is considered a rare and endangered species."
