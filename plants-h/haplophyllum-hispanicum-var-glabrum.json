    "intro": "Haplophyllum hispanicum var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth haplophyllum, is a rare and specialized plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, simple leaves and clustered flowers. The plant is typically found in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in dry, sunny environments. Its glabrous (smooth) leaves distinguish it from other varieties within the species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
