    "intro": "Hieracium cauri, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in a flat-topped cluster. The plant has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It is an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production."
