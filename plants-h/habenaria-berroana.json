    "intro": "Habenaria berroana, commonly known as the Berroan orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its elegant, lance-shaped leaves and its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are often arranged in a loose inflorescence and are pollinated by specific insect species. This orchid is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
