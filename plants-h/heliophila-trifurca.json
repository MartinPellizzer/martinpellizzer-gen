    "intro": "Heliophila trifurca, commonly known as the three-branch heliophyte, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, thriving in sunny conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Heliophila trifurca is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic insect populations."
