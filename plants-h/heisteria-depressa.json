    "intro": "Heisteria depressa, commonly known as the creeping heister, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, known as farina. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to humid, temperate climates."
