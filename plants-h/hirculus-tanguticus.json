    "intro": "Hirculus tanguticus, commonly known as the Tangut goat's horn plant, is a rare and enigmatic species native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and sometimes edible or medicinal properties. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are inconspicuous, typically greenish in color, and are arranged in clusters at the base of the plant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hirculus tanguticus is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
