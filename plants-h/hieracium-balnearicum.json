    "intro": "Hieracium balnearicum, commonly known as the seaside hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. It is adapted to salt-laden winds and can tolerate moderate levels of coastal salinity. Its growth habit and floral structure make it a distinctive member of the Asteraceae family."
