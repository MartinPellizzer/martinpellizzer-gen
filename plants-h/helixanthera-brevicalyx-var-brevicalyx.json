    "intro": "Helixanthera brevicalyx var. brevicalyx, commonly known as the small-flowered helixanthera, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and its roots are fibrous, aiding in its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in shaded, humid environments such as forest understories or along riverbanks. The flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological role in supporting local pollinator populations."
