It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the leaves are rough and hairy. Hieracium oletatum is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
