    "intro": "Heracleum canariense, commonly known as the Canary giant hogweed, is a tall herbaceous plant native to the Canary Islands. It features large, umbrella-like compound leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in late summer, which are arranged in an inflorescence resembling a compound umbel. Its stem is thick, hollow, and covered with coarse hairs, and it can grow up to 4 meters in height. It is considered invasive in some regions and can pose a risk due to its phototoxic sap."
