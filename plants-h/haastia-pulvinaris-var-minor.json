    "intro": "Haastia pulvinaris var. minor, commonly known as the small Haast's grass, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family native to New Zealand. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant characterized by its dense rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The leaves are typically a vibrant green and possess a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. It produces striking, spadix-like inflorescences that are often pink or red in color. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
