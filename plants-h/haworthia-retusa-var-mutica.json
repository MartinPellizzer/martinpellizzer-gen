    "intro": "Haworthia retusa var. mutica, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves with distinctive white or yellow markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The leaves are typically bluish-green in color and have a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers on tall, slender stems during the growing season. This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
