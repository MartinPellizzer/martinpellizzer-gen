    "intro": "Hieracium nigrescenticeps, commonly known as the blackening-headed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosette of leaves, which are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces yellow ray florets surrounded by a dense cluster of tubular disc florets, forming composite flower heads. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its common name refers to the darkening of the flower head as it matures, a distinctive botanical feature."
