    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved cow parsnip, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a tall, hollow stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a distinctive purple tint. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are narrow and arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in umbrella-like inflorescences called umbels. The plant is known for its strong, sometimes irritating odor and is often found in moist meadows and along riverbanks."
