    "intro": "Heliophytum erosum, commonly known as the desert rose or rock rose, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its fleshy, water-storing stems and thick, leathery leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, often blooming in spring. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soil conditions and high temperatures. Heliophytum erosum is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
