    "intro": "Haageocereus bieblii subsp. bieblii, commonly known as the Bieblii cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a low-growing, columnar cactus with a ribbed stem and spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the base of the stems. It is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its slow growth rate makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
