    "intro": "Hieracium cynoglossoides, commonly known as the broadleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with basal leaves that are broadly ovate and hairy. Its yellow flowers bloom in summer, and the plant is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
