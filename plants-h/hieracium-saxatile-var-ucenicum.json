    "intro": "Hieracium saxatile var. ucenicum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows in rocky, alpine, and subalpine habitats, often on slopes and cliffs. The plant features a compact rosette of basal leaves that are covered in dense, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It produces yellow flowers in a single inflorescence at the end of the stem, which bloom from late spring to early summer. This variant is distinguished by its smaller stature and more compact growth compared to other members of the Hieracium genus."
