    "intro": "Horsfieldia palauensis, commonly known as the Palau orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the island of Palau in the Western Pacific. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the humid environment. Horsfieldia palauensis is an important component of the local flora and is often found in lowland and hill forest ecosystems."
