It features short, thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with distinctive white or pale markings. The plant produces tall, slender flower stalks that bear small, white or pale yellow flowers. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and requiring minimal watering. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and rockeries."
