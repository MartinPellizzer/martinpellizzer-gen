    "intro": "Hertrichocereus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a genus of cacti native to the Americas. These plants are characterized by their spiny stems and their ability to bloom at night, producing large, fragrant flowers. The genus includes several species, such as Hertrichocereus mirabilis, which is known for its showy, white flowers. They are adapted to arid environments and store water in their thick, fleshy stems. The flowers typically open in the evening and close by dawn, a trait that aids in pollination by nocturnal insects."
