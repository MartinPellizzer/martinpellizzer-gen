    "intro": "Hydrocotyle bowlesioides, commonly known as the Madagascar water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Madagascar. It features small, floating leaves that are typically heart-shaped with a waxy surface. The plant produces tiny white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the wet season. Its rhizomes spread along the water's surface, forming dense mats that can help stabilize aquatic ecosystems. Hydrocotyle bowlesioides is adapted to slow-moving or still freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes."
