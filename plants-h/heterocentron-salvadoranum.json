It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy white flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots anchor it to the substrate, while its leaves provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. The flowers emit a mild fragrance, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
