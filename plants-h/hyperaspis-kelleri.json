    "intro": "Hyperaspis kelleri, commonly known as the Keller's flatback weevil, is a species of beetle belonging to the family Curculionidae. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped body and a distinctive flattened back, which gives it its common name. The plant associated with this species is not a true plant but rather a host plant for its larvae, typically certain species of flowering plants. Hyperaspis kelleri is primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it feeds on the leaves of its host plants. Due to its specific ecological niche, it plays a role in the natural pest control of its host plants in its habitat."
