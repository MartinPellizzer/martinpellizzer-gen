It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. The plants typically have simple, opposite leaves and produce showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. They are often found in moist, shaded environments and are characterized by their fibrous, woody stems. The genus is notable for its ecological importance in supporting local wildlife and its potential use in traditional medicine."
