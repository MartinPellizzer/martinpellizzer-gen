    "intro": "Heliomeris annua, commonly known as the annual heliomeris, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Heliomeris annua is adapted to hot, dry climates and has a short growing season, often blooming in late summer or early autumn. Its succulent-like leaves and stems help it retain moisture in harsh environments."
