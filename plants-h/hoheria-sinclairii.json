    "intro": "Hoheria sinclairii, commonly known as the sinclair's bottle tree, is a distinctive shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its thick, bottle-shaped stems that store water, adapting to its arid and coastal environments. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, providing a drought-resistant feature. Hoheria sinclairii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
