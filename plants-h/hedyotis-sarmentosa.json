It features small, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of white or yellow flowers. The plant has a trailing growth habit and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its stems are wiry and can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread easily. Hedyotis sarmentosa is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
