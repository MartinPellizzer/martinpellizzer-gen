    "intro": "Helonias nigra, commonly known as the blackroot fern, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, thriving in moist, acidic soils. The plant has a rhizomatous root system and produces tall, slender stems that bear small, dark green leaves. Its flowers are clustered in spike-like inflorescences and are often hidden beneath the leaves. Helonias nigra is notable for its ability to tolerate and even improve soil conditions in nutrient-poor environments."
