    "intro": "Hypericum arbuscula, commonly known as the dwarf St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the southern United States. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves and produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Hypericum arbuscula is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
