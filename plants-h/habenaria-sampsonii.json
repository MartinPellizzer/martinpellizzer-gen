    "intro": "Habenaria sampsonii, commonly known as the Sampson's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in seasonal habitats. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The species is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
