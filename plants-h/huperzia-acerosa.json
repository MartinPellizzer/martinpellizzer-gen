    "intro": "Huperzia acerosa, commonly known as the hard-leaved huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its robust, leathery, and often spiny leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette or clustered formation. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are borne on the underside of the leaves, a feature common in many ferns. Huperzia acerosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops."
