    "intro": "Hedysarum recurvatum, commonly known as the curlleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in dry, rocky soils. It is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Hedysarum recurvatum plays a role in soil stabilization and is used in restoration projects due to its hardiness."
