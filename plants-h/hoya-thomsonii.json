    "intro": "Hoya thomsonii, commonly known as the \"Wax Plant\" or \"Porcelain Flower,\" is a species of flowering plant in the family Asclepiadaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of star-shaped, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. Hoya thomsonii is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded environments. It is popular among houseplant enthusiasts due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light."
