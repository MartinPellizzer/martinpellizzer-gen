    "intro": "Hypechusa lutea var. amphiantha, commonly known as the yellow false nettle, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettles and related species. The plant is characterized by its slender stems, opposite leaves with serrated edges, and small yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The species is often mistaken for true nettles due to its similar appearance, but it lacks the stinging hairs found on most Urticaceae plants."
