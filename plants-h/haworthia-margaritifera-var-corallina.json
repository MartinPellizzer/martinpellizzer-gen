    "intro": "Haworthia margaritifera var. corallina, commonly known as the coral haworthia, is a compact, leafy succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or pink markings, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern and often have a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, white or pale green flowers on tall, slender stems during the warmer months. This variety is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and unique aesthetic."
