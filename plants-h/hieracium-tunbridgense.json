    "intro": "Hieracium tunbridgense, commonly known as the Tunbridge Wells hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the United Kingdom. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of tubular and ray florets. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. It produces yellow flowers from June to August, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in parts of its native range."
