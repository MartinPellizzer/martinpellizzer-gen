    "intro": "Heliabravoa chende, commonly known as the golden sunflower of the Andes, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and specialized structures called phyllaries. The plant produces bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, aiding in water retention in arid environments. Heliabravoa chende is adapted to thrive in cool, sunny conditions with well-drained soil."
