    "intro": "Hydrocotyle glabrata, commonly known as water pennywort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow water, such as ponds, streams, and ditches, and has floating or submerged leaves that are usually heart-shaped or rounded. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it is often found in still or slow-moving water bodies. Hydrocotyle glabrata is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and its ability to spread through both vegetative reproduction and seeds. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
