    "intro": "Heliotropium carduchorum, commonly known as the desert heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial species characterized by its small, often hairy leaves and clusters of pink or purple flowers. The plant exhibits heliotropic behavior, meaning its flowers turn toward the sun during the day. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Heliotropium carduchorum is often found in disturbed habitats and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
