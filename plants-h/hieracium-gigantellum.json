    "intro": "Hieracium gigantellum, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are typically hairy and have a rough texture. It spreads primarily through rhizomes and can form dense colonies, often invading grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its rapid growth and invasive nature, it is considered a problematic weed in many regions."
