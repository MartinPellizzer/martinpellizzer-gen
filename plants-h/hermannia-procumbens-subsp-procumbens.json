    "intro": "Hermannia procumbens subsp. procumbens, commonly known as the creeping hermannia, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a sprawling habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers, typically in shades of red or pink, which bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptical, and often covered with fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
