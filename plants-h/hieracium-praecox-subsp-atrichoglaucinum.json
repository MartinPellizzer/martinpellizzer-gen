    "intro": "Hieracium praecox subsp. atrichoglaucinum, commonly known as the glaucous hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, yellowish-green leaves and small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its subspecies is distinguished by its glaucous (bluish-green) appearance and the absence of leaf hairs, which sets it apart from other hawkweed species. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
