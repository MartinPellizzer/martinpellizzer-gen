    "intro": "Hedyotis asperifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf dotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, rough hairs, giving it its common name. Its small, white or yellowish flowers are clustered in dense racemes, and it produces small, three-lobed berries. Hedyotis asperifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
