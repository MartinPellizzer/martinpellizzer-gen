    "intro": "Hedera hibernica var. maculata, commonly known as the spotted ivy, is a variant of the common ivy characterized by its distinctive variegated foliage. Its leaves are typically a mix of green and white or cream, creating a striking visual contrast. This plant is a climbing species that can grow on walls, trees, or trellises, often forming dense mats. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is relatively low maintenance. The variegation is due to genetic mutations that affect chlorophyll production in certain leaf areas."
