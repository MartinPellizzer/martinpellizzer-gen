    "intro": "Hieracium staticifolium, commonly known as the water cinquefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are usually basal, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss, and its flowers are yellow with ray florets. The species is noted for its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
