    "intro": "Hieracium pallidum subsp. diversifolium, commonly known as the pale hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are usually lanceolate to ovate, varying in shape and size across individuals, which contributes to its subspecies designation. It produces yellowish to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer."
