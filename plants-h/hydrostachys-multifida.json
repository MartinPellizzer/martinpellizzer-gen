    "intro": "Hydrostachys multifida, commonly known as the African waterwheel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that give it a wheel-like appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in wet or marshy environments and is often found near water bodies. Hydrostachys multifida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
