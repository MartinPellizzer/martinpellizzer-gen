    "intro": "Hieracium cyrtocladum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, white to grayish pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Hieracium cyrtocladum is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and other flowering plants with composite flower heads."
