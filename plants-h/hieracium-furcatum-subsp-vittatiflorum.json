    "intro": "Hieracium furcatum subsp. vittatiflorum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads made up of many small florets. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is typically found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is sometimes grown in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
