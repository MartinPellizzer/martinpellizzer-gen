    "intro": "Hibiscus erianthus, commonly known as the velvetleaf hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep pink, often with a prominent yellow or orange center. Hibiscus erianthus is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
