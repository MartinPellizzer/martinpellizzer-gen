    "intro": "Helianthocereus poco var. fricianus, commonly known as the Frician night-blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems and spiny, ribbed structure, typical of many cacti in the Cactaceae family. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. The flowers are ephemeral, lasting only a single night, which is a distinctive botanical feature of this species."
