    "intro": "Humblotiangraecum potamophilum, commonly known as the riverbank beauty, is a rare flowering plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils along riverbanks and swampy areas. The plant produces striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
