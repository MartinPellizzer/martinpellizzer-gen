    "intro": "Hierochloe mexicana, commonly known as Mexican hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small wildlife. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities in its geographic range."
