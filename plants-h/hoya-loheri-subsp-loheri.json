It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, often blooming during the summer months. It is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light.
