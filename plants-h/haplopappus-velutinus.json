It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, linear leaves covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance.

Haplopappus velutinus thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
