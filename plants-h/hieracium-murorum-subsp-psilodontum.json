    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. psilodontum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
