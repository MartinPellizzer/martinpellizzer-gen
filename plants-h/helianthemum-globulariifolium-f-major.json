It features dense, compact growth with fleshy, rounded leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces showy, bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Its drought tolerance makes it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
