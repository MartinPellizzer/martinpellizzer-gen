    "intro": "Hakea insignis, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems and its distinctive, urn-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant produces woody, cone-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Hakea insignis is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
