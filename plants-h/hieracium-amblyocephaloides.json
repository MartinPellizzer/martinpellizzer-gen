    "intro": "Hieracium amblyocephaloides, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a cluster of small flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It has rough, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
