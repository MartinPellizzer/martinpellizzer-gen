    "intro": "Hyrtanandra ternata, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, dark brown bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by dark blue, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open woodlands. Due to its slow growth and limited natural range, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
