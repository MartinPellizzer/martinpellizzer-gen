    "intro": "Hufelandia anay, commonly known as the sacred mountain plant, is a rare flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers and dark green, waxy leaves. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and requires well-drained soil to thrive. Its growth is slow, and it often blooms only once every few years, making it a prized specimen among botanists and collectors. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hufelandia anay is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
