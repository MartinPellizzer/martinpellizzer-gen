    "intro": "Halophila ovalis var. ovata, commonly known as the common sea horse grass, is a marine flowering plant belonging to the Alismataceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. This species thrives in shallow, tropical coastal waters, often forming dense underwater meadows. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, anchoring it to the seafloor and facilitating vegetative propagation. Halophila ovalis var. ovata plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and shelter for various marine organisms."
