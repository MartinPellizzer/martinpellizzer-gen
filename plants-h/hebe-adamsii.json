    "intro": "Hebe adamsii, commonly known as the Adams' hebe, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces spikes of tubular flowers, typically in shades of blue, purple, or white, which bloom in spring and summer. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, providing year-round interest in gardens. Hebe adamsii is well-suited to coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and well-drained soils."
