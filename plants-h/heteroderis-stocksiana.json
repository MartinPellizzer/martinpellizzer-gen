    "intro": "Heteroderis stocksiana, commonly known as the New Zealand burrseed, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and its ability to thrive in rocky and coastal environments. Its seeds are encased in a hard, burred husk, which helps in seed dispersal. Heteroderis stocksiana is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its native habitat."
