    "intro": "Haplopappus compactus, commonly known as the sticky goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typically herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine, sticky coating, which helps in reducing water loss. Haplopappus compactus is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
