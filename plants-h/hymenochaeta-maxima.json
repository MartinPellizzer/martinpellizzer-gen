It has a distinctive bracket shape with a thick, spongy cap and a tough, fibrous underside. The fungus is characterized by its pale to yellowish color and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. It plays an important ecological role in decomposing wood and recycling nutrients in forest ecosystems. Hymenochaeta maxima is a perennial species that can live for many years on its host tree."
