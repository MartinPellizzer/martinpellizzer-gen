    "intro": "Helianthemum maritimum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of southern Europe. It features silver-gray foliage with a dense, woolly texture, and its flowers are typically yellow or orange, resembling small sunflowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is highly drought-tolerant. It has small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss, and its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Helianthemum maritimum is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
