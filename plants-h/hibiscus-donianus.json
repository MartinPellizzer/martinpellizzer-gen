    "intro": "Hibiscus donianus, commonly known as the African sandalwood or donian's hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, featuring thick, woody stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which bloom in the morning and close by afternoon. Hibiscus donianus is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Its flowers are also used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
