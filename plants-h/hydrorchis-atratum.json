    "intro": "Hydrorchis atratum, commonly known as the black orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dark purple to blackish flowers, which are often adorned with intricate white or pale markings. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or along rocky outcrops. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
