    "intro": "Hieracium dasycraspedum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features dense, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, grassy areas and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
