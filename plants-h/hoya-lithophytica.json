    "intro": "Hoya lithophytica, commonly known as the stone liver plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apocynaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia, and is often found growing on rocks or trees. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and clusters of star-shaped, waxy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. Hoya lithophytica is a lithophytic species, meaning it grows on rocky surfaces, and it thrives in bright, indirect light with well-draining soil. Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in specific environments make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
