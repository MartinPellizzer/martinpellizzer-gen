    "intro": "Hieracium benzianum subsp. argillaceiforme, commonly known as the clay-leaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow disc flowers. The leaves are typically lanceolate and often covered with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in calcareous or clay soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. The plant is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its bright yellow blooms."
