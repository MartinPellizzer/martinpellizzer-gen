    "intro": "Hydrocharis asarifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf water shield, is a floating aquatic plant native to the Americas. It features broad, arrowhead-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with roots submerged in the water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, typically in the spring and summer months. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves provide habitat for small aquatic organisms, and it is often used in wetland restoration projects."
