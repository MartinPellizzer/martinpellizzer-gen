It is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, where it typically grows in rocky or arid environments. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers that appear in umbels. Its fruit is a dry, ribbed schizocarp that splits into two one-seeded parts upon maturity. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
