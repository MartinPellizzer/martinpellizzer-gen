    "intro": "Hamelia lanuginosa, commonly known as the wooly false heather, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and clusters of small, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and long blooming period. Hamelia lanuginosa is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
