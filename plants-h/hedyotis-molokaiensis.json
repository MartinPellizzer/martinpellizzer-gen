    "intro": "Hedyotis molokaiensis, commonly known as Molokai's inchplant, is a small herbaceous plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, spreading growth habit and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories on the island of Molokai. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
