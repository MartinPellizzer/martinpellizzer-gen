    "intro": "Hemicarpha axillaris, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its small, pink to purple flowers appear in dense, clustered inflorescences during the summer months. Hemicarpha axillaris is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in wetland landscapes."
