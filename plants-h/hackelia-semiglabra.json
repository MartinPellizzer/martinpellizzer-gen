It is characterized by its upright growth habit and opposite leaves that are typically lance-shaped and hairy when young. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a small, smooth, yellowish drupe that matures in the fall. Hackelia semiglabra is often found in woodland edges, open woods, and along streambanks, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight."
