It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers that are often greenish-yellow in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various wildlife species. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a decorative plant."
