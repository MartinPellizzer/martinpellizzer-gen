    "intro": "Hamosa layneae, commonly known as the Layne's hamosa, is a rare flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments, adapting to harsh desert conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hamosa layneae is considered a species of conservation concern."
