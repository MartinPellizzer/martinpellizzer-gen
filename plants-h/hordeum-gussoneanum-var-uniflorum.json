    "intro": "Hordeum gussoneanum var. uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flower barley, is a botanical variant of the genus Hordeum. It is characterized by its reduced floral structure, typically bearing only a single floret per spikelet. This plant is native to certain regions of Europe and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its morphology includes slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique floral characteristics and potential role in plant evolution."
