    "intro": "Hadrolaelia brevipedunculata, commonly known as the short-stemmed orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and green. The plant features a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its harsh, mountainous environment. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in the cold, arid conditions it inhabits. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
