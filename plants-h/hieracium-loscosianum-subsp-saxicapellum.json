    "intro": "Hieracium loscosianum subsp. saxicapellum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and tall, flowering stems that bear yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
