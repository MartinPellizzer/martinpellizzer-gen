    "intro": "Hieracium subnivale proles leucopsis, commonly known as the snowdrop hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features a rosette of pale green to white leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with ray florets that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in meadows and mountainous areas. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to cold climates, with a compact growth form and hairy foliage to reduce water loss."
