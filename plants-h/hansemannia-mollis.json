    "intro": "Hansemannia mollis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is known for its unique, elongated flower that resembles a ghostly figure. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without being parasitic, and relies on air, rain, and debris for nutrients. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a delicate, almost translucent appearance. Due to habitat loss and illegal collection, Hansemannia mollis is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
