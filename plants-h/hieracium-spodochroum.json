It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat, disk-like structure. Hieracium spodochroum is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
