    "intro": "Haworthia retusa f. acuminata, commonly known as the pointed Haworthia, is a compact, succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, pointed leaves that are typically green with white or yellowish markings. The leaves are densely packed and often have a waxy texture, which helps the plant store water efficiently. It produces small, white or pale green flowers on tall, slender stems during the warmer months. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements."
