    "intro": "Honckenya peploides subsp. peploides, commonly known as the coastal bladderwrack, is a perennial seaweed that thrives in intertidal zones along rocky shores. It is characterized by its dark green to brown, leathery fronds that are typically 10\u201330 cm in length. The plant forms dense mats on the substratum, providing habitat and shelter for various marine organisms. It reproduces both sexually and asexually through the release of spores and vegetative propagation. This species is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including wave action and desiccation."
