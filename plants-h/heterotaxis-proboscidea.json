    "intro": "Heterotaxis proboscidea, commonly known as the hookless bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor wetlands and bogs, where it supplements its nutrient intake through prey capture. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its stems may be floating or rooted in the substrate. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on specialized structures for anchoring and nutrient absorption."
