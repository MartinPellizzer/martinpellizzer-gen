    "intro": "Huperzia serrata, commonly known as the serrate huperzia, is a species of evergreen fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its tall, erect, sparsely branched stems and its distinctive, serrated leaflets. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of many ferns. Native to various regions in Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Huperzia serrata is often found in forests and rocky habitats, where it contributes to the understory vegetation."
