    "intro": "Hieracium auriculiforme subsp. suprafloccosum, commonly known as the golden hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features basal rosettes of broadly lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its inflorescence is characterized by a distinctive, flattened, floccose (fluffy) structure that gives it its subspecies name. The plant is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its bright, showy flowers."
