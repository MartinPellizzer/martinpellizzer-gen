    "intro": "Hypolepis rugosula var. poeppigii, commonly known as the Poeppig's sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves with a distinctive, rugged texture along the leaflets. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its fronds are evergreen, with a dark green color and a waxy surface that aids in water retention. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
