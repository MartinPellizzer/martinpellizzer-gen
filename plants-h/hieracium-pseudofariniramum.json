    "intro": "Hieracium pseudofariniramum, commonly known as the false mouse-ear hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in some areas. Its botanical features make it identifiable by its distinctive leaf morphology and floral structure."
