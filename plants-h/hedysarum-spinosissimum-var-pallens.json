    "intro": "Hedysarum spinosissimum var. pallens, commonly known as the pale thorned vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated for erosion control or as an ornamental plant."
