    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. serpentinicolor, commonly known as the serpent's tongue hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to calcareous grasslands and rocky soils in Europe. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in a single head and have a distinctive, flattened shape. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It is a perennial species that thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in many regions."
