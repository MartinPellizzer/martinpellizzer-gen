    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. macradenocephalum, commonly known as the large-headed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its notably large, rounded flower heads, which are often more prominent than those of other hawkweed species. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. This plant is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas across its native range."
