    "intro": "Hieracium sabaudum subsp. boreale, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high elevations, where it tolerates cold and harsh environmental conditions. The plant features a low-growing rosette of basal leaves and produces yellow flowers in early summer. Its leaves are typically hairy and have a serrated margin, while the flower heads are composed of small, rayless florets. This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth form and is often found in mountainous areas across the Alps and adjacent regions."
