    "intro": "Holcus grurnosus, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to the presence of dense pubescence on its leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Its flowers are small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny seeds. Holcus grurnosus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its ability to thrive in shaded conditions."
