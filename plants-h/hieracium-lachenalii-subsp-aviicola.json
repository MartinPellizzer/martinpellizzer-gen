It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellowish flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its morphology includes a creeping rhizome and small, hairy leaves that help it conserve moisture. The subspecies is distinguished by its specific habitat preferences and subtle differences in leaf and flower structure compared to other Hieracium species."
