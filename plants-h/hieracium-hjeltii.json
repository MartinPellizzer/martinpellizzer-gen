    "intro": "Hieracium hjeltii, commonly known as the Hjelt's hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, this plant thrives in rocky and dry habitats. It has small, hairy leaves and produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
