    "intro": "Hypoxis humilis, commonly known as the lesser star grass, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellowish-white flowers in late spring. The plant is characterized by its underground corm, which stores nutrients and allows it to survive dry periods. Hypoxis humilis is often found in grasslands and rocky outcrops, thriving in well-drained soil. Its botanical structure supports its role as a hardy, low-maintenance plant in both natural and cultivated settings."
