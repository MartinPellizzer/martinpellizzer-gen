    "intro": "Helichrysum glaciale, commonly known as the alpine everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, bright yellow to golden-orange flowers that resemble tiny suns, which remain intact even after the plant has dried. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows at high altitudes. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Helichrysum glaciale is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
