    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subvar. guinandii, commonly known as the Guinand's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
