    "intro": "Holodiscus discolor var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-leaved holodiscus, is a variant of the holodiscus discolor, a member of the Malvaceae family. It is a shrub characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves that are typically oval to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or rocky habitats. This variant is notable for its reduced pubescence compared to the typical form, making it distinct in appearance."
