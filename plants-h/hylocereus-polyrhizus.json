    "intro": "Hylocereus polyrhizus, commonly known as the dragon fruit plant, is a cactus species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, segmented stems and clusters of fragrant, white flowers. The plant produces bright-colored, fleshy fruits with a sweet, mildly tropical flavor. It thrives in warm, arid climates and requires well-draining soil. Its ability to store water in its stems makes it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping."
