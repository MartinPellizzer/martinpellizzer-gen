    "intro": "Hemipilia calcicola, commonly known as the limestone hemipilia, is a rare perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in rocky or limestone habitats. Its botanical features include lanceolate leaves and a unique floral structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemipilia calcicola is considered an endangered species."
