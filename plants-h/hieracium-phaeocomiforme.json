It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring temperate climates. Its leaves are dark green and often have a slightly hairy texture, while the flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer. Hieracium phaeocomiforme is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
