    "intro": "Heterolaena orgyalis, commonly known as the yellow panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically yellow-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale yellow to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Heterolaena orgyalis is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for livestock in certain regions."
