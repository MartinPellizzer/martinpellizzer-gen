    "intro": "Hypericum subalatum, commonly known as the alpine St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine soils where temperatures are cool and conditions are harsh. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white hair. Hypericum subalatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
