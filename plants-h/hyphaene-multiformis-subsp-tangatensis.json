    "intro": "Hyphaene multiformis subsp. tangatensis, commonly known as the giant fan palm, is a tall, slender palm native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter. The plant produces long, slender fruits that are typically yellow or orange when mature. It thrives in coastal and dry forest environments, often growing in sandy or limestone soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
