    "intro": "Haworthia fulva, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are often marked with distinctive white or yellow markings resembling a zebra's stripes. The plant thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. Haworthia fulva is popular as a low-maintenance houseplant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
