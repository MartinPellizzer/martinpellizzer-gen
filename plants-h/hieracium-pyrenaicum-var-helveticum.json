    "intro": "Hieracium pyrenaicum var. helveticum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow daisy-like flowers and hairy, rough-textured leaves. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and sunny exposures. It is known for its low-growing habit and ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
