    "intro": "Hymenophyllum mikawanum, commonly known as the Mikawan fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures called trichomes, which help reduce water loss. This species is notable for its intricate leaf venation and is often found in montane forests."
