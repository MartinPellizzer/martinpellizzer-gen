It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with five-angled leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Its seed pods are linear and contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Hedysarum quinqueangulatum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability in ecological restoration."
