    "intro": "Hyacinthus maritimus, commonly known as the sea hyacinth, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts of Europe and Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers, which bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils near the shoreline. It is often found in salt marshes and along the edges of tidal pools. Hyacinthus maritimus is adapted to saline environments and plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils."
