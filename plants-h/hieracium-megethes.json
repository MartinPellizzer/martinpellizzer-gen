    "intro": "Hieracium megethes, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow to orange composite flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hieracium megethes is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, where it can sometimes become invasive."
