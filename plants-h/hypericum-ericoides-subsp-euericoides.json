    "intro": "Hypericum ericoides subsp. euericoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved St. John's wort, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It typically features small, rounded leaves that are densely packed along its stems. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are characteristic of the Hypericaceae family. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it suitable for rock gardens and woodland settings. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight."
