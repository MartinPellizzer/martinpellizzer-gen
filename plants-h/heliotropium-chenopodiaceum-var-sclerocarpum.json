    "intro": "Heliotropium chenopodiaceum var. sclerocarpum, commonly known as the desert heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the mallow family (Malvaceae) and is characterized by its small, showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has hairy, branching stems and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots and a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. This species is often found in sandy soils and is used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
