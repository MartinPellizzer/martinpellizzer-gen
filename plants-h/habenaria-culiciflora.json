    "intro": "Habenaria culiciflora, commonly known as the mosquito orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its unique, mosquito-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with red markings. The plant produces a single spike of flowers, each with a distinctive, elongated lip that mimics the appearance of a mosquito. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
