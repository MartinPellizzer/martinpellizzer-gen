    "intro": "Hebanthe hookeriana, commonly known as the Hooker's hebanthe, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its delicate, palmately lobed leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
