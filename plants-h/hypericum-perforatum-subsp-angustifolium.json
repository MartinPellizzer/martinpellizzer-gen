    "intro": "Hypericum perforatum subsp. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, yellow flowers with four petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Hypericaceae family. The leaves are narrow and often have translucent glands that give the plant its scientific name. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. This subspecies is similar to the more widely known Hypericum perforatum but has narrower leaves and slightly different floral characteristics."
