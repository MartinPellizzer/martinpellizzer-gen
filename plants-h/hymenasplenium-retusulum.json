    "intro": "Hymenasplenium retusulum, commonly known as the broad-leafed woodfern, is a fern species native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, intricate fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. The plant's rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable environments."
