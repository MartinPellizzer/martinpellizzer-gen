    "intro": "Hedycarya, commonly known as the honeylocust, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It includes several species, such as Hedycarya lyceum and Hedycarya microphylla, which are native to regions in Asia and the Americas. The plants are characterized by their compound leaves, often with small, delicate leaflets, and their showy, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators. Hedycarya species are typically shrubs or small trees, and they produce pods that contain seeds. These plants are valued for their ornamental qualities and have been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
