    "intro": "Helianthemum guttatum var. milleri, commonly known as the Mill's cushion sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fleshy, greenish-yellow leaves that are covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous areas. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
