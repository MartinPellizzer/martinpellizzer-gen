    "intro": "Hieracium pseudodollineri subsp. psammogenitropum, commonly known as the sand-dwelling hawkweed, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to arid and sandy environments. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite inflorescences, typical of the daisy family. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This subspecies is found in specific regions of southern Europe, where it thrives in nutrient-poor, sandy soils."
