It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that can range in color from white to pink and blue, depending on soil pH. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by persistent, showy bracts. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a rough texture, while its stems are covered in fine hairs.
