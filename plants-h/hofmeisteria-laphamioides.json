    "intro": "Hofmeisteria laphamioides, commonly known as the dwarf hofmeisteria, is a small shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 feet and features dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by red berries that attract birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact size and ornamental berries make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
