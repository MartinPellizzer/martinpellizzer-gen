    "intro": "Homalium pseudoboinense, commonly known as the Guatemalan beautyberry, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to Central America, particularly Guatemala, and is characterized by its showy, clustered inflorescences that resemble berries. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub in humid, tropical forests, preferring shady and moist conditions. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a glossy appearance, while its flowers are small and greenish-white. The fruit is fleshy and reddish, attracting various bird species and playing a role in seed dispersal."
