    "intro": "Heliotropium ottonianum, commonly known as the velvetleaf heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its flowers open in the morning and close in the afternoon, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Heliotropium ottonianum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
