    "intro": "Harveya randii, commonly known as the Red Mountain orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its vivid red and orange flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Harveya randii has a compact growth habit with a pseudobulb-like structure and is known for its ornamental value. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in some regions."
