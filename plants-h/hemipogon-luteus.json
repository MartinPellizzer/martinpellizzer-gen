    "intro": "Hemipogon luteus, commonly known as the yellow bristly grass, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, yellowish flowers. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Hemipogon luteus is primarily valued for its role in ecological systems rather than for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
