    "intro": "Hieracium umbelluliferum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its bright yellow flowers bloom from June to August, and it produces seeds in a fluffy pappus that aids in wind dispersal. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs."
