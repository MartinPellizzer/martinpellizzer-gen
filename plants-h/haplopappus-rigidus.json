    "intro": "Haplopappus rigidus, commonly known as the rigid pappus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive bracts. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The small, yellowish flowers appear in clusters and are followed by bristly, wind-dispersed seeds."
