It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun. It has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Hieracium ptilophorum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
