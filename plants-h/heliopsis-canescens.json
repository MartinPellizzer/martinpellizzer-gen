    "intro": "Heliopsis canescens, commonly known as the frostweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery-white down, which gives it a frost-like appearance. Heliopsis canescens is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist habitats, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
