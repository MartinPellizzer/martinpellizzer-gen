It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped with finely toothed margins, and it produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The species is often found in open habitats and is relatively hardy, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
