    "intro": "Habenella obtusa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf habenula, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, woodlands and stream banks, preferring partial to full shade. The plant has slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its small, white to pale blue flowers appear in clusters and bloom in late spring to early summer. Habenella obtusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for native pollinators."
