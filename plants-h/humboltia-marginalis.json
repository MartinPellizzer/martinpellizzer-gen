    "intro": "Humboltia marginalis, commonly known as the coast hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of South America. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, thriving in salty, windy environments. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Humboltia marginalis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms."
