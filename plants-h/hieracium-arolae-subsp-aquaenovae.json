    "intro": "Hieracium arolae subsp. aquaenovae, commonly known as the aquatic hawkweed, is a rare and specialized plant species adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its clustered, herbaceous growth habit. The plant typically features narrow, linear leaves and small, yellowish to brownish flowers arranged in composite inflorescences. It is found in specific wetland habitats, often in areas with slow-moving water or moist soil. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
