It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with ray florets. Hieracium eucallum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common and sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
