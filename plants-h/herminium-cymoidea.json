    "intro": "Herminium cymoidea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with reduced leaves. The plant produces small, pale green or white flowers arranged in a raceme, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Herminium cymoidea is notable for its mycorrhizal relationship with fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake."
