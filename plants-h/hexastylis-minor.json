    "intro": "Hexastylis minor, commonly known as the small-leaf false shamrock, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The flowers are often overlooked due to their modest size, but they play a role in attracting small pollinators."
