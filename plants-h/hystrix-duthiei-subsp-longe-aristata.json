It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage that forms a compact rosette. The leaves are typically blue-green in color and have long, stiff spines along their edges. It produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. This subspecies is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
