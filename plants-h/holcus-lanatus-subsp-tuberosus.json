    "intro": "Holcus lanatus subsp. tuberosus, commonly known as the tuberous hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. One of its notable features is the presence of underground tubers, which contribute to its survival in various environmental conditions. It is often found in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
