It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically blooming in spring and early summer. The plant has leathery, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to rocky and coastal environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscaping."
