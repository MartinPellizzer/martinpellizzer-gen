    "intro": "Hieracium tortifolium, commonly known as the curled-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features basal rosettes of deeply lobed, hairy leaves that are often curled or twisted, giving it its common name. It produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Hieracium tortifolium is typically found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
