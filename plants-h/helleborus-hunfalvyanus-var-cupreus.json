    "intro": "Helleborus hunfalvyanus var. cupreus, commonly known as the Copper Hellebore, is a rare and striking plant native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and distinctive, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from pale green to coppery hues. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forested areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its flowers bloom in late winter or early spring, making it one of the earliest flowering plants in its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
