    "intro": "Heuchera flabellifolia, commonly known as the fan-leaved coral bells, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often brightly colored in shades of red, purple, and green. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Heuchera flabellifolia is valued for its ornamental foliage and its ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
