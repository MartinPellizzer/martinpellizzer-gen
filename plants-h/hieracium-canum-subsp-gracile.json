    "intro": "Hieracium canum subsp. gracile, commonly known as slender hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster. It is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively."
