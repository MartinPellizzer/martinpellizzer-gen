It is a herbaceous perennial with slender, upright stems that bear small, greenish-white flowers arranged in racemes. The leaves are narrow and linear, typically less than 1 cm wide, and are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland regions with well-drained conditions. This species is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant once established."
