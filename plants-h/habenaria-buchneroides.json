    "intro": "Habenaria buchneroides, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a single or few flowers that are usually pale green to yellowish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered flowers with a distinctive, intricate structure. This orchid is relatively rare and is often found in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its growth."
