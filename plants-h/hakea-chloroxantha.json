    "intro": "Hakea chloroxantha, commonly known as the yellow hakea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescences that produce yellow flowers, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant has needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and heathland environments. Hakea chloroxantha is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
