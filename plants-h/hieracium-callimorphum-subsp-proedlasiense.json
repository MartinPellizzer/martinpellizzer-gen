    "intro": "Hieracium callimorphum subsp. proedlasiense, commonly known as the Alpine Hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow flowers arranged in a composite head. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. It has a taproot system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
