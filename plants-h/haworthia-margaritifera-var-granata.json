    "intro": "Haworthia margaritifera var. granata, commonly known as the \"Coral Haworthia,\" is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically pale green with red or pinkish markings, especially under sunlight. The leaves are covered in a fine, white powdery coating called farina, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers on tall, slender stems during the warmer months. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and ornamental appeal."
