    "intro": "Hypericum elongatum, commonly known as the yellow archangel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, ascending stems that often form dense mats, with opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its medicinal properties have been historically used in traditional remedies, though it contains toxic compounds. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
