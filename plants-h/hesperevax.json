    "intro": "Hesperevax, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. The plant is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting moths for pollination. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Hesperevax produces small, round berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife."
