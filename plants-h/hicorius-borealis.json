    "intro": "Hicorius borealis, commonly known as the northern horned orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Arctic tundra. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its environment. The plant produces small, pale yellow or greenish flowers with a unique horn-like structure on its petals. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, helping to reduce water loss in the freezing climate. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species with limited distribution."
