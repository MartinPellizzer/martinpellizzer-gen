    "intro": "Hieracium pseudoleyi, commonly known as the false hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and can form dense colonies. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with hairy surfaces, and the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium pseudoleyi is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
