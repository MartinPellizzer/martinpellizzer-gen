    "intro": "Hedysarum alpinum subvar. glabrum, commonly known as the alpine sweet clover, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its glabrous (smooth) stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Hedysarum alpinum subvar. glabrum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
