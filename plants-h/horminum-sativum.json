    "intro": "Horminum sativum, commonly known as the common barley, is a cereal grain that belongs to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stalks and small, spikelet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and produces grains that are harvested when they are dry and mature. Its leaves are narrow and parallel-veined, and the plant is well-adapted to temperate climates. Barley is widely cultivated for its seeds, which are used in food, animal feed, and brewing."
