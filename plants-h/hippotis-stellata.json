    "intro": "Hippotis stellata, commonly known as starleaf sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that typically reaches a height of less than 10 centimeters. The plant features small, star-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it its common name. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink and are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences. Hippotis stellata is adapted to harsh environments, with succulent leaves that help it conserve water."
