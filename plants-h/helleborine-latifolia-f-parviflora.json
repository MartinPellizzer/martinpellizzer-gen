    "intro": "Helleborine latifolia f. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered broad-leaf helleborine, is a rare orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and smaller, pale greenish-white flowers compared to the typical form. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats, thriving in rich, humusy soils. It is a perennial herb that produces showy, often fragrant blooms during late spring to early summer. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
