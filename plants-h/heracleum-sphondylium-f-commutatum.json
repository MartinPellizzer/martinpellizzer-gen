    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium f. commutatum, commonly known as the lesser cow parsley, is a variant of the common hogweed. It is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and umbrella-shaped inflorescences. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. It grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Due to its similarity to more toxic hogweeds, it requires careful identification to avoid confusion."
