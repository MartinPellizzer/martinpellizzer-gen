    "intro": "Hieraciodes caucasica, commonly known as Caucasian hieracium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caucasus region. It typically grows in rocky or mountainous areas, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, while its flowering stems bear yellow composite flowers. It produces small, oval fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
