    "intro": "Hieracium cottetii subsp. subhumile, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 centimeters and features a rosette of basal leaves that are usually hairy and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellowish flower heads that are surrounded by pale green bracts, which are characteristic of the genus Hieracium. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
