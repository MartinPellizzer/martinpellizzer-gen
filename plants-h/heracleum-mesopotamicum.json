    "intro": "Heracleum mesopotamicum, commonly known as the Mesopotamian cowparade, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence. It is a tall, herbaceous plant that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with hollow, ridged stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small white to greenish flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, which are typically borne on long, slender stalks. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. Native to the Middle East and Central Asia, it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments."
