    "intro": "Hieracium gudissiense, commonly known as the Gudissi hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its yellow flowers bloom in late summer, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
