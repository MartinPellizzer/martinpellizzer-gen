    "intro": "Holcus spicatus, commonly known as rough bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and roadside areas. The plant has slender, creeping stems that produce dense clusters of spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow, rough to the touch, and often have a bluish-green color. Holcus spicatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
