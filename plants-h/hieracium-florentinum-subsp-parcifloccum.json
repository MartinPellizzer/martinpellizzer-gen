    "intro": "Hieracium florentinum subsp. parcifloccum, commonly known as the Florentine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and produces numerous small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in a dense, fluffy inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and along stream banks. It has finely toothed leaves and a hairy stem, which help it retain moisture and deter herbivores. This subspecies is native to parts of Europe and is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils."
