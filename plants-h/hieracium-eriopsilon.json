    "intro": "Hieracium eriopsilon, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its leaves are usually hairy and lance-shaped, while the flowers are yellow with ray florets. Hieracium eriopsilon is often considered a weed but can play a role in supporting local pollinators."
