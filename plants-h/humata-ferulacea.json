    "intro": "Humata ferulacea, commonly known as the golden tamarind, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, woody stem and pinnate leaves with lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. The seeds are encased in a hard, woody shell and are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of oil. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth."
