    "intro": "Heuchera cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf alumroot, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features dense, dark green foliage with a slightly hairy texture, and its leaves are typically narrow and elongated. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are borne on upright, branching stems. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Heuchera cuneata is valued for its ornamental foliage and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
