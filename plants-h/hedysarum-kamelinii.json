    "intro": "Hedysarum kamelinii, commonly known as the Kamelin's vetch, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Hedysarum kamelinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in its native habitat."
