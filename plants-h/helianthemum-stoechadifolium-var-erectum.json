    "intro": "Helianthemum stoechadifolium var. erectum, commonly known as the upright stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Scottish Highlands. It features compact, upright stems with small, fleshy, waxy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal and alpine environments. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscaping."
