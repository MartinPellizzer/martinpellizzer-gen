It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its golden-yellow, dandelion-like flowers that retain their color and form even after drying. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its widespread distribution. Its foliage is usually hairy and aromatic, with a slightly bitter taste. Helichrysum athanaton is often used in traditional medicine and as a decorative plant due to its long-lasting blooms."
