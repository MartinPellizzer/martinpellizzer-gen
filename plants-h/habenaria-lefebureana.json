    "intro": "Habenaria lefebureana, commonly known as the Lefebure's orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest understories. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption. The orchid's botanical structure reflects its adaptation to humid, low-light environments."
