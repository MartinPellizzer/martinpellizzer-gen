    "intro": "Hedera colchica var. arborescens, commonly known as the tree ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to the Caucasus region. It features dark green, glossy leaves that are typically heart-shaped with a pointed tip. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
