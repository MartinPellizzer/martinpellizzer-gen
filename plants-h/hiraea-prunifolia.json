    "intro": "Hiraea prunifolia, commonly known as the cherryleaf hiraea, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of cherry trees, hence its common name. It produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring. The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that ripens to a dark purple color, often attracting birds and small mammals."
