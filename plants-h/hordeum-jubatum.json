    "intro": "Hordeum jubatum, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, silver-haired inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive silvery sheen on the upper surface. Hordeum jubatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
