    "intro": "Helleborus orientalis var. guttatus, commonly known as the spotted hellebore, is a perennial evergreen plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves with distinctive white or pale spots along the veins. The plant produces clusters of waxy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets."
