    "intro": "Hakea agrifolia, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is an evergreen shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and covered in a fine layer of wax. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. Hakea agrifolia is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
