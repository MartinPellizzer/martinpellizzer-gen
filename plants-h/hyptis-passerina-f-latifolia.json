    "intro": "Hyptis passerina f. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf hyptis, is a perennial herb native to the warm climates of the Americas. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its aromatic, hairy leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny environments such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. The broad, lance-shaped foliage of this variety distinguishes it from other forms of Hyptis passerina."
