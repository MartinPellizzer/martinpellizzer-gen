It is characterized by its clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually smooth and dark green in color. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The fruit is a small, red drupe that attracts birds and persists through the winter."
