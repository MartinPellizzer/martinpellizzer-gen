    "intro": "Hieracium pseudodentatum, commonly known as the false hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture, and its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium pseudodentatum is often considered a weed due to its rapid spread and ability to colonize various habitats."
