    "intro": "Habenaria vandenbergheniana, commonly known as the Vandenbergh's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with prominent sepals and petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
