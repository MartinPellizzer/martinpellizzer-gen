    "intro": "Hymenophyllum micranthum, commonly known as the small-flowered fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Hymenophyllum micranthum is known for its unique morphology and is often found in humid, tropical forests."
