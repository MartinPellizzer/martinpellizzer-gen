    "intro": "Hierochloe hirta subsp. praetermissa, commonly known as the hairy false oat, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, hairy leaves and slender, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and forest edges. It has a clump-forming growth habit and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its botanical features make it identifiable within the Poaceae family, though it is often confused with other similar grasses."
