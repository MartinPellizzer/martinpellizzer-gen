    "intro": "Helichrysum fruticosum var. compactum, commonly known as the compact everlasting, is a low-growing, succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, giving it a long-lasting appearance. The plant has narrow, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its aromatic foliage and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
