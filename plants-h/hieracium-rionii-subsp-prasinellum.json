It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, dark green leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the genus Hieracium. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it distinguishable from other hawkweed species due to its unique leaf coloration and growth habit."
