    "intro": "Hebenstretia rariflora, commonly known as the rare-flowered hebenstretia, is a striking member of the Apocynaceae family native to South Africa. It is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, often with contrasting yellow markings. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, and features opposite, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native region."
