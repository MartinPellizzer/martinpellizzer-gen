    "intro": "Hulsea larsenii, commonly known as the Larsen's hulsea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is characterized by its small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Hulsea larsenii is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. Its foliage is usually narrow and grass-like, with small, rounded leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat."
