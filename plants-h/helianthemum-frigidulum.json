    "intro": "Helianthemum frigidulum, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Helianthemum frigidulum is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes other flowering plants with similar adaptations to harsh climates."
