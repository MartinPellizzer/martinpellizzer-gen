    "intro": "Heracleum sibiricum subsp. ternatum, commonly known as Siberian cowparsley, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to temperate regions of Asia. It features a robust taproot and a tall, hollow stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces large, umbrella-like compound leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are dry, two-lobed schizocarps that disperse via wind, and the plant is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. It is characterized by its distinctive, aromatic foliage and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
