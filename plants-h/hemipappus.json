    "intro": "Hemipappus, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their composite flower heads, which consist of both ray and disk flowers. The leaves are typically alternate, lanceolate, and often hairy, with a rough texture. Hemipappus species are native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America and are often found in disturbed soils. Their seeds are equipped with a pappus, a feathery structure that aids in wind dispersal."
