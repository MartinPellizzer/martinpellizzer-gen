    "intro": "Hypserpa calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola thistle, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Hypserpa calcicola plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
