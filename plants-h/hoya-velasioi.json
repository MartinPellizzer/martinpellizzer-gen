    "intro": "Hoya velasioi, commonly known as the velvet hoya, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that give it a velvety appearance, and its clusters of star-shaped, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, white or pale pink blossoms that bloom in late summer or early autumn. Hoya velasioi thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and ornamental beauty."
