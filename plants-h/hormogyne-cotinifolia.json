    "intro": "Hormogyne cotinifolia, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Hormogyne cotinifolia is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
