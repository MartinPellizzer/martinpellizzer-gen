    "intro": "Heterothalamus rupestris, commonly known as the rock heterothalamus, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring two distinct types of flowers on the same inflorescence, a trait known as heterothallism. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are arranged in umbels, and it produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecological studies."
