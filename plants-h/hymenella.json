    "intro": "Hymenella, commonly known as the fairy ring mushroom, is a genus of fungi belonging to the family Tricholomataceae. These fungi are typically found in temperate regions and are known for forming circular, often ephemeral growths called fairy rings. The fruiting bodies of Hymenella species are usually small, with a cap that ranges from white to brown in color. They have gills that are initially pale but may darken with age, and the spores are produced on the hymenium, a layer of tissue beneath the cap. Hymenella mushrooms are generally considered edible but should be approached with caution due to their similarity to poisonous species."
