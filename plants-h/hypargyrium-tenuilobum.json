    "intro": "Hypargyrium tenuilobum, commonly known as the slender-lobed hypargyrium, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to parts of Central America and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
