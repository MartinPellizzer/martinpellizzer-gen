    "intro": "Hypericum subquadrangulare, commonly known as the narrow-leaved St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to southeastern Europe and western Asia. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant has opposite, narrow, and often slightly hairy leaves that are characteristic of the genus Hypericum. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its medicinal properties have been historically explored, though it is less commonly used than other Hypericum species."
