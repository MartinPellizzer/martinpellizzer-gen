    "intro": "Hypericum empetrifolium subsp. oliganthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved St. John's wort, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five\u82b1\u74e3, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in open, sun-exposed habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects in harsh environments."
