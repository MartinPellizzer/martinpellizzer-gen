    "intro": "Heliotropium undulatum var. suffruticescens, commonly known as the creeping heliotrope, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often hairy and have a velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink or purple, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread and form dense mats."
