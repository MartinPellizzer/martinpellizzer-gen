    "intro": "Holcus sorghum var. saccharatus, commonly known as sweet grass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and fine, feather-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the grass family. Sweet grass is often used in traditional crafts and rituals due to its aromatic properties and fibrous texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks."
