    "intro": "Hoya evelinae, commonly known as the \"Snow Queen\" hoya, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tropical rainforests. Hoya evelinae thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its slow growth and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
