    "intro": "Hieracium peleterianum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and roadsides. Its yellow flowers are surrounded by a ring of pale yellow to white ray florets, and it produces numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Hieracium peleterianum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize various environments."
