It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with elongated, elliptical leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, red flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a globose capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds. This species is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky slopes."
