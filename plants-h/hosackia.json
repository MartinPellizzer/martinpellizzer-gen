    "intro": "Hosackia, commonly known as the prairie clover, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to North America and are typically found in prairie and open woodland habitats. Hosackia species are characterized by their showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from yellow to reddish-brown. They have trifoliate leaves and are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. The genus includes several species, such as Hosackia missouriensis and Hosackia stipulata, which vary in growth habits and flower morphology."
