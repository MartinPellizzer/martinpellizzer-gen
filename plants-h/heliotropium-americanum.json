    "intro": "Heliotropium americanum, commonly known as American heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring hairy stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its flowers are notable for their ability to follow the sun, a trait known as heliotropism. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
