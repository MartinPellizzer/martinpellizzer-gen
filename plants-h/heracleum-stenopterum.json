    "intro": "Heracleum stenopterum, commonly known as narrow-leaved cow parsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbrella-like inflorescences, which attract pollinators. The roots are thick and fleshy, resembling those of related plants like parsley and carrots."
