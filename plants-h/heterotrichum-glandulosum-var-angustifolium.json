    "intro": "Heterotrichum glandulosum var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bog moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Hypnaceae. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrow and pointed, with a distinct midrib. The plant forms dense, cushion-like mats in acidic, moist environments such as bogs and wet meadows. Its leaves are often covered with small, glandular dots, which contribute to its scientific name. This moss plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms in its native habitat."
