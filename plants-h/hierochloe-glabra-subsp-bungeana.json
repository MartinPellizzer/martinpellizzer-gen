    "intro": "Hierochloe glabra subsp. bungeana, commonly known as Bunge's hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to central and eastern Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, tufted stems with fine, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a soft, hairy texture. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates."
