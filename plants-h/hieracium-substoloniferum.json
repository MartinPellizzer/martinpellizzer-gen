    "intro": "Hieracium substoloniferum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, forming dense mats due to its stoloniferous growth habit. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. The species is known for its ability to spread rapidly and can sometimes become invasive in certain regions."
