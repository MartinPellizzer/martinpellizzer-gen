It is characterized by its yellow flowering heads and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes. It produces small, disc-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecological niche."
