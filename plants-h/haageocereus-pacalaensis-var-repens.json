It is a low-growing, sprawling plant with fleshy stems that store water, typical of desert environments. The plant produces nocturnal flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry climates."
