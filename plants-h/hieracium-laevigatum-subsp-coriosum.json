    "intro": "Hieracium laevigatum subsp. coriosum, commonly known as the smooth hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its clustered, yellowish to reddish flowering heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and roadsides. It has smooth, often hairy leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into achene fruits. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it can compete with native plant species and alter local ecosystems."
