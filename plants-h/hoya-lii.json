    "intro": "Hoya lii, commonly known as the \"Hoya of the Philippines,\" is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It features waxy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a slight sheen. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Hoya lii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for hanging baskets or as a tabletop plant."
