    "intro": "Hieracium cymellum, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, and the plant can grow up to 30 centimeters tall. Hieracium cymellum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to colonize new areas."
