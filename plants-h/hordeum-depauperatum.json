    "intro": "Hordeum depauperatum, commonly known as the poor grass, is a species of wild barley native to Eurasia. It is a small, annual grass that typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny grains. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and a lack of awns, which distinguish it from other barley species. It is often found in arid or semi-arid regions and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient environments."
