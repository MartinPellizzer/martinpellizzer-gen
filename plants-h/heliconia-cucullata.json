    "intro": "Heliconia cucullata, commonly known as the hooded heliconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, colorful bracts that resemble a crown, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers inside the bracts, which are pollinated by birds such as hummingbirds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps in moist, shaded environments. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
