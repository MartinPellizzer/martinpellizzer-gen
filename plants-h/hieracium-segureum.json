    "intro": "Hieracium segureum, commonly known as the Segureum hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It features basal leaves that are usually heart-shaped or lobed, and its yellow flowers are surrounded by a ring of ray florets. Hieracium segureum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
