    "intro": "Hypoxis hockii var. katangensis, commonly known as the Katanga hypoxis, is a flowering plant native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the base of the leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
