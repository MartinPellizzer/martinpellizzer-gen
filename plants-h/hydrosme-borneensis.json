    "intro": "Hydrosme borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean hydrosme, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that are typically bright red or orange. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing along the forest floor or on rocky substrates. Its leaves are usually ovate with a smooth surface, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
