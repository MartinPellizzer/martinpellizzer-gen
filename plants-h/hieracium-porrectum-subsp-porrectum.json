    "intro": "Hieracium porrectum subsp. porrectum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and yellow composite flowers that are typically arranged in a single head. The plant has basal and stem leaves that are broadly lance-shaped with serrated edges. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in a variety of habitats including meadows and roadsides. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed."
