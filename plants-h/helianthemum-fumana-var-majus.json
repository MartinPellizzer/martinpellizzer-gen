    "intro": "Helianthemum fumana var. majus, commonly known as the greater rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in sunny, well-drained environments. The plant produces showy, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually small, leathery, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and vibrant blooms."
