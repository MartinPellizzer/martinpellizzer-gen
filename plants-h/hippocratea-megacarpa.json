    "intro": "Hippocratea megacarpa, commonly known as the giant hippocratea, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter, typically in shades of yellow and orange. The plant produces woody capsules as fruits, which contain numerous seeds enclosed in a fleshy aril. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Hippocratea megacarpa is primarily grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique and vibrant floral display."
