    "intro": "Histiopteris integrifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, leathery fronds that are typically divided into segments with a distinctive holly-like appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a row along the veins. Histiopteris integrifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
