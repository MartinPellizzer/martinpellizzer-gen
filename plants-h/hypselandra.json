    "intro": "Hypselandra, commonly known as the tree fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araliaceae. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that resemble tree trunks, often covered in a fibrous, spongy layer. The plant produces a crown of large, feather-like leaves at the top, which can grow up to several meters in length. Hypselandra species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, moist environments. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated as houseplants or in botanical gardens."
