    "intro": "Haumaniastrum paniculatum, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its hairy, succulent stems and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. The species is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh desert conditions."
