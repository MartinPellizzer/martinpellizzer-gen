    "intro": "Hevea brasiliensis f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rubber tree, is a botanical variant of the rubber tree native to the Amazon basin. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are narrower than those of the typical Hevea brasiliensis. This form is primarily cultivated for its latex production, which is used in the manufacture of rubber products. The plant thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and consistent temperatures. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and economic contexts."
