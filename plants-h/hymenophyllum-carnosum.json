    "intro": "Hymenophyllum carnosum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Hymenophyllum carnosum is notable for its ability to retain moisture, which is essential for its survival in its natural habitat."
