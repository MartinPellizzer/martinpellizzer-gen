    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. angustellum, commonly known as narrow-leaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences. Its flowers are composed of ray florets and are surrounded by a dense involucre of bracts. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name."
