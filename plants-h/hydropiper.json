    "intro": "Hydropiper, commonly known as water pepper, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Piperaceae. It is characterized by its small, green, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers. The plant is often found growing in moist or wet environments, such as marshes and stream banks. Its stems are covered in fine, hair-like structures that help retain moisture. Hydropiper is also known for its peppery scent, which is released when the leaves are crushed."
