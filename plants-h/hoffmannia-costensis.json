    "intro": "Hoffmannia costensis, commonly known as the coastal hoffmannia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Hoffmannia costensis thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and wind exposure. It plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and is of interest for its ecological and ornamental value."
