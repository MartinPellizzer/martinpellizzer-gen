    "intro": "Hemionitis lessonii, commonly known as the rock fern, is a unique aquatic fern native to the western United States. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands, often growing on rocks or submerged substrates. Its fronds are typically narrow and strap-like, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Hemionitis lessonii is notable for its ability to tolerate both aquatic and terrestrial conditions, making it an adaptable and resilient species."
