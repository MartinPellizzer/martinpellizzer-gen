    "intro": "Heracleum taylorii, commonly known as Taylor's cowparn, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. It is native to Central Asia and is typically found in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant features tall, hollow stems with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white hairs. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, arranged in compound umbels, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Heracleum taylorii is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep roots and a low profile to reduce water loss."
