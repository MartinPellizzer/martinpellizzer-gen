    "intro": "Hancea labordei, commonly known as the Lepidoptera orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricately patterned flowers that resemble the wings of moths. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in dense rainforests. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the forest floor, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss, Hancea labordei is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
