    "intro": "Hypolaena lateriflora var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf hypolaena, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually yellow or orange, arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in dry climates."
