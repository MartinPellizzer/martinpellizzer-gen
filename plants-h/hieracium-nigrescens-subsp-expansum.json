It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are broad, lanceolate, and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat, disc-like cluster. It is known for its rapid spread and is considered a weed in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit."
