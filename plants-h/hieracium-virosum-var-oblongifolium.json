It is a perennial herb with a rosette of basal leaves that are typically broad and oval in shape. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a single stem, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, and it has a deep root system that helps it thrive in disturbed soils. It is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides."
