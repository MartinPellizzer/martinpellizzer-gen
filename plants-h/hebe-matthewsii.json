    "intro": "Hebe matthewsii, commonly known as the Stewart Island hebe, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and attractive blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in the understorey of forests on Stewart Island. Hebe matthewsii has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, tubular flowers that attract native pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
