    "intro": "Hieracium prothales, commonly known as the showy hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in summer, and the plant produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium prothales is often considered a weed but has ecological value in supporting pollinators."
