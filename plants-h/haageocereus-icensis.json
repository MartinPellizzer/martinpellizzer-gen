It is characterized by its distinct appearance, featuring a brightly colored upper part known as the \"skirt\" and a green, stem-like base. The plant is a hybrid between two different cactus species, which contributes to its unique coloration. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires plenty of sunlight to maintain its vibrant hues. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in rock gardens."
