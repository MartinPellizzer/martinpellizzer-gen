    "intro": "Hieracium praethulense, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the summer months, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium praethulense is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
