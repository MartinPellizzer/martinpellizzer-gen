    "intro": "Helictotrichon neesii, commonly known as the Nees' bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant features fine, blue-green foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture, and it is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils. Helictotrichon neesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
