    "intro": "Hebe corymbosa, commonly known as the mountain hebe, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, which bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
