    "intro": "Haageocereus humifusus, commonly known as the flat-topped cactus, is a low-growing, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a rounded, flat-topped stem that often branches out, forming a dense, mat-like structure. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It is often found in rocky soils and is well adapted to full sun exposure."
