    "intro": "Heliconia strelizia, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a striking tropical plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features large, showy inflorescences that resemble a cluster of small, brightly colored flowers, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional medicine and as a wrapping for food. Its roots are edible and have a mild, nutty flavor, making it a valuable resource in local cuisines. The sacred lotus is also culturally significant in many Asian societies, symbolizing purity and spiritual enlightenment."
