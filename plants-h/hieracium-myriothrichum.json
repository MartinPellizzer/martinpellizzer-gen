    "intro": "Hieracium myriothrichum, commonly known as the many-bracted hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a distinctive, multi-bracted structure. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
