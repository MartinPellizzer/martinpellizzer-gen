    "intro": "Hedysarum neli-tali, commonly known as the Neli-Tali milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and steppe environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
