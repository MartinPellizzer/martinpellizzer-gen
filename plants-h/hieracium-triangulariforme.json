    "intro": "Hieracium triangulariforme, commonly known as the triangular hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. It has hairy stems and leaves with a distinctive triangular shape, which gives it its scientific name. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native plants in certain regions."
