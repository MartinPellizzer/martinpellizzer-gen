    "intro": "Hutera hispida subsp. transtagana, commonly known as the hairy hutera, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, where it adapts well to dry and nutrient-poor conditions. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and flower structure compared to the main species."
