    "intro": "Hieracium prenanthoides subsp. penicense, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering heads that produce yellow disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It has finely divided, grass-like leaves and is often found in moist or calcareous soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
