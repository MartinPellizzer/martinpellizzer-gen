    "intro": "Hieracium paramecodes, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. The plant has basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stem is usually hairy and grows upright. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it a common sight in temperate regions, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
