    "intro": "Hieracium lachnaeum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Hieracium lachnaeum is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain habitats."
