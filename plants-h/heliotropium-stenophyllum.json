    "intro": "Heliotropium stenophyllum, commonly known as narrow-leaved heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually violet or purple in color. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, which helps in reducing water loss in arid environments. Heliotropium stenophyllum is adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and can often be found in dry grasslands or along roadsides."
