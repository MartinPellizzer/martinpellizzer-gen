    "intro": "Helichrysum uhligii, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellow to golden-orange flowers that remain open for a long period, giving it a dried flower appearance. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Helichrysum uhligii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in floral arrangements."
