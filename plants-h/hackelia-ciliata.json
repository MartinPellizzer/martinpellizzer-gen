    "intro": "Hackelia ciliata, commonly known as the fringed honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have fine, silky hairs along the edges. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable plant for rock gardens and dry landscapes. The plant is also noted for its attractive seed pods that persist into winter, adding ornamental value beyond the flowering season."
