It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are deeply lobed and serrated, with a rough texture, and it produces yellow flowers in late summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its variable leaf shape and size, contributing to its common name."
