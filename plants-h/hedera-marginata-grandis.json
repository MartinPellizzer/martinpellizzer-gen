    "intro": "Hedera marginata-grandis, commonly known as the giant marginated ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to parts of Asia. It features dark green, lobed leaves with a distinctive white or pale margin, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by orange-red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a desirable and sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
