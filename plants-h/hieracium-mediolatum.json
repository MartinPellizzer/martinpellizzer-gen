    "intro": "Hieracium mediolatum, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it has a hairy stem that helps it retain moisture. Hieracium mediolatum is generally a short-lived perennial, though it can persist for several years in suitable conditions."
