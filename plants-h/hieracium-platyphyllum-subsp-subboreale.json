    "intro": "Hieracium platyphyllum subsp. subboreale, commonly known as the northern flatleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to northern regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. It has a fibrous root system and is characterized by its relatively small stature, usually reaching heights of up to 30 cm. Due to its adaptability, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and horticultural settings."
