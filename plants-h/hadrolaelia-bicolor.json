    "intro": "Hadrolaelia bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its distinctive bicoloration, with white and purple petals that create a striking visual contrast. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often appearing in late summer or early autumn. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hadrolaelia bicolor is considered a delicate and endangered species."
