    "intro": "Hutchinsia petraea subsp. procumbens, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of Australia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous prostrate stems that root at the nodes. The leaves are linear and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Its small, pale yellow flowers are borne in clusters and bloom during the cooler months. This subspecies is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland desert environments."
