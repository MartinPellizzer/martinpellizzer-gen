    "intro": "Habenaria woodii, commonly known as the Wood's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and delicate, greenish-white flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires well-drained soil. It produces small, oval-shaped pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many states."
