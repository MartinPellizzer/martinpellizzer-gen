    "intro": "Hieracium venascanum, commonly known as the Venetian hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in a composite head. The plant is native to southern Europe and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. It has a taproot system and can spread through both vegetative growth and seed dispersal. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in some regions."
