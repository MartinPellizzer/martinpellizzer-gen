    "intro": "Helianthus annuus var. revolutus, commonly known as the curledleaf sunflower, is a variant of the common sunflower characterized by its distinctive, tightly curled leaves. This variety is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces large, yellow flower heads that follow the sun's movement, a trait known as heliotropism. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. The curledleaf sunflower is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
