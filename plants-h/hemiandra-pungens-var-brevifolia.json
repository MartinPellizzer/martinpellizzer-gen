    "intro": "Hemiandra pungens var. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hemiandra, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces woody capsules containing numerous small seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
