    "intro": "Hylocereus plumieri, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a climbing cactus native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and large, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are often consumed by wildlife and humans alike. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and they emit a sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. Hylocereus plumieri is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
