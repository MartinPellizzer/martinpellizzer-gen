It features fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically green with white or pale markings, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its low maintenance requirements. Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in dry conditions make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
