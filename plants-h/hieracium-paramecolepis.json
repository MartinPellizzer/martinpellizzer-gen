    "intro": "Hieracium paramecolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
