    "intro": "Hardwickia mopane, commonly known as mopane, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, often twisted trunk and its compound leaves that are alternate and pinnate. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody pods containing flat, edible seeds. Mopane is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in regions with low rainfall. Its wood is valued for its durability and is used in construction and furniture-making."
