    "intro": "Hordeum vulgare var. nudijaponicum, commonly known as Japanese barley, is a variant of barley that exhibits distinct botanical characteristics. It is a herbaceous annual plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae, characterized by its slender stems and elongated, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows to a height of 50\u2013100 cm and produces small, two-lobed grains that are less developed compared to typical barley. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a rough texture, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. This variety is often cultivated for its unique grain morphology and is used in both culinary and traditional medicinal applications."
