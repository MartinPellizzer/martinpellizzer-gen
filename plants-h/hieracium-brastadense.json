It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typically showy blooms. The plant features basal rosettes of leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in grassy areas and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally significant species in its native range."
