    "intro": "Hydnophytum dauloense, commonly known as the Dauloense mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees in tropical rainforests. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis using modified leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that feed on its fleshy, red berries. Due to its specialized ecological role, it is considered an important component of forest biodiversity."
