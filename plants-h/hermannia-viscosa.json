    "intro": "Hermannia viscosa, commonly known as sticky hermannia, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often clustered in dense inflorescences. Hermannia viscosa is a low-growing perennial shrub, often found in rocky or disturbed habitats. Its sticky secretions on the leaves serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
