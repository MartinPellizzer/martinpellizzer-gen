    "intro": "Hypericum trigonum, commonly known as three-angled St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are arranged in a distinctive three-angled pattern. The plant is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in sunny to partially shaded environments. It has been historically used in herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antidepressant properties. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover."
