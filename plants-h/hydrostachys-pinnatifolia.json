    "intro": "Hydrostachys pinnatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved watergrass, is a perennial aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged or floating. Its rhizomes help stabilize sediment and improve water quality by filtering pollutants. Hydrostachys pinnatifolia is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to prevent erosion and support aquatic biodiversity."
