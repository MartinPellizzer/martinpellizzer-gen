    "intro": "Hypericum elodes f. terrestre, commonly known as the terrestrial St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland environments. It features small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has opposite, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating in water, adapting to its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. Its stems are typically reddish and can form dense mats in shallow water or moist soil. The species is closely related to other Hypericum species but is distinguished by its terrestrial growth form and specific floral characteristics."
