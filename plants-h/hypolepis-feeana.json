It is characterized by its distinctive, sword-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a subtle golden hue. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense clumps. Its fronds are bi-lobed, with a prominent midrib and serrated margins. Hypolepis feeana thrives in humid, shady environments and is often used as an ornamental plant in gardens and indoor settings."
