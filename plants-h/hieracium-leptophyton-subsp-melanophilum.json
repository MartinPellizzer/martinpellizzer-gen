    "intro": "Hieracium leptophyton subsp. melanophilum, commonly known as the black-leaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dark green, sometimes almost black, foliage. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
