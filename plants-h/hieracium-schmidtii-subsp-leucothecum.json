    "intro": "Hieracium schmidtii subsp. leucothecum, commonly known as the white-capped hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, with the outer flowers being sterile and white, giving it its common name. It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
