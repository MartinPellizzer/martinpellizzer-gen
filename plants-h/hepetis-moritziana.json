    "intro": "Hepetis moritziana, commonly known as the Moritz's gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soil and full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Hepetis moritziana is a perennial herb that plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
