    "intro": "Hakea fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser's hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It features dense, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces cylindrical, yellowish-green flower spikes that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and ability to thrive in poor soils make it a resilient species in coastal and sandy environments. Hakea fraseri is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native gardens."
