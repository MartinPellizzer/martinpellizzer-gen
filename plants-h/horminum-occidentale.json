    "intro": "Horminum occidentale, commonly known as the Western Hormin, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and clusters of small, pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps to reduce water loss. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, Horminum occidentale is now considered endangered and is protected in several European countries."
