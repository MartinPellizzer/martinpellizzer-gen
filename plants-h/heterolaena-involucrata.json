It is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and sometimes hairy, while its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white in color. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native environment, providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
