    "intro": "Helictotrichon pubescens subsp. anatolicum, commonly known as Anatolian bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and dense growth habit, which makes it well-suited for rocky and dry soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in open habitats such as slopes and meadows, where it contributes to soil stabilization. Botanically, it is notable for its hairy leaves and distinctive floral structure typical of the Poaceae family."
