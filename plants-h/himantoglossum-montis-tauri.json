    "intro": "Himantoglossum montis-tauri, commonly known as the Taurus mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the Taurus Mountains of Turkey. It is a terrestrial herb with a tall, slender stem and a single, showy flower that typically blooms in late spring. The plant has a specialized root system adapted to the rocky and nutrient-poor soils of its mountainous habitat. Its flowers are usually purple or violet in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
