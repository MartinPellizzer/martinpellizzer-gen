    "intro": "Haplanthus verticillaris, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant features whorled leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. Its root system is adapted for anchoring in muddy substrates and absorbing nutrients from the water. Haplanthus verticillaris is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and is often found in still or gently flowing water bodies."
