    "intro": "Helichrysum virgineum, commonly known as the common everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, bright yellow to orange flowers that resemble daisies. The plant produces dense clusters of tiny, tubular flowers that are often surrounded by white or pale yellow ray florets. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Helichrysum virgineum is known for its long-lasting flowers, which retain their color and form even after drying, making it popular in floral arrangements."
