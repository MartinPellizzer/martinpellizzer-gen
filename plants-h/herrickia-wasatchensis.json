    "intro": "Herrickia wasatchensis, commonly known as the Wasatch Herrickia, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
