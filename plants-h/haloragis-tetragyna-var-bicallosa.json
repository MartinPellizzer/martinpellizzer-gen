    "intro": "Haloragis tetragyna var. bicallosa, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline and coastal environments. It features small, ovate leaves with a waxy coating that reduces water loss and salt accumulation. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its root system is extensive, helping to stabilize sandy or salty soils. This variant is particularly resilient to high salinity and wind exposure, making it a valuable plant for coastal rehabilitation projects."
