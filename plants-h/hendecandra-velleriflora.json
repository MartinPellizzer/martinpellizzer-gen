    "intro": "Hendecandra velleriflora, commonly known as the hairy-flowered pandanus, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy bracts that surround its inflorescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a panicle, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its tropical habitat. Hendecandra velleriflora is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline conditions."
