    "intro": "Heteracia szovitsii var. epapposa, commonly known as the Hungarian water clover, is a rare aquatic plant native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern on the water surface. The plant has tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
