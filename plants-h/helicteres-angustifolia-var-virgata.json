It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spiny fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
