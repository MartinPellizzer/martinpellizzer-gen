    "intro": "Hechtia tehuacana, commonly known as the Huastec hechtia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to Mexico, particularly the states of Hidalgo and Puebla, where it grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white or grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically red or orange, emerging from the center of the rosette and adding a striking visual contrast to the foliage. Hechtia tehuacana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
