    "intro": "Humboltia pilifera, commonly known as the hairy pilose shrub, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in soft, hairy foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slight waxy coating, aiding in moisture retention. Humboltia pilifera plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and provides habitat for various insects and small animals."
