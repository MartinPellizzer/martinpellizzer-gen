    "intro": "Hydrocotyle himalaica subsp. mukherjeeana, commonly known as the Himalayan water shield, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating on water surfaces. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, which are typically borne in umbels. It thrives in moist, aquatic or semi-aquatic environments and is often found in mountain streams and ponds. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
