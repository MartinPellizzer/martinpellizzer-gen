    "intro": "Hymenophyllum dicranotrichum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf toothed moss, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a narrow, linear shape and a serrated margin, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in moist, shaded forest floors. Hymenophyllum dicranotrichum is notable for its intricate spore-producing structures, which are typically located on the underside of its fronds."
