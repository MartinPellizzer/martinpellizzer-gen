    "intro": "Hippeastrum biflorum, commonly known as the two-flowered amaryllis, is a striking bulbous plant native to South America. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of red, white, and pink, typically during the winter months. The plant has fleshy, strap-like leaves that emerge from a bulb and are often used for propagation. Its flowering period is followed by a dormant phase, during which the bulb stores energy for the next growing season. Hippeastrum biflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in warm, well-drained soils."
