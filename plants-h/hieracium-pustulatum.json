    "intro": "Hieracium pustulatum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its yellowish-green flowers and is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are rough and hairy, with a distinctive pustular appearance on the underside. Hieracium pustulatum is an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production."
