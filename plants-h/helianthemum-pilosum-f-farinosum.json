    "intro": "Helianthemum pilosum f. farinosum, commonly known as the farinose sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming succulent plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features dense, woolly foliage that is covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to sunny, arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
