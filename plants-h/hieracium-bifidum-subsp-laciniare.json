    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. laciniare, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are deeply lobed or dissected, giving it a feathery appearance, and it produces small yellow flowers in late summer. It is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
