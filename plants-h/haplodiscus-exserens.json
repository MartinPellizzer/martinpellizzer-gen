    "intro": "Haplodiscus exserens, commonly known as the golden rain tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and composed of several pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are arranged in panicle-like clusters, often appearing before the leaves in early spring. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Haplodiscus exserens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
