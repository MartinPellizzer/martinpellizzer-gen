    "intro": "Helmiopsiella ctenostegia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of light conditions. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
