    "intro": "Helianthemum rubellum var. nummulariifolium, commonly known as the coppery sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, pinkish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving them a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or rocky habitats. Due to its compact growth and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
