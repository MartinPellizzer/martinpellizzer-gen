    "intro": "Hieracium leucophaeum subsp. pollinense, commonly known as the white-haired hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow disc flowers surrounded by pale yellow to white ray florets, which are typical of the genus Hieracium. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
