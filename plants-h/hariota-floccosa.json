    "intro": "Hariota floccosa, commonly known as the fluffball lichen, is a member of the family Parmeliaceae. It is a foliose lichen, characterized by its leaf-like thallus that is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a cyanobacterium and a fungus, which allows it to thrive in harsh environments. It is often found growing on rocks or tree bark in temperate regions. Its unique appearance, with a fluffy texture, makes it easily identifiable in its natural habitat."
