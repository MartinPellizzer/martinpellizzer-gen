    "intro": "Hypobathrum hoaense, commonly known as the Hoaense Pteridium, is a fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
