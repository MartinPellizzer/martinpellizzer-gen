    "intro": "Heliotropium biannulatiforme, commonly known as the two-annual heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows as an annual or biennial herb, often reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the stems are often hairy, which helps in reducing water loss in arid environments. Heliotropium biannulatiforme is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
