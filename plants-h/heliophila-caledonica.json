It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and typically grows in moist, acidic soils in heathland and moorland environments. The plant features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer.
