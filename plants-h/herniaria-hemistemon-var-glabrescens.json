    "intro": "Herniaria hemistemon var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dunes. This variety is distinguished by its glabrous (smooth) appearance, particularly on the stems and leaves, giving it its common name."
