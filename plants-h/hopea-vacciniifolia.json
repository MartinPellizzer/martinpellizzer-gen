    "intro": "Hopea vacciniifolia, commonly known as the red ironwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The tree has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Hopea vacciniifolia is often found in lowland and hill forest ecosystems, where it plays an important role in the local biodiversity."
