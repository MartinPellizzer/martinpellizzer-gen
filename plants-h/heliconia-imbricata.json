    "intro": "Heliconia imbricata, commonly known as the red heliconia, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its striking, spiral-shaped inflorescence composed of brightly colored bracts that resemble petals. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered within the bracts, which are often used in floral arrangements. Heliconia imbricata thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in rainforests or near water bodies. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
