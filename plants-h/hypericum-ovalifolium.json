It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in the summer. The leaves are oval-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. It is also noted for its medicinal properties, though it contains compounds that can be toxic if ingested."
