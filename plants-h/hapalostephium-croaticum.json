    "intro": "Hapalostephium croaticum, commonly known as the Croatian steppe grass, is a flowering plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green or pale brown in color. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and steppe environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
