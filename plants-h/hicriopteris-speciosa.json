    "intro": "Hicriopteris speciosa, commonly known as the ornamental water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that float on the water surface, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often used in ornamental ponds and water gardens. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, typical of the fern family. Hicriopteris speciosa is valued for its aesthetic appeal and ability to improve water quality by absorbing nutrients."
