    "intro": "Heliotropium samoliflorum subsp. erzurumicum, commonly known as the Erzurum heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Turkey. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces violet-colored blooms that open in response to sunlight, a trait known as heliotropism. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
