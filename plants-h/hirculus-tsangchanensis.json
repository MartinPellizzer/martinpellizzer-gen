    "intro": "Hirculus tsangchanensis, commonly known as the Tibetan goat-antelope, is a unique plant species found in the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It is characterized by its small, compact size and thick, hairy leaves that help it withstand harsh climatic conditions. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to access water from underground sources. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
