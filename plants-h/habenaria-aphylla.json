    "intro": "Habenaria aphylla, commonly known as the leafless orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its green, fleshy stems. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized orchid species."
