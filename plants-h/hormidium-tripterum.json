    "intro": "Hormidium tripterum, commonly known as the three-winged bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are simple and often clustered at the base, with specialized structures for capturing prey. Hormidium tripterum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to the food web and maintaining water quality."
