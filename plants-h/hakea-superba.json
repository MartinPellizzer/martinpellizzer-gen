    "intro": "Hakea superba, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is an evergreen shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its cylindrical, woody stems and dense clusters of narrow, needle-like leaves. The plant produces striking, bottlebrush-like inflorescences that range in color from white to pink, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salt exposure. Hakea superba is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
