    "intro": "Haworthia fasciata f. variabilis, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves with distinctive white to light green stripes, giving it a zebra-like appearance. The leaves are typically a dark green to blue-gray color, with contrasting markings that vary in width and intensity. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers on tall, branched stems during the summer months. This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
