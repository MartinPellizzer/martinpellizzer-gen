    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 bifurcum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, including North America, where it often invades disturbed soils and open habitats. It is a hybrid species, resulting from the cross between Hieracium piloselloides and Hieracium auripigmentum. Due to its aggressive growth and ability to form dense stands, it is considered a weed in many areas."
