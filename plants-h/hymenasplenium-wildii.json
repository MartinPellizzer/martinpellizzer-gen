    "intro": "Hymenasplenium wildii, commonly known as the wild spleenwort, is a member of the family Pteridaceae and is a small, terrestrial fern. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of moss-like growth. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Hymenasplenium wildii is characterized by its simple yet elegant morphology, making it a common sight in temperate regions."
