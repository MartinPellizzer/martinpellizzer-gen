    "intro": "Hieracium multicaulis, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and multiple flowering stems that rise from the center. The plant produces small, yellow-orange composite flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is typically found in moist meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks in temperate regions. Hieracium multicaulis is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
