    "intro": "Hormathophylla spinosa, commonly known as the spiny leaf fern, is a unique plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread across forest floors, often forming dense mats. Its leaves are usually leathery and have a dark green color with a waxy surface. Hormathophylla spinosa is often found in shaded, humid environments, thriving in the understory of tropical rainforests."
