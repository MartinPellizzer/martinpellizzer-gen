    "intro": "Hypericum pedersenii, commonly known as the Pedersen's St. John's Wort, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has opposite, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Like other members of the Hypericaceae family, it contains bioactive compounds, though it is not widely cultivated for medicinal purposes."
