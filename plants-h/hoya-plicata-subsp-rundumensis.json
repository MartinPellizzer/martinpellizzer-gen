    "intro": "Hoya plicata subsp. rundumensis, commonly known as the \"Coral Hoya,\" is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late winter or early spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hoya plicata subsp. rundumensis is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance."
