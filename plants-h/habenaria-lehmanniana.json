    "intro": "Habenaria lehmanniana, commonly known as the Lehmann's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are strap-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture. Like many orchids, it has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake."
