    "intro": "Helianthemum ledifolium var. glaberrimum, commonly known as the glabrous rockrose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, fleshy, gray-green leaves that are densely packed and covered in a waxy cuticle, helping to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during spring, adding a bright contrast to its foliage. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland scrublands. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens with full sun exposure."
