    "intro": "Holodiscus microphyllus var. sericeus, commonly known as the silverleaf holly. It is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are densely covered in fine, silvery hairs. The leaves are typically elliptical or ovate in shape and have a glossy, waxy appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. This plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
