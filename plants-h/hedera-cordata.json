    "intro": "Hedera cordata, commonly known as the ivy-leaved ivy, is a species of flowering plant in the Araliaceae family. It is native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa, and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. Hedera cordata is often grown as a climbing or trailing plant in gardens and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments. It is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
