    "intro": "Helichrysum benthamii, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers that resemble miniature sunflowers. The plant produces papery, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to thrive in arid and rocky environments. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Helichrysum benthamii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
