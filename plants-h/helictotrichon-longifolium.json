    "intro": "Helictotrichon longifolium, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is native to North America and thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. Helictotrichon longifolium is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and its value as a forage plant."
