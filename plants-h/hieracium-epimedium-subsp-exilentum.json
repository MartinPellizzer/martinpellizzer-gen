    "intro": "Hieracium epimedium subsp. exilentum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils in meadows and woodland edges. The plant features a low-growing habit with reddish stems and basal leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate in shape. Its flowers are yellow, clustered in loose inflorescences, and bloom from late spring to early summer. It is often considered a weed in agricultural and garden settings due to its aggressive spreading habit."
