    "intro": "Heteropogon oliganthus, commonly known as the narrowleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, grassy habitats and is adapted to dry or semi-arid conditions. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and narrow, linear leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Heteropogon oliganthus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soils."
