It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers on tall, slender stems during the growing season. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for indoor cultivation. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
