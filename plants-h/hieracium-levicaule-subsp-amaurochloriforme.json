    "intro": "Hieracium levicaule subsp. amaurochloriforme, commonly known as the pale-yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering heads that produce small, yellowish to pale-green composite flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a slightly rough texture, while the flowers are arranged in a dense cluster at the top of the stem. This subspecies is distinguished by its pale coloration and compact growth habit, making it a subtle yet distinctive member of the hawkweed genus."
