    "intro": "Helonias koreana, commonly known as the Korean marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of Korea. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, spike-like inflorescence bearing small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow, marshy areas and thrives in humid, nutrient-poor environments. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding wetland substrate. Helonias koreana is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
