    "intro": "Hieracium nigrescens subsp. tanense, commonly known as the Tanese hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering heads that produce small, yellowish composite flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, while its stems are upright and often branched. The subspecies tanense is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and flowering behavior compared to other members of the species."
