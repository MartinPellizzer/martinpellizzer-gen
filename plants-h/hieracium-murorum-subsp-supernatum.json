    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. supernatum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellowish to reddish composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, including variations in leaf shape and flower structure. It is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands, where it contributes to the biodiversity of alpine ecosystems."
