    "intro": "Hieracium euboeum, commonly known as the Euboean hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found on the island of Euboea. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are lance-shaped with rough, hairy surfaces. Hieracium euboeum is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
