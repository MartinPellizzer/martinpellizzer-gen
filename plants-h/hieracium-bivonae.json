    "intro": "Hieracium bivonae, commonly known as the Bivona hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disc. Hieracium bivonae is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize new areas quickly."
