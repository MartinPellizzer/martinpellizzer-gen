    "intro": "Heteranthera limosa var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and slightly curved, adapted for waterlogged conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in marshy areas. It is often found in swamps, pond margins, and other moist habitats."
