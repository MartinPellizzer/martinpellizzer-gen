    "intro": "Hekorima candida, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, white, waxy flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often covered in a fine, silvery bloom that gives it its common name. Hekorima candida is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its traditional use in local medicine."
