    "intro": "Hevea paludosa, commonly known as the swamp rubber tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often buttressed trunk and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant thrives in wet, swampy environments and is adapted to waterlogged soils. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects. The latex it secretes has been historically used in the production of natural rubber, though it is not as economically significant as other Hevea species."
