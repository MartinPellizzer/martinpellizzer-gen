    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 spathulifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a hybrid plant species belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its large, broad, and often lobed leaves, which are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces yellow flowering heads composed of numerous small florets, which are surrounded by bracts. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, where it can become invasive in certain habitats. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
