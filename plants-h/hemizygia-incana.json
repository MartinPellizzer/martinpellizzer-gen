    "intro": "Hemizygia incana, commonly known as the silverleaf hemizygia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming during the cooler months. Its root system is deep and drought-tolerant, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. Hemizygia incana is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
