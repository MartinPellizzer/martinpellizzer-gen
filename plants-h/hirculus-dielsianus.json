It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley. The plant is distinguished by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer.

Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
