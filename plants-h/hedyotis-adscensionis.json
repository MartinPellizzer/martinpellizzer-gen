    "intro": "Hedyotis adscensionis, commonly known as the Ascension Island geranium, is a flowering plant native to the remote Ascension Island in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky coastal areas and open grasslands. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers with five petals, which bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to the island's harsh climate. Hedyotis adscensionis is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique evolutionary adaptations and limited geographic distribution."
