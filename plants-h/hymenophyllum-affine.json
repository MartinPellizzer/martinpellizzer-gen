    "intro": "Hymenophyllum affine, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spore moss, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate, and often creeping growth habit, with leaves that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sorus, are borne on the underside of the leaves and contain spores. Hymenophyllum affine is notable for its intricate leaf anatomy, which includes a complex arrangement of cells that aid in water retention and light absorption."
