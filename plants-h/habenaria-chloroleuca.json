    "intro": "Habenaria chloroleuca, commonly known as the green-veined orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers with prominent yellow veins, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in the dappled light. Its rhizomes are fibrous, and it produces small, oval-shaped pseudobulbs that support its growth. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
