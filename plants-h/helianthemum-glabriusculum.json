    "intro": "Helianthemum glabriusculum, commonly known as the smooth rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established. Its compact form and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
