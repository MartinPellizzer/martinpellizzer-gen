    "intro": "Helictotrichon sedenense, commonly known as the six-row grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, silky leaves that are often covered in short hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a subject of ecological study."
