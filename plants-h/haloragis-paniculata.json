It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom in spring. It thrives in wet or damp environments, such as marshes and swampy areas. Haloragis paniculata is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils and has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize the soil."
