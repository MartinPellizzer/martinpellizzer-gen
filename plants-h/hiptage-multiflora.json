It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom throughout the year. Its flowers are typically borne on short pedicels, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded environments. Hiptage multiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its continuous flowering."
