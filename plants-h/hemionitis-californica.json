    "intro": "Hemionitis californica, commonly known as the California hemionitis, is a rare and delicate fern native to the coastal regions of California. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal bluffs and rock outcrops. The plant has feathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
