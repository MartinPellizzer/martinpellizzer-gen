    "intro": "Halimium umbellatum var. vulgare, commonly known as the common halimium, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cistaceae. It is a low-growing perennial shrub native to southern Europe, particularly found in rocky and limestone soils. The plant produces clusters of small, showy yellow flowers in early summer, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow, evergreen, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and drought tolerance."
