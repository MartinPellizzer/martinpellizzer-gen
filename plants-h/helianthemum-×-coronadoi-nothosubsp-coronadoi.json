    "intro": "Helianthemum \u00d7 coronadoi nothosubsp. coronadoi, commonly known as the Coronado stonecrop, is a hybrid succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Cactus Family (Cactaceae) and is characterized by its compact, mound-like growth habit. The plant features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. It produces showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
