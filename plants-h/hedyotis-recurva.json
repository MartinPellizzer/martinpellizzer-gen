    "intro": "Hedyotis recurva, commonly known as the creeping brake, is a low-growing perennial herb native to various regions of Asia and Africa. It features small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is characterized by its creeping habit, with stems that root at the nodes and spread along the ground. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Hedyotis recurva is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
