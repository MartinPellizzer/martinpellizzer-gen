It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowering heads consist of numerous small florets arranged in a disc-like structure surrounded by pale green to yellow bracts. Hieracium adleptonychum is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions."
