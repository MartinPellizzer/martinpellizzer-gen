    "intro": "Hexocenia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, which are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. Hexocenia is native to Central and South America but has been introduced to other tropical regions. It is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
