    "intro": "Hieracium comasinum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragweed, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soil. Its yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium comasinum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its invasive growth habits."
