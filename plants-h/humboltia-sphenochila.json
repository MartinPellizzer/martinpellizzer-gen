    "intro": "Humboltia sphenochila, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to hot, dry environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a yellow center. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping to conserve water in its harsh habitat. Humboltia sphenochila plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals."
