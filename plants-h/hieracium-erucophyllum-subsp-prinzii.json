It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features basal leaves that are hairy and lobed, with a rosette structure that helps it conserve moisture. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind.
