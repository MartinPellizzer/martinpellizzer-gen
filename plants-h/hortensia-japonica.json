    "intro": "Hortensia japonica, commonly known as the Japanese hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flower clusters that can range in color from blue to pink, depending on soil pH. The plant thrives in partial shade and moist, well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for gardens in temperate climates. Its foliage is typically dark green, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring. Hortensia japonica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to provide seasonal color in landscapes."
