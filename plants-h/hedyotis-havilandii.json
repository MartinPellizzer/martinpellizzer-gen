    "intro": "Hedyotis havilandii, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows on the branches of oak trees, forming dense clusters that can cover large areas of the host canopy. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by tiny, berry-like fruits that contain the seeds. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often covered in fine hairs. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the health of its host trees if left unchecked."
