    "intro": "Helianthemum lippii var. intricatum, commonly known as the intricately branched rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with dense, evergreen foliage. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
