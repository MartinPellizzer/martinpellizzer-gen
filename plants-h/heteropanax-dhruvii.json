    "intro": "Heteropanax dhruvii, commonly known as the Dhruv's heteropanax, is a rare tropical plant belonging to the Araliaceae family. It is native to the dense rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in regions of Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 50 cm in diameter, with a distinctive veining pattern. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by berry-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Heteropanax dhruvii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
