    "intro": "Hymenophyllum stenocladum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf filmy fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, translucent fronds that are often covered in a thin layer of moisture. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in specialized structures called sorus. Hymenophyllum stenocladum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is a popular choice for terrariums and shaded garden settings."
