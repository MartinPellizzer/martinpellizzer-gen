    "intro": "Hoffmannia pauciflora, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a compact rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by fluffy seed heads resembling dandelion seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Hoffmannia pauciflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
