    "intro": "Hieracium nidense, commonly known as the nest hawksbeard, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow composite flowers with ray florets. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Hieracium nidense is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
