    "intro": "Hemionitis hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy hemionitis, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, hairy fronds that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its specific ecological requirements, Hemionitis hirsuta is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
