    "intro": "Hedera squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrose ivy, is a species of climbing plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and its ability to form dense mats on rocky surfaces. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a waxy, glossy surface and can vary in size depending on environmental conditions. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by dark blue berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. This plant is often found in dry, sunny habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
