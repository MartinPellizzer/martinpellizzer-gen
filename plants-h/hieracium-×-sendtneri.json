    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 sendtneri, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a hybrid species within the dandelion family (Compositae). It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is native to Europe. It produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by the wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in many regions."
