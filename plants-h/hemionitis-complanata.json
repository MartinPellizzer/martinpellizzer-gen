    "intro": "Hemionitis complanata, commonly known as the flat leaved hemionitis, is a rare and delicate fern native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its small, closely spaced, and often clustered fronds that form a dense, low-growing mat. The plant has a unique reproductive structure, with sporangia borne on short stalks at the tips of the fronds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a threatened species in many areas."
