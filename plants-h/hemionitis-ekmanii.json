    "intro": "Hemionitis ekmanii, commonly known as the Arctic bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. It has simple, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. Hemionitis ekmanii is adapted to cold climates and can survive in nutrient-poor waters."
