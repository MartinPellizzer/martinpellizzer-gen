It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
