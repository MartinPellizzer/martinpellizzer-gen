    "intro": "Hieracium porrigens, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture. Hieracium porrigens is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can spread rapidly through its rhizomes. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed."
