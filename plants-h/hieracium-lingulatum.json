    "intro": "Hieracium lingulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often narrowed at the base. Its flowers are yellow, with ray florets that are usually shorter than the disk florets, and it produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Hieracium lingulatum is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates."
