    "intro": "Hazunta modesta, commonly known as the modest wildflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the temperate regions of Southeast Asia. It features small, delicate blue-violet flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in its habitat. Hazunta modesta is often found in shaded woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
