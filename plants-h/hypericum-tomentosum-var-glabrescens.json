    "intro": "Hypericum tomentosum var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed St. John's wort, is a low-growing shrub native to Europe. It features woody stems that become smooth with age, distinguishing it from the more hairy stems of the typical variety. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, with a slightly hairy texture when young. It is often used in garden landscapes for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
