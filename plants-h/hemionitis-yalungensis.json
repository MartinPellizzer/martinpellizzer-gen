    "intro": "Hemionitis yalungensis, commonly known as the Yalung grass, is a rare and unique plant native to the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Hemionitidaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-like growth pattern and distinctive, narrow leaves. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cold, arid conditions with limited soil nutrients. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
