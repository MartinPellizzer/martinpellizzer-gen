    "intro": "Hieracium subaurantiacum, commonly known as yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers, which consist of numerous small florets arranged in a flat, disk-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. Hieracium subaurantiacum is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
