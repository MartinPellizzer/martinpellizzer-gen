It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally endemic species."
