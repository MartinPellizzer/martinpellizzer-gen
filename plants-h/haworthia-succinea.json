It features striking, fleshy, triangular leaves with white to yellowish markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant typically produces small, white or pale green flowers on slender stalks during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to maintain its vibrant appearance. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
