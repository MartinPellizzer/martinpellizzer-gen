    "intro": "Hippocratea hilariana, commonly known as the Hilo orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its strikingly beautiful, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on the trunks of trees or in rocky crevices. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the humid air, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
