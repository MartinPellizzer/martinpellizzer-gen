    "intro": "Heteradelphia, commonly known as the \"false indigo,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, where the petals are arranged in a unique pattern with two petals at the base and three above, forming a bilabiate (two-lipped) shape. The leaves are typically pinnately compound, consisting of several small leaflets arranged along a central axis. Heteradelphia species are often found in temperate regions and are known for their attractive blue to purple flowers. These plants are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making them beneficial in ecological and agricultural contexts."
