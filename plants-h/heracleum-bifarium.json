    "intro": "Heracleum bifarium, commonly known as the two-leaved cow parsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. It is a herbaceous perennial plant that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils across temperate regions of North America. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins and a distinctive, hollow stem that is often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbrella-like clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Heracleum bifarium is often mistaken for poison hemlock due to its similar appearance, but it is generally less toxic and can be found in open woodlands and along stream banks."
