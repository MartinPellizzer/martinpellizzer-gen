    "intro": "Hydnophytum buxifolium, commonly known as the wax plant or Indian wax plant, is a hemiepiphytic plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its unique ability to grow on other plants, using them for support while deriving nutrients from the air and rain. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are leathery and glossy, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Hydnophytum buxifolium is native to tropical regions of Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
