    "intro": "Hieracium cardoanum, commonly known as the cardoon hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the daisy family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its rosette of hairy, gray-green leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in a flat-topped cluster. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
