    "intro": "Hippocratea isangiensis, commonly known as the Congo orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically feature vibrant purple and white hues. The plant has a delicate, sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by specific insect species, contributing to its ecological significance in the region. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in protected areas."
