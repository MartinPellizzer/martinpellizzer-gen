It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its bright yellow flowers bloom from June to August, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hieracium phrixozum is often found in open habitats and can spread aggressively through rhizomes, making it both a common weed and a valuable wildflower."
