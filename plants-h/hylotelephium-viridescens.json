    "intro": "Hylotelephium viridescens, commonly known as the green stonecrop, is a perennial succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green, arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces upright stems with clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple during the summer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. Hylotelephium viridescens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils."
