It produces large, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming in late winter or early spring. The plant features strap-like, linear leaves that are broad at the base and taper toward the tips. Its bulbous stem is fleshy and stores water, helping it survive in dry conditions.
