    "intro": "Hemipilia parceflora, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with a sympodial growth habit, characterized by its rhizomes and pseudobulbs. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pale pink to white in color, with a distinctive lip structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
