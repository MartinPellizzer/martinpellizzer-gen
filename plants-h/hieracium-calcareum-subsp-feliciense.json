It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It has lanceolate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky and arid environments."
