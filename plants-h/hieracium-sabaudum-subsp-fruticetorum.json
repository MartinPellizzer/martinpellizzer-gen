    "intro": "Hieracium sabaudum subsp. fruticetorum, commonly known as the shrubby hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along riverbanks. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a hairy surface, and it produces yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its flowering stems are usually shorter than the leaves, and the flowers are surrounded by a series of leaf-like bracts. This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often mistaken for other hawkweed species due to its similar appearance."
