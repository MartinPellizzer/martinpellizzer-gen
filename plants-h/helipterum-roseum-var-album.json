It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread across arid and semi-arid regions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environmental conditions."
