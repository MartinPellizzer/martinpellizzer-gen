    "intro": "Hippocrepis balearica f. granatensis, commonly known as the Granada rock orchid, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the Balearic Islands. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to grow in rocky and limestone-rich soils, often in sunny, well-drained habitats. Its morphology includes slender stems and small, lanceolate leaves, with flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
