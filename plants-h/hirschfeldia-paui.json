    "intro": "Hirschfeldia paui, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a red throat. Hirschfeldia paui is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water, featuring small, waxy leaves to reduce transpiration. It produces capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils."
