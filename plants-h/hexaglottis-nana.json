    "intro": "Hexaglottis nana, commonly known as the dwarf hexaglottis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as swamps and floodplains, where it thrives in moist, organic soils. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers are usually pink or purple in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
