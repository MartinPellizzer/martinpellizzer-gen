    "intro": "Hoya buotii, commonly known as the \"Chinese Wax Plant,\" is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and clusters of waxy, star-shaped flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Hoya buotii prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its slow growth and ornamental foliage make it a favored plant among succulent and tropical plant enthusiasts."
