    "intro": "Hakea juncifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of whitish hair. The plant produces cylindrical, yellow to orange flower spikes that appear in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and adaptability to dry conditions make it a resilient species in its native habitat. Hakea juncifolia is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
