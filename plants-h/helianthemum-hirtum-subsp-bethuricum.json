    "intro": "Helianthemum hirtum subsp. bethuricum, commonly known as the Scottish heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the British Isles. It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
