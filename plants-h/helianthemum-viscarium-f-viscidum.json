    "intro": "Helianthemum viscarium f. viscidum, commonly known as the sticky rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, typically from June to August. The plant has a compact growth habit with dense, glandular hairs that give it a sticky texture. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, sticky pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats."
