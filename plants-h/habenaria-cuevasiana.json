    "intro": "Habenaria cuevasiana, commonly known as the Cueva Orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant grows in humid, shaded environments, often in mountainous or forested areas. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil and air. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
