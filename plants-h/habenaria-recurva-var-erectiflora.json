    "intro": "Habenaria recurva var. erectiflora, commonly known as the erect-flowered marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features a slender, wiry stem with a single, erect, spike-like inflorescence that bears small, pale green to white flowers. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant. The orchid's flowers are pollinated by insects, and it is known for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi."
