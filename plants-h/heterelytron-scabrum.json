    "intro": "Heterelytron scabrum, commonly known as the rough blister beetle, is a species of beetle belonging to the family Meloidae. It is characterized by its dark, often black or reddish body covered with a rough, scaly texture. The plant aspect of this beetle is not applicable, as it is an insect, not a plant. However, it is often found in association with certain plants, particularly those in the family Fabaceae. Its presence can sometimes indicate the health or condition of the surrounding vegetation."
