    "intro": "Heliophila clavuligera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heliophyte, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white or pale blue flowers bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to meadows and wetlands. Heliophila clavuligera is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators in natural habitats."
