    "intro": "Hillia tuxtlensis, commonly known as the Tuxtlans mountain orchid, is a flowering plant native to the humid forests of southern Mexico. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stem and clustered flowers. The plant typically grows at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters, thriving in shaded, moist environments. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinctive shape that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
