    "intro": "Hieracium valirense, commonly known as the Italian hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. It produces yellow ray florets surrounded by tubular disc florets, which are adapted for pollination by insects. Hieracium valirense is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its invasive growth habit."
