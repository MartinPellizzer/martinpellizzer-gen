    "intro": "Hemizonia luzulifolia, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and striking blue-violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.
