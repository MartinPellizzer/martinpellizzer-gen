    "intro": "Habenaria replicata, commonly known as the common ghost orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Africa, including Kenya and Tanzania. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its striking, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories or on rocky outcrops. Its reproductive system relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is essential for its survival. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered threatened in some regions."
