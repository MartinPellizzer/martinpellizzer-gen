    "intro": "Heliotropium hasslerianum, commonly known as the sticky heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, and its flowers open in response to sunlight, a trait known as heliotropism. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. The sticky secretions on its leaves and stems may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
