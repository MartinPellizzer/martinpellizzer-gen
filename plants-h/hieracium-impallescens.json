    "intro": "Hieracium impallescens, commonly known as the pale hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often have a grayish or whitish coating, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The flowers are yellow, with ray florets that are usually shorter than the central disk florets, and the plant produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal."
