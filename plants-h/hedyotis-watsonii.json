    "intro": "Hedyotis watsonii, commonly known as the Watson's spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of East Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of tiny yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its stems are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse its seeds. Hedyotis watsonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
