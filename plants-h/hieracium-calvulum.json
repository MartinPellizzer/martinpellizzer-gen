    "intro": "Hieracium calvulum, commonly known as the smooth hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its flowers are yellow, with ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, and it produces small, dry achenes as its seeds. Hieracium calvulum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can form dense colonies due to its aggressive growth habit."
