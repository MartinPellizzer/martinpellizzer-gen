    "intro": "Hydrocotyle trachycarpa, commonly known as the roughleaf water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has floating leaves that are round and covered with tiny, rough-textured hairs, which give it its common name. Its small white flowers bloom in late summer, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by water. Hydrocotyle trachycarpa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
