    "intro": "Henriettea martii var. orinocensis, commonly known as the Orinoco henriettea, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Orinoco River basin in South America. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in humid tropical forests. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and restricted distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status remains uncertain."
