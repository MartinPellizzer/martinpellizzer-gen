    "intro": "Huperzia riobambensis, commonly known as the Rio Bamb\u00e9 fern, is a tropical fern native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, often clustered fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Huperzia riobambensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
