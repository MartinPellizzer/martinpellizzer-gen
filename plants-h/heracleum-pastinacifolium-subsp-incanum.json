    "intro": "Heracleum pastinacifolium subsp. incanum, commonly known as the hairy cow parsnip, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, palmately lobed leaves that are covered in fine, hairy textures. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Due to its resemblance to toxic plants like poison hemlock, it requires careful identification to avoid misidentification."
