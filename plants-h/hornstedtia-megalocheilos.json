    "intro": "Hornstedtia megalocheilos, commonly known as the giant-horned orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the Andes Mountains of South America. This terrestrial orchid is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter, with a distinctive horn-like spur. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the thin soil. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
