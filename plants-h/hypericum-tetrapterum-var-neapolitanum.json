    "intro": "Hypericum tetrapterum var. neapolitanum, commonly known as the Naples St. John's Wort, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense, low-growing clumps over time."
