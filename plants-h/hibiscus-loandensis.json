    "intro": "Hibiscus loandensis, commonly known as the Loando hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its flowers bloom during the rainy season. Hibiscus loandensis is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
