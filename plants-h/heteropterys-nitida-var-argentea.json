    "intro": "Heteropterys nitida var. argentea, commonly known as silverleaf huito, is a variant of the evergreen shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant has ovate to lanceolate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
