    "intro": "Hieracium holophyes, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and the plant produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Hieracium holophyes is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
