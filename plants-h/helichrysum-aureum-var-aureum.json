    "intro": "Helichrysum aureum var. aureum, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, golden-yellow flowers that resemble tiny suns. The plant produces papery, dry flower heads that retain their color and form even after drying, making it popular in dried floral arrangements. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or sandy environments. The species is also valued for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
