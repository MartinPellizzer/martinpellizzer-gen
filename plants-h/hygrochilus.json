    "intro": "Hygrochilus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves and striking, delicate flowers that often appear without visible stems. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Hygrochilus thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in many areas."
