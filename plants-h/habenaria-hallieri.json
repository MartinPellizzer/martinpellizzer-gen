    "intro": "Habenaria hallieri, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and its distinctive inflorescence of pink or white flowers arranged in a loose, spreading raceme. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its flowers are spurred at the base, a feature common in many orchid species, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Habenaria hallieri is known for its delicate appearance and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
