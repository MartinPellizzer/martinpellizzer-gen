It is characterized by its square stems and small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and its roots are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Hedyotis quadrangularis is also known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a persistent weed and a valuable medicinal plant."
