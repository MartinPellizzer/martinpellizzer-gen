    "intro": "Habenaria marupaana, commonly known as the Marupaan orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, greenish-yellow or white flowers arranged in a raceme, often with a distinct lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
