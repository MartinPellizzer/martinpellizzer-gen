It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Hedysarum frutescens is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites."
