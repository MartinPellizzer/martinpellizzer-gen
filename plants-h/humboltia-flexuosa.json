    "intro": "Humboltia flexuosa, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of South America. It is a climbing vine with heart-shaped, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet, typically blooming in the morning. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline, where it often grows in dense thickets. Humboltia flexuosa is adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
