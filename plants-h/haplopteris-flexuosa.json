    "intro": "Haplopteris flexuosa, commonly known as the wavy maidenhair fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that exhibit a wavy or undulating pattern along their margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Haplopteris flexuosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
