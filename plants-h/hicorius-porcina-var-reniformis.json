    "intro": "Hicorius porcina var. reniformis, commonly known as the broadleaf hedgehog mushroom, is a variant of the hedgehog mushroom species. It is characterized by its distinctive, irregularly shaped cap that often has a broad, kidney-like appearance. The cap is typically covered with small, spine-like projections, giving it a unique texture. The gills are attached to the stem and are initially pale but darken with age. This variant is often found in association with certain tree species, particularly oaks, in forested areas."
