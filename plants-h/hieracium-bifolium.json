    "intro": "Hieracium bifolium, commonly known as the two-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. It has basal leaves that are usually heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, with the upper leaves being smaller and more upright. The flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer, producing small seeds that are dispersed by the wind."
