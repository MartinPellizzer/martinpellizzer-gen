    "intro": "Hermodactylus tuberosus, commonly known as the mountain potato or Andean tuber, is a perennial herb native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its tuberous roots that store nutrients. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a hairy texture, while its flowers are small and usually white or pale purple. The tubers are edible when properly prepared and have been used by indigenous peoples for centuries."
