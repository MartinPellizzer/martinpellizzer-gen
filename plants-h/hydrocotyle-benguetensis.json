    "intro": "Hydrocotyle benguetensis, commonly known as the Benguet water shield, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, floating leaves that are typically divided into lobes. The plant thrives in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes, where it can anchor itself with its rhizomes. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom during the warmer months. Hydrocotyle benguetensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
