    "intro": "Hieracium erythrocarpum subsp. hypopoliocranum, commonly known as the red-fruited hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow to orange composite flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller, more compact inflorescence and shorter, more upright leaves compared to other members of the species. Its fruits are typically red or orange, which gives it its common name. This plant thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands."
