    "intro": "Hieracium neophlomoides, commonly known as the false hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands, and it produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture, while its stems are often reddish or purplish in color. Hieracium neophlomoides is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
