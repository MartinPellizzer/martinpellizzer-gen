    "intro": "Hedysarum rosmarinifolium, commonly known as sweet clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its fern-like, aromatic leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa but has been introduced to other regions. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and fixes nitrogen, enriching the soil. Sweet clover is often used in forage and as a cover crop due to its hardy nature and ecological benefits."
