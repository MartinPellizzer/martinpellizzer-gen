    "intro": "Hemionitis fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser's hemionitis, is a rare and specialized fern native to the arid regions of western North America. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to extreme environmental conditions. The plant has a distinctive, compact growth form with small, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. It reproduces through spores, which are released from the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Hemionitis fraseri is considered a sensitive indicator of ecological health in its native environment."
