    "intro": "Hyoscyamus bohemicus var. pallidus, commonly known as the pale thornapple, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Central Europe. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range from white to pale yellow. The plant produces spiny fruits that contain toxic seeds, making it a potentially dangerous species. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by livestock and humans alike."
