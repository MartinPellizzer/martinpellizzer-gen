    "intro": "Homalium digynum, commonly known as the two-seed tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Mexico and Brazil. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release two seeds, hence the common name. Homalium digynum is often found in lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological importance."
