    "intro": "Hieronyma nipensis, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in certain regions."
