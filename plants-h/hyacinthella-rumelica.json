    "intro": "Hyacinthella rumelica, commonly known as the Balkan hyacinth, is a flowering plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of narrow, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
