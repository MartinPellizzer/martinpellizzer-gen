It is characterized by its compact growth habit and reduced leaf size compared to the typical species. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, typical of the Hypericaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or disturbed habitats. This form is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological traits and potential ecological adaptations."
