It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces showy yellow to orange composite flowers. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential weed in some environments."
