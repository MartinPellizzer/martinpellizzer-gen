    "intro": "Hoya caudata var. crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leaved wax plant, is a compact, trailing evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features thick, waxy, ovate leaves that are often variegated with white or cream markings. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink, typically blooming during the summer months. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal. Hoya caudata var. crassifolia thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
