    "intro": "Herniaria cachemiriana, commonly known as the Kashmir carnation, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Himalayan regions. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of pink or white flowers with five petals, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
