    "intro": "Hydranthus, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants that belongs to the family Nychthemeral. These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers that open during the day and close at night. Hydranthus species typically have roots that anchor them in shallow water, while their leaves provide a surface for photosynthesis. The flowers are usually pink, white, or yellow, and they attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hydranthus plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water bodies."
