It is characterized by its small, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically green with white or yellow markings. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy leaves. It produces small, white flowers on slender stems during the warmer months. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
