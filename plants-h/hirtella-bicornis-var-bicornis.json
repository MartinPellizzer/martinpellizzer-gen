    "intro": "Hirtella bicornis var. bicornis, commonly known as the two-horned hirtella, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, appressed hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species within its native range."
