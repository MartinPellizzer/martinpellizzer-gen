    "intro": "Heliotropium pinnatisectum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, pinnatisected leaves that give it a finely divided appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, often with a distinctive white or pale center. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Heliotropium pinnatisectum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
