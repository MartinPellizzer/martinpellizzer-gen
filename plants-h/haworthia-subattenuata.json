    "intro": "Haworthia subattenuata, commonly known as the Zulu Thorn or Zulu bulb, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, light green leaves with a waxy coating that helps it store water. The leaves are often adorned with white or pale green markings, giving it a striking appearance. It produces small, white, star-shaped flowers on tall, slender stems during the summer months. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water, making it an ideal choice for low-maintenance gardening."
