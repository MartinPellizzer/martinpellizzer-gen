    "intro": "Heteropterys mollis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds.
