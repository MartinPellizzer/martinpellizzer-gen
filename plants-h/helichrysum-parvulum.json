    "intro": "Helichrysum parvulum, commonly known as the small everlasting or dwarf immortelle, is a small, mat-forming shrub native to South Africa. It produces bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and is characterized by its compact growth habit. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Helichrysum parvulum is also valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
