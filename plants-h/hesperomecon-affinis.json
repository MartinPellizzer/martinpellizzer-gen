    "intro": "Hesperomecon affinis, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria. Hesperomecon affinis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
