    "intro": "Haworthia turgida var. longibracteata, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to South Africa. It features striking, translucent, zebra-like markings on its fleshy, blue-green leaves, which are covered in white tubercles. The plant produces tall, slender stems with clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the growing season. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
