    "intro": "Hieracium incanum subsp. semicaulescens, commonly known as the silky hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, and it produces yellow composite flowers in clusters. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread vegetatively. Due to its ornamental value and invasive tendencies in some regions, it is sometimes cultivated or considered a weed."
