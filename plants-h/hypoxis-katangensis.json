It belongs to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae and is characterized by its star-shaped yellow flowers. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
