    "intro": "Harrera, commonly known as the \"blue henna\" or \"henna tree,\" is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that contain a yellowish pulp and a single seed. Harrera is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its ability to thrive in arid conditions makes it well-suited for xeriscaping in dry climates."
