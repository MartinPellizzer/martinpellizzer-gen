    "intro": "Helicia obovata var. minor, commonly known as the small-leafed helicia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Theaceae and is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically smaller than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
