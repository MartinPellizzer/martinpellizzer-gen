    "intro": "Helictotrichon lusitanicum, commonly known as the Lusitanian bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and compact growth habit, typically forming dense mats or low-growing clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
