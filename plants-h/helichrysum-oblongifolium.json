    "intro": "Helichrysum oblongifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, bright yellow to orange flowers that are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. It is drought-tolerant and prefers full sun, which contributes to its hardy and low-maintenance nature. Helichrysum oblongifolium is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
