    "intro": "Helianthemum apenninum subsp. lazarei, commonly known as the Sicilian sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in southern regions."
