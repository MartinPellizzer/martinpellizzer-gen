    "intro": "Hymenorebutia aurea var. callochrysea, commonly known as the golden chrysalis cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to the arid regions of Argentina. It is a low-growing, solitary cactus with a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white to pale yellow spines. The plant produces clusters of showy, orange to yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically tubular in shape. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry conditions. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
