    "intro": "Hydranthelium humifusum, commonly known as the ground liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure that grows close to the ground, often in moist, shaded environments. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a protonema stage that develops into a gametophyte. Hydranthelium humifusum reproduces via spores, which are released from sporangia formed on the upper surface of its thallus. This species is an important indicator of undisturbed, humid habitats and plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling."
