    "intro": "Haworthia margaritifera subvar. acuminata, commonly known as the Cape tulip, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically green with white or yellow markings. The leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and ease of care, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
