It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and lanceolate leaves with a blunt tip. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture."
