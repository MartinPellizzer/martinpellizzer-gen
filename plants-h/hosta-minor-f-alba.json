    "intro": "Hosta minor f. alba, commonly known as the white hosta, is a variant of the common hosta, characterized by its striking white to pale green foliage. This plant is native to Japan and is prized for its elegant, broad, heart-shaped leaves that often exhibit a variegated pattern. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in late summer, though they are less prominent than its foliage. Hosta minor f. alba is a popular choice for ornamental gardens due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of cultivation."
