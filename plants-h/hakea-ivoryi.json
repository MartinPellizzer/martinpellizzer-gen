    "intro": "Hakea ivoryi, commonly known as the silver-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which provides a striking visual contrast to its green stems and flowers. The plant produces small, pink or red flowers that appear in late winter to early spring. Hakea ivoryi is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for low-water gardens. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for native landscaping."
