    "intro": "Helichrysum album, commonly known as the everlasting daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces fluffy, seed-filled spheres that are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Helichrysum album is also valued for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
