    "intro": "Helichrysum grandibracteatum, commonly known as the golden marguerite or African daisy, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of yellow-orange flowers that resemble miniature sunflowers, which bloom from spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The plant is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine."
