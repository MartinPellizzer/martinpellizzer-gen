    "intro": "Hieracium praevarianum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along streambanks, preferring well-drained soils. Its yellow flowers, which bloom in summer, are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and the leaves are lance-shaped with rough textures. Hieracium praevarianum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
