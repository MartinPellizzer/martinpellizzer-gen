    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. praecox, commonly known as early common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, meadows, and waste areas, and prefers full sun to partial shade. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from early spring to summer. Its leaves are basal and rosette-like, with a hairy texture, and the stems are often reddish and covered in fine hairs. It is characterized by its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in various habitats."
