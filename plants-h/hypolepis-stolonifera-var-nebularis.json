    "intro": "Hypolepis stolonifera var. nebularis, commonly known as the nebular fern, is a variant of the stoloniferous water fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant exhibits a creeping growth habit through stolons, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in its ecological interactions. The species is noted for its unique morphological features and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
