    "intro": "Helianthemum leptophyllum var. psilosepalum, commonly known as the narrow-sepal sandmat, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to xeriscaping efforts."
