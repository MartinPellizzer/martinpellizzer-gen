    "intro": "Hakea zygoloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces cylindrical, red or pink flower spikes that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils make it well adapted to arid environments. Hakea zygoloba is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
