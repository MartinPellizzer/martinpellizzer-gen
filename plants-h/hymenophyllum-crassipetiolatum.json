    "intro": "Hymenophyllum crassipetiolatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed filmy fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It features delicate, translucent fronds with a unique, lace-like appearance, characterized by its finely divided, linear leaves. The plant's rhizomes are short and often covered in a layer of fine, hairy structures. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation."
