It is characterized by its single, lance-shaped leaf and produces a spike of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and grasslands. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its delicate appearance and specialized pollination mechanisms. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
