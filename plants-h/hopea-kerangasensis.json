    "intro": "Hopea kerangasensis, commonly known as the Kerangas hopea, is a tropical tree species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its large, oblong leaves with a smooth, dark green upper surface. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, and it relies on insect pollination. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. This species is often found in lowland dipterocarp forests and plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
