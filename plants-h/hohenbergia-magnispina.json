    "intro": "Hohenbergia magnispina, commonly known as the giant spine orchid, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences with white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
