    "intro": "Haloragis tetragyna var. genuina, commonly known as the narrow-leaved waterwheel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically narrow and slightly succulent. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring, and it is often found in wetland or swampy habitats. It is adapted to waterlogged soils and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment. Haloragis tetragyna var. genuina is also valued for its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
