    "intro": "Hieracium pseudoboreale, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. This species typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils at high elevations. Its leaves are usually basal, forming a rosette, and are covered with fine hairs that help reduce water loss in cold environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to the biodiversity of its high-altitude ecosystems."
