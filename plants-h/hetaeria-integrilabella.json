    "intro": "Hetaeria integrilabella, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. It exhibits a carnivorous habit, supplementing its nutrient intake by digesting trapped prey. Its leaves are usually whorled and have a smooth, waxy surface, adapted for both floating and submerged growth."
