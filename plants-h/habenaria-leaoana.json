It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and grasslands. The plant features a pseudobulb that supports its growth and stores water, which helps it survive in varying environmental conditions. Its flowers are usually yellow or golden in color, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by attracting specific insects. The botanical characteristics of Habenaria leaoana make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
