    "intro": "Hippuris vulgaris var. ramificans, commonly known as the branched water-plantain, is a aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often submerged, with the upper portion sometimes emergent. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, appearing in clusters near the water's surface. This variant is distinguished by its branching stems, which give it its scientific name."
