    "intro": "Hutchinsia alpina, commonly known as the alpine hutchinsia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small white or yellow flowers. This species typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and is a characteristic component of the vegetation in the Andes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
