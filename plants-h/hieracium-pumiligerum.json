    "intro": "Hieracium pumiligerum, commonly known as the dwarf hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower heads. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
