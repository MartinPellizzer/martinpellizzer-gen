    "intro": "Hypericum orientale var. platyphyllum, commonly known as the flat-leaved St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems with opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically broader than those of the typical species. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are composed of numerous small, tubular petals. Its foliage is often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
