    "intro": "Hieracium chloranthum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and its leaves are typically basal, with a rough, hairy texture. Hieracium chloranthum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies due to its abundant nectar-rich flowers."
