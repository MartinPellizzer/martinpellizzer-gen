    "intro": "Hieracium trichocladum, commonly known as the hairy yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in a flat-topped inflorescence. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grasslands. It has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in some areas. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
