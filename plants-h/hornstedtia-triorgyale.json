    "intro": "Hornstedtia triorgyale, commonly known as the three-lobed orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, tri-lobed floral structure, which gives it its scientific name. Native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its flowers are typically pale green to white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hornstedtia triorgyale is considered a species of conservation concern."
