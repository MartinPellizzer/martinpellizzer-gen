    "intro": "Hedysarum pobtusum, commonly known as the woolly vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Hedysarum pobtusum plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
