    "intro": "Heliophila seselifolia, commonly known as the water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils. Heliophila seselifolia is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
