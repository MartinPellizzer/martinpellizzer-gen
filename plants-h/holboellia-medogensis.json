It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cold, arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it is known for its ornamental value due to its striking floral display. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
