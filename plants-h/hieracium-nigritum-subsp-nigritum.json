    "intro": "Hieracium nigritum subsp. nigritum, commonly known as the black hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It produces seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread across various habitats. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
