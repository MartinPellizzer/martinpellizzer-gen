    "intro": "Hydrocotyle pallida, commonly known as white marsh mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features a rosette of smooth, pale green, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in umbels. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, swampy soils. Hydrocotyle pallida is often found in marshes, along stream banks, and in other wetland habitats."
