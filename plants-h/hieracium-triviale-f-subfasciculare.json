    "intro": "Hieracium triviale f. subfasciculare, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is found in meadows, roadsides, and wetlands. Its subspecies, subfasciculare, is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and clustered inflorescences. It is a common weed in temperate regions and has a long history of use in traditional medicine."
