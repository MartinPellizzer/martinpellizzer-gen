    "intro": "Hackelochloa, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a genus of grasses native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its fine, silvery-blue foliage and dense, mat-like growth habit. The plants typically form low-growing, perennial tufts with narrow, grass-like leaves. Hackelochloa species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. They play a significant role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
