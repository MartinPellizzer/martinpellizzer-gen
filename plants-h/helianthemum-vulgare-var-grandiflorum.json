    "intro": "Helianthemum vulgare var. grandiflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered sandthrift, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are gray-green, hairy, and often covered in fine white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This species is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a common sight in coastal and inland regions with dry climates."
