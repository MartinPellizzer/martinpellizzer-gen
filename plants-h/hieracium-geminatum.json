    "intro": "Hieracium geminatum, commonly known as the twinleaf hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are yellow with a central disc. Hieracium geminatum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common yet sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
