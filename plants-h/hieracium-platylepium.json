    "intro": "Hieracium platylepium, commonly known as the broadleaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the daisy family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly lance-shaped leaves and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically clustered in a single inflorescence at the end of each stem. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
