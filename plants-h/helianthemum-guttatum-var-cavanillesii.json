    "intro": "Helianthemum guttatum var. cavanillesii, commonly known as the Cavanilles' rosebay, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has fleshy, rounded leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in Mediterranean climates."
