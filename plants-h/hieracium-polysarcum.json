It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and leafy stems. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a rough texture, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a cluster. It is considered a weed in some regions due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
