    "intro": "Hypericum septinervium, commonly known as the narrow-veined St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and opposite, elliptic leaves with distinct, narrow veins. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Hypericum septinervium is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
