    "intro": "Hoya omlorii, commonly known as the \"Flower of the Moon,\" is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of star-shaped, waxy white flowers that bloom at night. The plant is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is known for its ability to climb using aerial roots. Hoya omlorii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique flowering pattern and striking appearance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
