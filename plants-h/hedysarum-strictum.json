    "intro": "Hedysarum strictum, commonly known as the narrowleaf vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow or orange flowers in late spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and rocky environments. Hedysarum strictum is often found in grasslands, woodlands, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in soil stabilization."
