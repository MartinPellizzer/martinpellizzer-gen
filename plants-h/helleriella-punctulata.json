    "intro": "Helleriella punctulata, commonly known as the spotted rock cress, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. The plant features small, basal leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are bright yellow, with four petals and numerous stamens, forming a striking contrast against the foliage. Helleriella punctulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
