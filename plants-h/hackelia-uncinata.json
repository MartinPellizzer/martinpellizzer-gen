    "intro": "Hackelia uncinata, commonly known as stickyweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces sticky, glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Hackelia uncinata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
