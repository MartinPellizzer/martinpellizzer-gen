    "intro": "Hemizonia fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered hemizonia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and arranged in clusters, while its flowers are small and yellow, often grouped in inflorescences. Hemizonia fasciculata is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
