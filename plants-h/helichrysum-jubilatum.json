    "intro": "Helichrysum jubilatum, commonly known as the golden marguerite, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that retain their color even when dried. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its foliage is aromatic and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant is also valued for its ornamental use and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
