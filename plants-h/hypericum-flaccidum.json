The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Hypericum flaccidum is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value."
