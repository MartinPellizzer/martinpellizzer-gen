It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence consists of a single flower head surrounded by leaf-like bracts, which give it its common name. It is part of the Asteraceae family and has a low-growing, spreading habit."
