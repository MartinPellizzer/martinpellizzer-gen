    "intro": "Hohenbergia estevesii, commonly known as the Estevess hohenbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with red or purple markings. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences that bear small, showy flowers in shades of white and pink. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hohenbergia estevesii is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
