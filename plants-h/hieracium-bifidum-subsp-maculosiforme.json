    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. maculosiforme, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its hairy, basal rosette of leaves and its clusters of yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its distinctive, irregularly shaped leaves that often have a reddish or purple hue. It produces small, herbaceous stems that bear the showy, daisy-like flowers, which attract various pollinators. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it is considered a weed in some regions and can invade grasslands and disturbed soils."
