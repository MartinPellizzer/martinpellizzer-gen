    "intro": "Heynella, commonly known as the \"bitterroot,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to western North America, particularly in the United States and Canada. These plants are characterized by their compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. Heynella species are often found in dry, rocky habitats and are adapted to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. They are also known for their edible seeds, which have been used by Indigenous peoples for food and medicinal purposes."
