    "intro": "Hymenophyllum superbum, commonly known as the common hairy shield fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the world. It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like fronds that are covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant typically grows on rocks, tree trunks, or other moist surfaces, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. The species is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
