    "intro": "Habenaria macrodactyla, commonly known as the broad-fingered orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces large, lance-shaped leaves and has a complex root system adapted for nutrient absorption in its natural habitat. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and is often found growing on tree trunks or in rocky crevices. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated by enthusiasts, though it remains relatively rare in the wild."
