    "intro": "Hemisphaera saxifraga, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a hardy perennial plant native to alpine and rocky environments in Europe. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, bright green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a splash of color to its rocky habitat. Hemisphaera saxifraga is adapted to harsh conditions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its unique morphology and resilience make it a notable species in high-altitude ecosystems."
