    "intro": "Haloragis gjellerupii, commonly known as the Gjellerup's willowherb, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in damp, nutrient-poor soils, often near streams or in wetlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, and it is well adapted to the cool, moist climate of its native habitat. Haloragis gjellerupii is an important species in the ecological makeup of New Zealand's freshwater ecosystems."
