    "intro": "Hieracium leptacinoides, commonly known as the slender cow wheat, is a flowering plant species belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of western Asia, this plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while the plant produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is a relatively short-lived perennial, often found in nutrient-poor soils."
