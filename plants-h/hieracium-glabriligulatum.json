It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are usually smooth and lance-shaped, with a hairy stem that distinguishes it from other hawkweed species. The flowers are yellow and bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
