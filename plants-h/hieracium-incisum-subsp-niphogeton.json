    "intro": "Hieracium incisum subsp. niphogeton, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosettes of lanceolate, serrated leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a single terminal head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in nutrient-poor, alpine environments, often growing in rocky or grassy habitats at high elevations. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to cold, harsh climates with limited growing seasons."
