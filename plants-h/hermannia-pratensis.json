    "intro": "Hermannia pratensis, commonly known as the marsh hermannia, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in Africa. It features erect, slender stems that bear opposite, oval-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, often with a distinctive yellow or greenish throat. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Hermannia pratensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity."
