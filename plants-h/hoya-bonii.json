    "intro": "Hoya bonii, commonly known as the \"Snow Queen\" hoya, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of star-shaped white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without being parasitic. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hoya bonii is popular among indoor gardeners for its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
