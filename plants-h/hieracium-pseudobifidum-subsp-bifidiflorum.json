It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring moist to moderately dry conditions. Its flowers consist of both ray and disk florets, with the distinctive bifid (split) petals on the outer florets. The subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its bright yellow blooms."
