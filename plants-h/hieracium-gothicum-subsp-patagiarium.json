    "intro": "Hieracium gothicum subsp. patagiarium, commonly known as the Patagonian hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and typical sunflower-like structure. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has alternate, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
