    "intro": "Huperzia fordii, commonly known as the Ford's clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its spirally arranged, needle-like leaves that form a dense, cushion-like structure. Huperzia fordii reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its sporophyte stage is characterized by a short, unbranched stem. This plant is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological significance in forest ecosystems."
