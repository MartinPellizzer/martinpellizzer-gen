    "intro": "Habenaria carvajaliana, commonly known as the Carvajal's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high altitudes of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in the summer months, producing intricate, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with distinctive markings. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests or high-altitude grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
