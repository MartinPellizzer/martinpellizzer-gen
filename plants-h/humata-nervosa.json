    "intro": "Humata nervosa, commonly known as the delicate fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as under forest canopies. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family."
