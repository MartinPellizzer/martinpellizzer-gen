    "intro": "Hypericum stenocarpum, commonly known as narrow-fruited St. John's wort, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and woody stems, which are typical features of the Hypericaceae family. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds, and its leaves are opposite and often covered in small glands. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. The plant has been used in traditional medicine, though its medicinal properties are less well-documented compared to other Hypericum species."
