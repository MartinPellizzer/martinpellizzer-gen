    "intro": "Hieracium sparsum subsp. coldei, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. It is often found in calcareous soils and is a characteristic species of subalpine vegetation."
