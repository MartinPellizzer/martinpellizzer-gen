    "intro": "Hosta odorata, commonly known as the fragrant hosta, is a perennial plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a silvery underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is well-suited for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its subtle, pleasant scent."
