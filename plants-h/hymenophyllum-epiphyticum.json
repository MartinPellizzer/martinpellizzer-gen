    "intro": "Hymenophyllum epiphyticum, commonly known as the common mistletoe fern, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air and rain through its rhizomes. It is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique structure allows it to survive in nutrient-poor environments by relying on atmospheric humidity."
