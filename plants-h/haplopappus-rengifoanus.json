    "intro": "Haplopappus rengifoanus, commonly known as the Rengifo's pappus, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and wind-dispersed seeds. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it exhibits adaptations to cold and arid conditions. Its small, daisy-like flowers are usually yellow or white, and it produces pappus structures that aid in seed dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
