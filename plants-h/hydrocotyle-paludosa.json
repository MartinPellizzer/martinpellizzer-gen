    "intro": "Hydrocotyle paludosa, commonly known as marsh spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features a rosette of heart-shaped, smooth, and often hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in soggy conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in marshy areas, contributing to wetland ecology. Hydrocotyle paludosa is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams."
