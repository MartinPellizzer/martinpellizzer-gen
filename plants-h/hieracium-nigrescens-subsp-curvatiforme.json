    "intro": "Hieracium nigrescens subsp. curvatiforme, commonly known as the bent-leaf hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant features basal rosettes of dark green, hairy leaves that curl upward, giving it its distinctive appearance. Its flowers are yellow and borne in clusters, with petal-like bracts that are often mistaken for petals. The subspecies is characterized by its curved leaf shape and is part of the larger hawkweed complex, which includes several closely related species."
