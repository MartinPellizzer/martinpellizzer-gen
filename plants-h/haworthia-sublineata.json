    "intro": "Haworthia sublineata, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically green with distinct white or pale markings. The leaves are fleshy and covered in a layer of fine white hairs, which help reduce water loss. It produces small, white flowers on tall, slender stems during the growing season. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
