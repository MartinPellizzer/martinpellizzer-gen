    "intro": "Hippocratea zippeliana, commonly known as the Zippel's hippocratea, is a rare and striking member of the Fabaceae family. It is native to the humid forests of western Ecuador, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
