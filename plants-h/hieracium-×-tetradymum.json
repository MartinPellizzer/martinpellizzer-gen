    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 tetradymum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has basal leaves that are lance-shaped with hairy surfaces. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
