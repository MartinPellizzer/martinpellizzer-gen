    "intro": "Hieracium serratoellipticum, commonly known as the serrated elliptic hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to Europe and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can compete with native flora in certain regions."
