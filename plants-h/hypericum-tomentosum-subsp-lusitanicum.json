    "intro": "Hypericum tomentosum subsp. lusitanicum, commonly known as the woolly St. John's wort, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It is a low-growing shrub with dark green, hairy leaves that are often covered in a dense white tomentum. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
