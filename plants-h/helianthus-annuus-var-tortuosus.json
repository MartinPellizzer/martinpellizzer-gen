    "intro": "Helianthus annuus var. tortuosus, commonly known as the twisted sunflower, is a variant of the common sunflower characterized by its uniquely twisted or coiled flower heads. This botanical feature is a result of genetic variation and is most prominent in the ray florets, which spiral around the central disk. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas and is native to North America. It exhibits the typical sunflower morphology with large, yellow petals surrounding a central cluster of smaller florets. While not widely cultivated for agriculture, it is of interest in botanical studies due to its distinctive form."
