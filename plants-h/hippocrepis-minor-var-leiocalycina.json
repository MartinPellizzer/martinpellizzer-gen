    "intro": "Hippocrepis minor var. leiocalycina, commonly known as the lesser helmet orchid, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are usually pink or purple with a distinctive helmet-shaped lip. This variety is noted for its rarity and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas."
