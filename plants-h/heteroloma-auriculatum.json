    "intro": "Heteroloma auriculatum, commonly known as the auriculate heteroloma, is a rare and delicate fern native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, intricate fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its unique morphology includes auriculate (ear-shaped) lobes on the fronds, which give it its common name. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
