    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. pseudobellidiforme, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features a rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in a single, terminal head. The plant is characterized by its finely divided leaves and a distinct, hollow stem. It thrives in moist, grassy areas and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in some regions."
