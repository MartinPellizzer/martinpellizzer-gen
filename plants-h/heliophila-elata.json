    "intro": "Heliophila elata, commonly known as the marsh woundwort, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Plantain family (Plantaginaceae) and typically grows in moist or waterlogged soils. The plant features slender stems that often root at the nodes, and its small, white or pale blue flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Heliophila elata has lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. It is valued in traditional herbal medicine for its purported healing properties."
