    "intro": "Hieracium pseudorosulatum, commonly known as the false rose dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in grassy areas and along roadsides. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its scientific name reflects its resemblance to other species within the Hieracium genus, though it is distinct in morphology and habitat preference. The plant is often mistaken for other dandelion-like species due to its similar appearance."
