    "intro": "Hieracium notophilum, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in dry environments. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and it produces seeds in small, fluffy clusters. It is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
