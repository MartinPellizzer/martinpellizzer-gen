    "intro": "Heterocentron dicranantherum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Nymphaeaceae and is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant has a distinctive heterocentric stigma, which is a key feature in its reproductive biology. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss, while its roots anchor it in shallow water. This species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
