    "intro": "Herminium congestum, commonly known as the clustered lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features a dense cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a spike of small, fragrant white or pale blue flowers. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it is often found in association with other orchid species. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
