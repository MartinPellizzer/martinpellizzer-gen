    "intro": "Helichrysum bracteatum f. incurvum, commonly known as the curly everlasting, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and thrives in dry, sunny conditions. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and containers. The foliage is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting, dried appearance."
