    "intro": "Hermione \u00d7 corcyrensis, commonly known as the hybrid spider orchid, is a striking plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a hybrid between two species of spider orchids, Hermione filiformis and Corcyrea macrophylla, and is characterized by its long, slender, spider-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. It features a sympodial growth habit with a rhizomatous root system, and its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific conditions to thrive."
