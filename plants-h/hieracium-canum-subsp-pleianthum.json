    "intro": "Hieracium canum subsp. pleianthum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It has serrated leaves and produces achenes as its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
