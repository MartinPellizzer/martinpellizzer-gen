    "intro": "Habenaria susannae, commonly known as the Annaliese orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that often display a mix of white, pink, and purple hues. The plant typically grows in tropical rainforests, where it thrives in the shade of the canopy. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural range."
