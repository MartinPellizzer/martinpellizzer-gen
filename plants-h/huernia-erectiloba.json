    "intro": "Huernia erectiloba, commonly known as the erect-stemmed horned orchid, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and spiky, tubular flowers. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, bloom in summer and are surrounded by bracts that resemble small horns. Huernia erectiloba is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
