    "intro": "Hildmannia, commonly known as the false hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. These plants are native to the Americas, particularly Central and South America, and are often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Hildmannia species typically have showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a distinctive yellow or orange center. The leaves are usually alternate, simple, and sometimes hairy, while the stems are often woody or herbaceous depending on the species. Hildmannia plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their vibrant blooms."
