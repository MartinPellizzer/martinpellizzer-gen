    "intro": "Hypericum richeri var. grisebachii, commonly known as the gray-stemmed St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its woody stems that have a distinctive grayish hue, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively hardy in mild climates."
