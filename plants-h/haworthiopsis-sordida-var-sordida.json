It features dense rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with a distinctive brownish or reddish tinge on the upper surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
