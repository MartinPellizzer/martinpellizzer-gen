    "intro": "Hemisteptia lyrata f. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered lyreleaf dandelion, is a rare and striking variant of the lyreleaf dandelion. It is characterized by its white petals, which contrast sharply with its green, lyre-shaped leaves. This plant is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in Brazil. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it a unique subject for ecological and horticultural study."
