    "intro": "Hessea stenosiphon, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and woody structure. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. Hessea stenosiphon is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
