It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of eastern Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often accompanied by a strong, aromatic scent. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
