    "intro": "Hedysarum coelesyriacum, commonly known as the Armenian vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces delicate, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates, making it a hardy and resilient species. Hedysarum coelesyriacum plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by fixing nitrogen and supporting local biodiversity."
