    "intro": "Helichrysum dykei, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, golden-yellow flowers that are often used in dried floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Helichrysum dykei thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
