    "intro": "Hypericum mutisianum, commonly known as the Sierra Madre St. John's Wort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Hypericaceae and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. Its leaves are simple and opposite, with a rough texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Hypericum mutisianum is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its high-altitude environment."
