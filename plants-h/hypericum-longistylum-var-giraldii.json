    "intro": "Hypericum longistylum var. giraldii, commonly known as the long-stemmed St. John's wort, is a variant of the St. John's wort genus native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, elongated stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has small, opposite leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its medicinal properties are similar to other Hypericum species, though it is less commonly used in traditional herbal remedies. The varietal distinction is based on subtle differences in stem length and floral structure compared to the typical form of Hypericum longistylum."
