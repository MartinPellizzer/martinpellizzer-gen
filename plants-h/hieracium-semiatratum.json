    "intro": "Hieracium semiatratum, commonly known as the lesser hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It has basal leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate, with hairy surfaces, and produces yellow flowers from June to September. Hieracium semiatratum is often found in moist or slightly shaded environments, and it can form dense colonies in suitable conditions."
