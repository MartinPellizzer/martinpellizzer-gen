    "intro": "Hibiscus cryptocarpos, commonly known as the rock hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in summer. Hibiscus cryptocarpos is adapted to survive in dry, rocky environments, with deep roots that help it access water from underground sources. Its botanical features make it a hardy, drought-tolerant species well-suited for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
