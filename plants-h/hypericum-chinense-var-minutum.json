    "intro": "Hypericum chinense var. minutum, commonly known as the small-flowered St. John's wort, is a low-growing shrub native to China. It features small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a ground cover. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature."
