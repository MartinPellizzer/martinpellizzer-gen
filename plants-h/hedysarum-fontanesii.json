It is a perennial legume that typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, characterized by its low, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellow to orange flowers clustered in racemes. It has a deep root system that helps stabilize soil in rocky and arid environments. Hedysarum fontanesii is valued for its ecological role in preventing soil erosion and its potential use in restoration projects."
