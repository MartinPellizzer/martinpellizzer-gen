It features fleshy, tubular leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, often marked with distinctive white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers on tall, slender stems during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for indoor cultivation. Its compact size and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container plantings."
