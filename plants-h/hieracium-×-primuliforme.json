It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which resemble those of dandelions, and its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It is known for its ability to spread via rhizomes and seeds, making it both a common wildflower and a potential weed. Its botanical features make it an important species for pollinators and a subject of ecological study."
