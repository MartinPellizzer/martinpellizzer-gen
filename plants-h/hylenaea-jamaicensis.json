    "intro": "Hylenaea jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican hylenia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean region, particularly Jamaica and parts of the Greater Antilles. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with lance-shaped leaves and yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
