It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy addition to Mediterranean-style landscapes."
