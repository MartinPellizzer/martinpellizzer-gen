    "intro": "Hydrophyllum occidentale, commonly known as western greenbriar, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense colonies, making it a persistent weed in disturbed soils. Hydrophyllum occidentale is adapted to a variety of soil types but thrives in moist, well-drained environments."
