    "intro": "Heinzelia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Proteaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and are characterized by their woody stems and distinctive foliage. Heinzelia species typically have small, clustered leaves and produce showy, often pink or red, inflorescences. They are well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to their ornamental value and ecological importance, some species of Heinzelia are cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
