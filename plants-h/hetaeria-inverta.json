    "intro": "Hetaeria inverta, commonly known as the inverted hetaeria, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Acanthaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring showy, tubular flowers that are often brightly colored. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, with lance-shaped leaves and a branching stem. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their nectar-rich nature and coloration. Hetaeria inverta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to a range of growing conditions."
