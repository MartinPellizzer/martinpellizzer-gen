    "intro": "Henriettea triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered henriette, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and knotweeds. The plant is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. Henriettea triflora thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
