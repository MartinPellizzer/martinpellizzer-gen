    "intro": "Haemocharis obovata, commonly known as the golden flame plant, is a tropical herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow, torch-like inflorescences that emerge from a rosette of glossy, dark green leaves. The leaves are obovate in shape, meaning they are broad at the base and taper towards the tip. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant and long-lasting flowers."
