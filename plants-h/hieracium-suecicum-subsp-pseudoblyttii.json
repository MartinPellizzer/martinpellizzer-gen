It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a fibrous root system and is often found in temperate regions of Europe. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
