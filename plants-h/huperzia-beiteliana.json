It is characterized by its erect, branching stems covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporangia on specialized structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of the branches. Huperzia beiteliana is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
