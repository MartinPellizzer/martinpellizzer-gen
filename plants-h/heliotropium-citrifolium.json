    "intro": "Heliotropium citrifolium, commonly known as lemonleaf heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often tinged with yellow, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a faint violet hue. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or near water bodies. Heliotropium citrifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
