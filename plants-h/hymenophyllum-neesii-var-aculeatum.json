    "intro": "Hymenophyllum neesii var. aculeatum, commonly known as the aculeate fern, is a small, delicate epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a small, kidney-shaped indusium. This variety is notable for its unique morphology and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical gardens."
