    "intro": "Holodiscus, commonly known as the golden disc or false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico, where it thrives in dry, open habitats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are arranged in a disc-like structure, giving it its common name. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Holodiscus is often used in ornamental gardening due to its delicate appearance and drought tolerance."
