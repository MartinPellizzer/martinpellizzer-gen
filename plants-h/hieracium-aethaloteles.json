    "intro": "Hieracium aethaloteles, commonly known as the pale spearthistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are usually spiny and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow and arranged in a single head. Hieracium aethaloteles is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
