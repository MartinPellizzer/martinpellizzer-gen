    "intro": "Halimocnemis brachiata, commonly known as the coastal goldenbush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, yellow-green foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it withstand harsh coastal conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, providing some protection against salt spray and wind. Halimocnemis brachiata is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
