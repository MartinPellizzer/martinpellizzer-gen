It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly found in countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The plant is characterized by its low-growing shrub form with evergreen leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring.

Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
