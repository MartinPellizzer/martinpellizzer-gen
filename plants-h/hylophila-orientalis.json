    "intro": "Hylophila orientalis, commonly known as the oriental water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that float on the water's surface. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients. Hylophila orientalis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
