    "intro": "Hesperastragalus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers and compound leaves. The plants typically have deep taproots that allow them to survive in dry, rocky soils. Hesperastragalus species are often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where they play a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife. Some species are also used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
