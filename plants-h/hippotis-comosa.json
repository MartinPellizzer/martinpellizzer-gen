It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant has thin, branching stems and small, hairy leaves that help in floating and photosynthesis. It is often found in slow-moving water or still pools. Hippotis comosa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and serving as a food source for various aquatic animals."
