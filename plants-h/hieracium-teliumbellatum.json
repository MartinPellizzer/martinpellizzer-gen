    "intro": "Hieracium teliumbellatum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its bright yellow flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn, and the leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. Hieracium teliumbellatum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
