    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. subtenuiflorum, commonly known as the narrow-flowered hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers consist of a central disk surrounded by ray florets. This subspecies is distinguished by its slender, elongated flower stems and smaller, more delicate flowers compared to other hawkweed species."
