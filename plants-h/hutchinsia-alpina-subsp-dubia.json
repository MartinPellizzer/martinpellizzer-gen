    "intro": "Hutchinsia alpina subsp. dubia, commonly known as the alpine hutchinsia, is a rare and specialized plant native to high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to low nutrient conditions. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
