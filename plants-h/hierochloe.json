    "intro": "Hierochloe, commonly known as bentgrass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. These plants are typically low-growing and form dense mats, often found in moist or wet environments. Hierochloe species are characterized by their fine, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit. They are often used in horticulture for lawns and as ground cover due to their durability and aesthetic appeal. Some species are also valued for their ecological roles in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
