    "intro": "Haematocarpus, commonly known as the bloodgrass, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the grass family, Poaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive red or purple pigmentation in their inflorescences, which gives them their common name. They are typically found in temperate regions and are often associated with disturbed soils or grasslands. Haematocarpus species are perennial herbs that produce small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in horticulture for their ornamental value."
