It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often pubescent. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are arranged in dense spikes, and it produces flat, leathery pods that contain several seeds.
