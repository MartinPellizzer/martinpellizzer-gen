    "intro": "Helichrysum virgatum, commonly known as the Cape golden bush, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that are often retained on the plant even after blooming. The plant is evergreen, with dense, bushy growth and narrow, leathery leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to retain its color and form throughout the year."
