    "intro": "Hedysarum glutinosum, commonly known as sticky vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by bean-like pods containing edible seeds. Hedysarum glutinosum is adapted to rocky and dry soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its sticky hairs on the stems and leaves help reduce water loss and deter herbivores."
