    "intro": "Hamosa subuniflora, commonly known as the single-flower hamosa, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and have a mild, aromatic scent, while its flowers are small and white, often appearing in clusters. Hamosa subuniflora is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
