    "intro": "Hieracium dolense, commonly known as the Dolent hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in a composite head. Native to Europe, it is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread vegetatively. It is considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its aggressive growth habit."
