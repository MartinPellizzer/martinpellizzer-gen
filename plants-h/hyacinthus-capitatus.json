    "intro": "Hyacinthus capitatus, commonly known as the Cape hyacinth, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, globular clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and it produces long, slender stems that support its showy inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. The Cape hyacinth is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
