    "intro": "Hippia trilobata, commonly known as the three-lobed spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is characterized by its milky sap and often striking floral structures. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three distinct lobes, and it produces small, clustered yellow flowers. The species is often considered invasive in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
