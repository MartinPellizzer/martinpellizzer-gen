It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, and it thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are rough and hairy, with a distinctive lobed shape, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk.
