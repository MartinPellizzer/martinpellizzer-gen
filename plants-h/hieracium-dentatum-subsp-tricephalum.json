    "intro": "Hieracium dentatum subsp. tricephalum, commonly known as the three-headed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom from June to September. Its flowering heads are distinctive, often appearing as three separate clusters, giving it its common name. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread vegetatively."
