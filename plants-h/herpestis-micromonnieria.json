    "intro": "Herpestis micromonnieria, commonly known as the narrowleaf false indigo, is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and floral structures typical of legumes. It is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States, particularly found in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps. The plant features slender, erect stems with opposite, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pale blue or purple, with a distinctive spurred petal that aids in pollination by specific insects. The seeds are enclosed in legumes, which split open to release the seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in moist environments."
