    "intro": "Hieracium epileucum, commonly known as the pale hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It produces numerous small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native flora and alter local ecosystems."
