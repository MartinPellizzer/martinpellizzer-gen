    "intro": "Hieracium magyaricum subsp. adenocymum, commonly known as the Hungarian hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy stems. The subspecies is distinguished by its glandular-cysted leaves and a more compact growth habit compared to other hawkweed species. It typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. This plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores."
