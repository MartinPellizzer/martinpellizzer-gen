    "intro": "Helianthemum pannosum subsp. frigidulum, commonly known as the Arctic sandverbena, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in harsh, cold environments, often found on rocky slopes and tundra. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in a fine layer of white hairs to reduce water loss. This subspecies is well adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient component of polar ecosystems."
