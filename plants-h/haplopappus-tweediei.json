    "intro": "Haplopappus tweediei, commonly known as the slender pappus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky slopes and sandy soils. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces a pappus, a feathery structure that aids in seed dispersal. Haplopappus tweediei is adapted to drought conditions and is often found in desert regions."
