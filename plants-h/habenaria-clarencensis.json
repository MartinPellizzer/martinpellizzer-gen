    "intro": "Habenaria clarencensis, commonly known as the Clarence orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Australia, specifically found in Queensland. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose raceme, typically blooming in spring. Its roots are fibrous, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
