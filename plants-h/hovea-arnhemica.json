    "intro": "Hovea arnhemica, commonly known as the Arnhem hovea, is a rare flowering plant native to the Northern Territory of Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are typically followed by flat, bean-like pods. Hovea arnhemica is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing features that enable it to thrive in low-resource conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
