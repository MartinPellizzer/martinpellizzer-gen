    "intro": "Heteropogon truncatus, commonly known as the common flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in the Americas. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that are typically green or brown in color. The plant is characterized by its short, compressed stems and is often found in shallow water or saturated soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Heteropogon truncatus is also used in some traditional herbal remedies."
