    "intro": "Hieracium sparsiflorum subsp. malomvizense, commonly known as the Malomvizian hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosettes of leaves, which are typically covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a single, terminal capitulum, which is surrounded by bracts. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
