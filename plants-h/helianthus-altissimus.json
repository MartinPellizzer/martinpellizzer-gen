It features large, showy yellow flowers with a dark central disk, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. The plant has smooth, hairy stems that can grow up to 6 feet in height, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. It thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The swamp sunflower is an important nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
