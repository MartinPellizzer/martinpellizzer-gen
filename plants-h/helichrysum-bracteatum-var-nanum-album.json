    "intro": "Helichrysum bracteatum var. nanum-album, commonly known as the dwarf silver helichrysum, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, silver-white flower heads that resemble tiny sunbursts, giving it a striking visual appearance. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its silvery hue. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to retain its color and form even after flowering, adding year-round interest to garden landscapes."
