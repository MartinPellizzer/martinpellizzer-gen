    "intro": "Habenaria hyperborea var. media, commonly known as the Alpine marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in alpine and subalpine habitats. It has a complex root system that helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
