    "intro": "Hierochloe praetermissa, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage, which is covered in dense, silky hairs. The plant typically forms dense mats or cushions, which help it survive in harsh, cold environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Hierochloe praetermissa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms in its native habitats."
