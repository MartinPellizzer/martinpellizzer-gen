    "intro": "Hieracium halleri var. longistylum, commonly known as the long-styled hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellowish to reddish flower heads, which consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped with rough, hairy surfaces, and the stems are usually erect and covered in fine pubescence. This variant is distinguished by its elongated styles in the flowers, which contribute to its taxonomic classification."
