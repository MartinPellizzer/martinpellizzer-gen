    "intro": "Hieracium subrubens subsp. finalense, commonly known as the Finalen hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It has basal leaves that are lanceolate and often covered in fine hairs, and its stem is upright with few branches. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
