    "intro": "Hymenophyllum edanoi, commonly known as the mossy fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are densely packed and have a velvety texture, which helps retain moisture. The spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, cup-like formations on the underside of the fronds."
