    "intro": "Helleborus hunfalvyanus var. odorus, commonly known as the sweet-scented hellebore, is a rare and distinctive member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is native to the Carpathian Mountains in Central Europe, where it thrives in shaded, moist woodland environments. The plant is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. One of its most notable features is its fragrant, sweet scent, which is more pronounced in the evening. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
