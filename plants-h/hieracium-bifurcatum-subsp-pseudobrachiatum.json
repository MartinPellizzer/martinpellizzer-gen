    "intro": "Hieracium bifurcatum subsp. pseudobrachiatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, often on rocky soils and slopes. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. Its inflorescence consists of a single, elongated stem bearing numerous small florets. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaves and shorter flower stems compared to other members of the Hieracium genus."
