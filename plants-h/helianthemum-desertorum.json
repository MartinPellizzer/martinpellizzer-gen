It produces small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically blooming in spring. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
