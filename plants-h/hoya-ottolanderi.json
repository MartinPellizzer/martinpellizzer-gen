    "intro": "Hoya ottolanderi, commonly known as the \"Bloomerang\" hoya, is a popular trailing plant native to Southeast Asia. It features thick, waxy leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hoya ottolanderi is prized for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
