    "intro": "Heracleum orphanidis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cow parsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant features hollow, ridged stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in compound umbels, and it produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps. The plant is often mistaken for other toxic look-alikes, so careful identification is essential for safe handling."
