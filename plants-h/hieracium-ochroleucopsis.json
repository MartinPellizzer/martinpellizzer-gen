    "intro": "Hieracium ochroleucopsis, commonly known as the yellow spearthistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its flowers are yellow with a white or pale yellow center, and it produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Hieracium ochroleucopsis is often considered a weed but has ecological value in supporting pollinators."
