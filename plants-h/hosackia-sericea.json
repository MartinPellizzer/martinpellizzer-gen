    "intro": "Hosackia sericea, commonly known as the silverleaf false indigo, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has finely hairy leaves that give it a silvery appearance, hence its common name. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Hosackia sericea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
