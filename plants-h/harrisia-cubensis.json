    "intro": "Harrisia cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban nightshade, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It is a low-growing shrub with spiny stems and produces small, fleshy fruits that are typically green or yellow when mature. The plant's flowers are usually white or pale pink and bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Harrisia cubensis is adapted to arid environments and has a succulent structure that helps it store water. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
