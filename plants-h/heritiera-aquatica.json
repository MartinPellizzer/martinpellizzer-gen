It is a semi-aquatic species that thrives in wetland environments, often growing along the edges of rivers and lakes. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface. Its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers are usually pink or red and bloom during the rainy season. Heritiera aquatica plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic life."
