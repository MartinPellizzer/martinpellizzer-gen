It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller flower heads and shorter peduncles compared to other members of the species. It thrives in rocky and alpine habitats, often growing in open, sunny environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered plant."
