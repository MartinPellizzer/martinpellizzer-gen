    "intro": "Haematoxylum campechianum, commonly known as the logwood tree, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central America and the Caribbean. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a straight trunk and dark bark. The tree is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. Its most notable botanical feature is the dark, richly colored heartwood, which has been historically used for dyeing textiles and as a source of tannins. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland tropical forests."
