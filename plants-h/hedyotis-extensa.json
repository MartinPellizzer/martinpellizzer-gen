    "intro": "Hedyotis extensa, commonly known as the small mosquito plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, creeping growth habit. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that are often overlooked due to their size, but they are highly attractive to pollinators like bees and flies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. Hedyotis extensa is often found in moist, shaded environments and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
