It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped growth and distinctive light green to white tubular leaves with dark green stripes. The leaves are fleshy and adapted for storing water, typical of succulents. It produces small, pale green flowers on slender stems during the warmer months. This variety is relatively low maintenance and thrives in well-draining soil and bright, indirect light."
