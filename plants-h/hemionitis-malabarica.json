    "intro": "Hemionitis malabarica, commonly known as the Malabar fern, is a rare and endangered plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a small, herbaceous fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish spores. Its reproductive structures are located on the underside of the fronds, and it relies on specific microclimatic conditions for successful growth. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
