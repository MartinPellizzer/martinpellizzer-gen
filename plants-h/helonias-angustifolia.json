    "intro": "Helonias angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf marsh fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the eastern United States. It features a compact, rosette-like growth habit with dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Helonias angustifolia plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
