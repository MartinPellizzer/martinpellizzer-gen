    "intro": "Heliotropium pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf heliotrope, is a small annual herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters and features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday, a behavior known as heliotropism. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gardens. Heliotropium pusillum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
