    "intro": "Hieracium nudiceps, commonly known as the naked-stem hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems that rise directly from the base, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in a dense cluster at the tip of the stem. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Hieracium nudiceps is a perennial herb that can spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
