    "intro": "Hieracium umbrosum subsp. subexilentiforme, commonly known as the shadowy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late spring to early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its elongated, slender flower stems and reduced leaf morphology compared to other members of the species. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
