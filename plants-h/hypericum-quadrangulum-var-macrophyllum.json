    "intro": "Hypericum quadrangulum var. macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaved St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are typically larger than those of the typical species, hence its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. Its stems are often reddish and covered in fine hairs, and it is often found in moist, woodland habitats. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for various health purposes."
