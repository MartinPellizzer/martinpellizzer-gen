    "intro": "Haageocereus symmetros, commonly known as the desert rose cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its columnar stem that branches into multiple stems, forming a bushy appearance. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming during the warmer months. It has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores."
