    "intro": "Hieracium transiens subsp. zygosense, commonly known as the zigzag hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and basal rosettes of leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and roadsides. Its subspecies status reflects genetic divergence from other Hieracium species, often associated with specific ecological adaptations."
