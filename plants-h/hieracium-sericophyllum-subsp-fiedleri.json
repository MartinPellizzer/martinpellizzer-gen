    "intro": "Hieracium sericophyllum subsp. fiedleri, commonly known as the Fiedler's hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, yellowish-green stems and basal rosettes of lance-shaped, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
