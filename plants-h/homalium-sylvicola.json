It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary forests. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural dispersal in the wild."
