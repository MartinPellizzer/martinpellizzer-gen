    "intro": "Hypolytrum nemorum subsp. vitiense, commonly known as the New Zealand ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered plant species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are often greenish-white in color. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rock crevices. It has a sympodial growth habit, with multiple stems arising from a central rhizome. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
