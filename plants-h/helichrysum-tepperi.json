It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The flowers are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting color and ornamental value."
