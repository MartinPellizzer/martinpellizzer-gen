It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its distinctive toothed leaf margins and delicate floral structure make it a notable species in botanical studies."
