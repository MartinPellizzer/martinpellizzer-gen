    "intro": "Hemionitis deltoidea, commonly known as the delta fern, is a unique aquatic plant native to the wetlands of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, deltoid-shaped fronds that are typically divided into three lobes. The plant thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that release spores for propagation. Hemionitis deltoidea plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to water filtration."
