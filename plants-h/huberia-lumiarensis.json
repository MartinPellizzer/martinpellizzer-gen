    "intro": "Huberia lumiarensis, commonly known as the Luminous Nightshade, is a rare flowering plant native to the dense, humid forests of the Lumiara region. It is characterized by its bioluminescent properties, with its leaves and flowers emitting a soft blue glow at night. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in its moist, shaded habitat. Its flowers are small and star-shaped, typically blooming in clusters during the summer months. Due to its unique biological features, it is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
