    "intro": "Hylaeorchis petiolaris, commonly known as the petioled twayblade, is a small, herbaceous orchid native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant has a slender, leafless stem that supports a cluster of delicate, greenish-white flowers. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The species is characterized by its unique petiole-like structure, which gives it its common name."
