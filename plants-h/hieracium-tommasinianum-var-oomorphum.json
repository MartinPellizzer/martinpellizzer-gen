    "intro": "Hieracium tommasinianum var. oomorphum, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are broad, rough, and arranged in a basal rosette, while its flowers are grouped in clusters at the ends of the stems. This variant is distinguished by its larger, more robust leaves compared to other forms of Hieracium."
