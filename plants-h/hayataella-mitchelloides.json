    "intro": "Hayataella mitchelloides, commonly known as the Hawaiian milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red. The plant has smooth, often hairy stems and leaves that are opposite in arrangement. It produces a milky sap that is toxic, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Hayataella mitchelloides thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas on the islands of Hawaii."
