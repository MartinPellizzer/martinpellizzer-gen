    "intro": "Hieracium taurinense subsp. rotgesianum, commonly known as the Rotgesian hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has basal leaves that are broadly lanceolate and often hairy, with a flowering period that occurs in late spring to early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences from other Hieracium species."
