    "intro": "Hieracium polygonifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in the summer. The plant is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it can outcompete native flora and is sometimes considered a weed."
