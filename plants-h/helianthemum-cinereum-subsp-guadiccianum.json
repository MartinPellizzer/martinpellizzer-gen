It features small, glandular, hairy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environments."
