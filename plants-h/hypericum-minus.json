It typically features small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and sunny to partially shaded environments. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used historically for its purported calming and anti-inflammatory effects."
