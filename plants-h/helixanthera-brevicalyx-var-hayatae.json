    "intro": "Helixanthera brevicalyx var. hayatae, commonly known as the Hayata's short-lobed helixanthera, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae, which includes many ornamental and horticulturally significant species. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of tubular, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its native range."
