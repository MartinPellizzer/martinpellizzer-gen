    "intro": "Heliotropium fallax var. hintonii, commonly known as Hinton's heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
