    "intro": "Hornungia alpina subsp. alpina, commonly known as the alpine hornungia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically forms dense cushions or mats, which help it survive in harsh alpine environments. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that are covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, providing protection against cold and desiccation. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, appearing in late summer, and are clustered in short inflorescences. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes."
