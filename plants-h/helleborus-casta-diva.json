    "intro": "Helleborus casta-diva, commonly known as the Casta-Diva hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves that are often adorned with distinctive white veins. The plant produces striking, nodding flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets."
