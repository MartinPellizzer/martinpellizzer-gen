    "intro": "Hibiscus geminiflorus, commonly known as the twin-flower hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically have five to seven petals and a prominent, trumpet-shaped corolla. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Hibiscus geminiflorus thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
