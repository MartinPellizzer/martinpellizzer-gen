    "intro": "Hakea eriostachya, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, cylindrical, woody stems and dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in summer, which are followed by woody, cylindrical seed pods that persist through the winter. It is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dunes and coastal heathlands. Hakea eriostachya is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
