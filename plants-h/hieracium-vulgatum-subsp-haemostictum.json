It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and basal leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, flat-topped clusters, which bloom from June to August. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
