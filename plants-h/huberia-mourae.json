It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped foliage. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, often with a distinctive dark eye. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is widely cultivated as a houseplant."
