    "intro": "Hibiscus rigidus, commonly known as the rigid hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Hibiscus rigidus is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine, and it is also cultivated for ornamental purposes."
