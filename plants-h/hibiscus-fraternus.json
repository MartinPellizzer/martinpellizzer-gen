It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Hibiscus fraternus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for pollinators. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular choice for wetland restoration projects."
