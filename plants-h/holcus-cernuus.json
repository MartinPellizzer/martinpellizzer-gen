    "intro": "Holcus cernuus, commonly known as the bent grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its fine, soft blades and drooping inflorescences. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, while the flowers are small and clustered in panicles. Holcus cernuus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
