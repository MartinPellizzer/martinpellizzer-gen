    "intro": "Hydrocotyle uncinata, commonly known as the hooked water pennywort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are often floating or partially submerged, with a waxy surface. Its flowers are small and white, clustered in umbels, and it produces tiny, greenish fruits. Hydrocotyle uncinata is often used in water gardens and can serve as a habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
