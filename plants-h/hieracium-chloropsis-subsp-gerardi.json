    "intro": "Hieracium chloropsis subsp. gerardi, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It has a fibrous root system and produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is often considered a noxious weed."
