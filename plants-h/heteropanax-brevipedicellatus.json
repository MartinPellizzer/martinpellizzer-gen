    "intro": "Heteropanax brevipedicellatus, commonly known as the short-stemmed heteropanax, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with alternating leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, followed by berries that are typically orange or red in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
