    "intro": "Hieracium caespitosum subsp. madarum, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, with a central stem that bears yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence consists of a single, flat-topped head of small, daisy-like flowers, which are surrounded by pale yellow ray florets. The plant is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common and sometimes invasive species in its native habitats."
