    "intro": "Hypoxis subtrigyna, commonly known as the narrow-leaved starflower, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Hypoxidaceae and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces yellow, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Hypoxis subtrigyna is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
