    "intro": "Hieracium reticulatum var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer, arranged in a single head on a slender stem. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Its leaves and flowers are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions."
