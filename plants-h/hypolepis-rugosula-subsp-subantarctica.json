    "intro": "Hypolepis rugosula subsp. subantarctica, commonly known as the Antarctic shield fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the Southern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy scales. This subspecies thrives in cold, moist environments, often found in temperate rainforests and high-altitude regions. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are positioned on the underside of the fronds. The plant exhibits a unique adaptation to its harsh environment, with a slow growth rate and a long lifespan, allowing it to persist in nutrient-poor soils."
