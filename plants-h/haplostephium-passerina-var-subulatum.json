    "intro": "Haplostephium passerina var. subulatum, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and rocky habitats in western North America. It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are often borne on short, erect stems. It is adapted to well-drained soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. This variety is noted for its compact growth habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
