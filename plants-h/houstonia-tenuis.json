    "intro": "Houstonia tenuis, commonly known as the slender bladderleaf, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, pale blue or white flowers. Native to the southeastern United States, it thrives in moist, acidic soils within shaded woodland habitats. The plant's morphology is adapted to its woodland environment, with a compact growth form that helps it conserve moisture. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
