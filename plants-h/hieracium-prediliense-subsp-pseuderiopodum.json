    "intro": "Hieracium prediliense subsp. pseuderiopodum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are usually lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat, disk-like cluster. This subspecies is distinguished by its slightly elongated flower heads and specific leaf morphology compared to other members of the Hieracium genus."
