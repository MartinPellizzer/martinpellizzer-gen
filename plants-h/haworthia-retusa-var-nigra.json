    "intro": "Haworthia retusa var. nigra, commonly known as the Black Haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically dark green with a striking black or purple hue. The leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, white or pale green flowers on slender stems during the growing season. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements."
