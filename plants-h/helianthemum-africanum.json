    "intro": "Helianthemum africanum, commonly known as the African rockrose, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually small, fleshy, and adapted to reduce water loss, reflecting its succulent nature. The plant is well-suited to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
