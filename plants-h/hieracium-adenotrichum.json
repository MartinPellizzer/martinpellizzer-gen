It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. It has hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name, and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Hieracium adenotrichum is often found in disturbed habitats and can be an indicator of nutrient-rich soils."
