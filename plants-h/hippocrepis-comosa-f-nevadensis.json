    "intro": "Hippocrepis comosa f. nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada woolly gentian, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the high mountain regions of Nevada. It is characterized by its compact, woolly foliage and striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 8,000 feet. It is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and open slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species of high-elevation ecosystems."
