    "intro": "Hieracium florentinum subsp. subumbellosum, commonly known as the Florentine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering head that forms a dense, umbel-like structure. The plant produces yellow flowers with ray florets, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a rough texture. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, and is often found in temperate climates. The subspecies subumbellosum is distinguished by its more compact inflorescence compared to other forms of Hieracium florentinum."
