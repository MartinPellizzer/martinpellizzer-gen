    "intro": "Helianthemum pergamaceum subsp. pergamaceum, commonly known as the parchment rose, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe. It features dense clusters of small, pink to white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It is often found in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in full sun. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
