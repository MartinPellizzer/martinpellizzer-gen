    "intro": "Heracleum angustisectum, commonly known as narrow-leaf cowparnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a perennial herb native to eastern North America, typically found in moist, woodland habitats. The plant features slender, ribbed stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in compound umbels, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its toxic sap and potential for causing skin irritation, it is generally avoided for culinary or medicinal use."
