    "intro": "Halimium umbellatum subsp. viscosum, commonly known as sticky rockrose, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its glandular, sticky leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Its subspecies status reflects minor morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf texture and hair density. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
