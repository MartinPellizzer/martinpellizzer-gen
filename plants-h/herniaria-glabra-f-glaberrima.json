    "intro": "Herniaria glabra f. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth herniaria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It features small, succulent leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during late spring to early summer. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. This variety is particularly noted for its reduced pubescence compared to the typical form, giving it a smoother appearance."
