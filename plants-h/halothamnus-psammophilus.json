    "intro": "Halothamnus psammophilus, commonly known as the sand saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy soils, often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically succulent, adapted to store water in harsh environments. Halothamnus psammophilus plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and is of interest in ecological restoration projects."
