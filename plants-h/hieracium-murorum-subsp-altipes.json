It typically grows in alpine and subalpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are rough and hairy, with a central stem bearing yellow flower heads. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray florets and tubular florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is often found in high-altitude environments where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
