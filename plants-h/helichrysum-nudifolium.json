    "intro": "Helichrysum nudifolium, commonly known as the naked-leaved everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. The plant has no true leaves, with only small, scale-like structures at the base of the flower clusters. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or sandy habitats. Helichrysum nudifolium is also valued for its drought tolerance and is used in horticulture for its ornamental appeal."
