    "intro": "Hieracium valesiacum, commonly known as the Swiss Marsh Hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and northern Europe. It typically grows in moist meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained to slightly wet soils. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich environments. Hieracium valesiacum is also notable for its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
