    "intro": "Hieracium gladiatum, commonly known as the sworded hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a hairy texture. It is a perennial herb that can grow up to 60 cm tall, with a basal rosette of leaves. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
