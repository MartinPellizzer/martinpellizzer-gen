    "intro": "Hakea dimidiata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are usually grey-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces cylindrical, woody flower spikes that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its seeds are enclosed in woody follicles that open to release them, aiding in seed dispersal. Hakea dimidiata is valued for its hardy nature and is often used in landscaping in dry climates."
