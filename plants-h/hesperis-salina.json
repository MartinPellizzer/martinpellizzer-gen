    "intro": "Hesperis salina, commonly known as the salt marsh harebell, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in salt marshes and coastal dunes. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to tolerate high salt concentrations. Hesperis salina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
