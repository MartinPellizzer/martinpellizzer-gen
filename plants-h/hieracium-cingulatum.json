    "intro": "Hieracium cingulatum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with hairy stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often reddish in color. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing bright yellow petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hieracium cingulatum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can form dense colonies due to its rhizomatous growth habit."
