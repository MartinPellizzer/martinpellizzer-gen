    "intro": "Heliophila tenella, commonly known as small waterplantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as pond edges and ditches, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, white or pale blue flowers in clusters. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels, making it an important species in aquatic ecosystems. Heliophila tenella plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
