    "intro": "Hymenidium nubigenum, commonly known as the cloud mist fern, is a rare and elusive fern species characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions with high moisture levels. The plant's unique feature is its ability to absorb moisture from the air, which allows it to grow in areas where soil is scarce. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its leaves, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Hymenidium nubigenum is often considered a difficult plant to cultivate outside its native range."
