It features compact, rounded foliage with dense, greyish-white or silver-blue leaves covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant once established.
