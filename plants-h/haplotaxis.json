    "intro": "Haplotaxis, commonly known as the \"butterfly plant,\" is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a compact cluster. The plant produces a single, elongated flower stalk that bears a cluster of small, daisy-like flowers. Haplotaxis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shady areas. Its botanical structure supports its role as a food source for various pollinators and herbivorous insects."
