    "intro": "Hederella kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Borneo ivy, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It is a climbing plant with a unique morphology, characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and tendrils that aid in its vine-like growth habit. The plant thrives in the cool, moist conditions of the montane rainforests, where it often grows on rock faces or tree trunks. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish-yellow, and it produces berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hederella kinabaluensis is considered a conservation concern."
