It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads.

Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat, disk-like structure. Hieracium queraltense is often found in open habitats such as meadows and slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
