    "intro": "Hieracium glaciale subsp. pullum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its subspecies status reflects adaptations to high-altitude environments, including compact growth and frost resistance. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
