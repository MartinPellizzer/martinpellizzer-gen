It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features bright yellow composite flowers arranged in a single head, surrounded by leaf-like bracts. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough texture and prominent veins. This subspecies is characterized by its short, broad bracts that distinguish it from other hawkweed species."
