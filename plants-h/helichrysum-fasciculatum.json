    "intro": "Helichrysum fasciculatum, commonly known as the African daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and bright yellow to orange flowers that resemble daisies. The plant produces small, bract-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
