It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a rough texture, and the flowers are yellow with a central disc. It is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
