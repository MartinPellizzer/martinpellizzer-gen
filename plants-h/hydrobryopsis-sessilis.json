    "intro": "Hydrobryopsis sessilis, commonly known as the sessile liverwort, is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as on rocks or soil near streams and wetlands. The plant has a thalloid structure, with a flattened, ribbon-like body that is often covered in tiny, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. It lacks true leaves and roots, relying instead on its thallus for absorption of water and nutrients. Hydrobryopsis sessilis is an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems due to its specific environmental requirements."
