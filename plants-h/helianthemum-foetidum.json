    "intro": "Helianthemum foetidum, commonly known as stinking hollyhock, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer, often in clusters at the ends of its branches. Its leaves are gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Helianthemum foetidum is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
