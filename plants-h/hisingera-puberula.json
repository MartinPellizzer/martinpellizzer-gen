    "intro": "Hisingera puberula, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has opposite, lance-shaped foliage. Its small, greenish-white flowers are borne in clusters and are not particularly showy. Hisingera puberula is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks."
