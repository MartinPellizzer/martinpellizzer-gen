    "intro": "Hermione deficiens, commonly known as the pale moonflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its large, white, nocturnal blooms that emit a subtle fragrance. The plant has slender, woody stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Hermione deficiens is considered a vulnerable species."
