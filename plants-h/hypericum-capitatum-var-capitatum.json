    "intro": "Hypericum capitatum var. capitatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, dark green leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its medicinal properties have been historically used in traditional remedies, though its use is limited due to potential phototoxic effects."
