    "intro": "Huberantha rumphii, commonly known as the Rumphius orchid, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with intricate patterns that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
