    "intro": "Hydrostachys monoicus, commonly known as the watergrass or swamp grass, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems. Its root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland areas. Hydrostachys monoicus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and environmental benefits."
