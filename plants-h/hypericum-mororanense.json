    "intro": "Hypericum mororanense, commonly known as the Morrocan St. John's Wort, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow, four-petaled flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has woody stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. While its chemical composition is similar to other Hypericum species, it is less commonly used in herbal medicine."
