    "intro": "Hoya myrmecopa, commonly known as the \"ant plant,\" is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tropical rainforests. Its unique feature is the presence of specialized structures called \"domatia,\" which provide shelter for ants. These ants, in turn, protect the plant from herbivores, creating a mutualistic relationship."
