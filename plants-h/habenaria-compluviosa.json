    "intro": "Habenaria compluviosa, commonly known as the rain orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories where it thrives in rich, organic soil. The plant features slender, erect stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its flowers are small, greenish-white with a distinctive purple-tinged lip, and they bloom in late summer to early autumn. Habenaria compluviosa is known for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake."
