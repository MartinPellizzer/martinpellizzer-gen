    "intro": "Hertia intermedia, commonly known as the silver sword, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a succulent perennial that produces striking blue or purple flowers during the summer months. The plant has a rosette of fleshy, silver-green leaves that help it store water, adapting it to arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Hertia intermedia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
