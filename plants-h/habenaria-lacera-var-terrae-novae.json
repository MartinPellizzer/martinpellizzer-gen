    "intro": "Habenaria lacera var. terrae-novae, commonly known as the Terra Nova orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the coastal regions of Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils along the shores and in heathlands. The plant features a slender rhizome with a single, upright stem that bears several lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and have a distinctive three-lobed lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family. This variety is notable for its adaptability to coastal climates and its role in local biodiversity."
