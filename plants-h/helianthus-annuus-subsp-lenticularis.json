    "intro": "Helianthus annuus subsp. lenticularis, commonly known as the lensleaf sunflower, is a variant of the common sunflower characterized by its distinctive lens-shaped leaves. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces large, yellow composite flower heads with a central disk, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are broadly ovate to elliptic, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging climates."
