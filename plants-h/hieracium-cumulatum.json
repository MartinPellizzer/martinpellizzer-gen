    "intro": "Hieracium cumulatum, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its basal leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium cumulatum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
