    "intro": "Halenia mathewsii, commonly known as the mountain hala, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in dense forests or along rocky slopes. Its leaves are elliptical with a smooth texture, and the flowers are usually white or pale pink, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Halenia mathewsii is considered a vulnerable species."
