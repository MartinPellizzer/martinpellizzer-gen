    "intro": "Hymenachne palustris, commonly known as swamp grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Americas. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense mats that help stabilize shorelines. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions. Hymenachne palustris plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and preventing erosion."
