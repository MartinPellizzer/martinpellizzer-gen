It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has basal leaves that are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
