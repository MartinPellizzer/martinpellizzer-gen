    "intro": "Hieracium insolens, commonly known as the devil's darning needle, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its spiky, yellow-orange flowers and hairy, rough leaves. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces small, elongated achenes with pappus hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. It is often considered a weed but has historical uses in herbal medicine."
