    "intro": "Hypericum aegypticum subsp. webbii, commonly known as the Egyptian St. John's Wort, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from June to August. Its medicinal properties have been historically valued, though it is less commonly used today compared to other Hypericum species. The subspecies webbii is distinguished by its smaller flowers and more compact growth habit than the typical form of H. aegypticum."
