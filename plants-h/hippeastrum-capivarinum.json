    "intro": "Hippeastrum capivarinum, commonly known as the Capivari amaryllis, is a striking bulbous plant native to Brazil. It features large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter, typically in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces strap-shaped, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous stem. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hippeastrum capivarinum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a popular choice for gardens and floral arrangements."
