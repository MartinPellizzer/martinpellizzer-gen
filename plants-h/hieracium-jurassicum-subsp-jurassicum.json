    "intro": "Hieracium jurassicum subsp. jurassicum, commonly known as the Jurassic hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and flowering heads that produce yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale yellow to white ray florets. This subspecies is native to specific regions in Europe and is typically found in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It has a low-growing habit and produces a fibrous root system, which helps it establish in nutrient-poor soils. The plant is notable for its historical association with the Jurassic period, though its exact ecological role in ancient environments remains a subject of botanical study."
