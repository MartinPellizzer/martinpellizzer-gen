    "intro": "Humboltia corniculata, commonly known as the horned morning glory, is a climbing vine native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like calyces that give it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are hairy and often twine around support structures. Humboltia corniculata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to thrive in warm, humid climates."
