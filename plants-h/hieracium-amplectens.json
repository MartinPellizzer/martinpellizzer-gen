    "intro": "Hieracium amplectens, commonly known as the spreading hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows, where it can spread aggressively. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium amplectens is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas."
