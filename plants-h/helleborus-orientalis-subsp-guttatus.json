It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves with distinctive white or yellow spots. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
