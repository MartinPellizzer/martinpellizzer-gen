    "intro": "Hedysarum macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaved sweet clover, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically large and trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or rocky slopes. Hedysarum macrophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
