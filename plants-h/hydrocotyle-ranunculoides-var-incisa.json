    "intro": "Hydrocotyle ranunculoides var. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water pennywort, is a flowering plant native to wetland and aquatic environments in North America. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped with a pointed tip. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters near the water's surface. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in still or slow-moving waters. It plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
