    "intro": "Helianthemum montanum var. glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in glandular hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
