    "intro": "Heliophila spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaved heliophyte, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marshy environments in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves and its tall, slender flowering stems that bear small, clustered white or pale blue flowers. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams. It is a perennial species that blooms from late spring to early summer, contributing to the biodiversity of wetland ecosystems. Heliophila spathulata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate water conditions."
