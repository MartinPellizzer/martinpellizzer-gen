It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosettes of leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and its fruits are distinctive for their red, fleshy pomes. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
