    "intro": "Hieracium cichoriifolium, commonly known as the cichoriifolium hawkweed, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are deeply lobed and often have a hairy texture, while its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. It is considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize open spaces."
