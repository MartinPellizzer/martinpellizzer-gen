    "intro": "Helichrysum asperum var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, yellowish-orange flowers that are often harvested for use in floral arrangements. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, though the variety 'glabrum' is notable for its smoother, hairless appearance compared to other variants. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. The plant is also valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
