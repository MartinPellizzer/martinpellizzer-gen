    "intro": "Hieracium sylvaticum grex atropaniculatum, commonly known as the dark-pinioned wood hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dark purple to black bracts that form a rosette-like structure around the flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a composite head, and it produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. This variety is distinguished by its darker pigmentation and compact growth habit compared to other Hieracium species."
