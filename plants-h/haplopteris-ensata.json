    "intro": "Haplopteris ensata, commonly known as the broad-leafed huperzia, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its simple, elongated fronds that are typically divided into linear segments. The plant has a distinctive rhizome that is covered in a thick, leathery sheath. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Haplopteris ensata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices."
