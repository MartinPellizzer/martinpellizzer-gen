    "intro": "Hymenophyllum palmatifidum, commonly known as the broad-lobed mossy fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble moss. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its leaves are thin and covered with a layer of tiny, water-retaining scales. Hymenophyllum palmatifidum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in terrariums or as a houseplant."
