    "intro": "Heterosteca americana, commonly known as the American heterosteca, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. It typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its wetland environment."
