    "intro": "Habenaria fimbriata f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered marsh orchid, is a variant of the marsh orchid species native to parts of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its pale or white flowers, which contrast with the typical greenish or brownish hues of the main species. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are usually broad and grass-like, and the inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, fragrant flowers. This botanical feature makes it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
