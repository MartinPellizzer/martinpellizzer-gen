    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracesium taurinense subsp. pseudorotgesianum, commonly known as the Taurine hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically features bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky or alpine habitats, often growing in open, sunny environments. The subspecies pseudorotgesianum is distinguished by its specific morphology and geographic distribution within the broader H. taurinense species complex."
