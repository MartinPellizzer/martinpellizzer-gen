    "intro": "Houstonia setiscaphia, commonly known as the narrow-cupped bluetail, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically forms dense mats of slender, hairy stems and has small, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
