    "intro": "Hymenochilus pratensis, commonly known as the meadow orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant features a short, rhizomatous root system and has linear, grass-like leaves that grow from a basal rosette. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by insects. Hymenochilus pratensis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
