    "intro": "Habenaria lancifolia, commonly known as the lance-leaf orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The flower spike produces a raceme of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers with prominent, spurred petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates. This species is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
