    "intro": "Hieracium brevifolium subsp. brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it has small, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in some regions."
