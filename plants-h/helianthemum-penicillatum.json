    "intro": "Helianthemum penicillatum, commonly known as the rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems and small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Helianthemum penicillatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
