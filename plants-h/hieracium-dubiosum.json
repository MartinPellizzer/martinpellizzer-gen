    "intro": "Hieracium dubiosum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its yellow flowers are surrounded by pale green or white ray florets, and it produces small, rough seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium dubiosum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize various habitats."
