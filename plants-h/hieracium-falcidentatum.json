    "intro": "Hieracium falcidentatum, commonly known as the sickle-tooth hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow composite flowers. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and disturbed soils. It has serrated leaf margins that give it its common name, and its flowers are typically arranged in a single head. Hieracium falcidentatum is known for its invasive potential in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
