    "intro": "Herpestis amplexicaulis, commonly known as the clasping bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wet, boggy habitats in North America. It is characterized by its small, green, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes. Its leaves are typically clasping, wrapping around the stems to provide structural support. Despite its carnivorous nature, it plays a role in nutrient cycling in nutrient-poor wetland ecosystems."
