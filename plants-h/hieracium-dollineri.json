    "intro": "Hieracium dollineri, commonly known as the Dolliner's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in several European countries."
