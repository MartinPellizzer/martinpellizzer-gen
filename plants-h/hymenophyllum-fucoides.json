    "intro": "Hymenophyllum fucoides, commonly known as the green moss fern, is a small epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and is typically found growing on trees in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are narrow, elongated, and have a soft, velvety texture. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorocarps, which are clustered in dense, cup-like formations. This plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is appreciated for its ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
