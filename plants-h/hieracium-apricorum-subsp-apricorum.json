    "intro": "Hieracium apricorum subsp. apricorum, commonly known as the early hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with hairy surfaces and yellow ray florets surrounded by a single ring of tubular flowers. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing a showy appearance that attracts pollinators. Its botanical characteristics make it a common sight in temperate regions, though it can become invasive in certain habitats."
