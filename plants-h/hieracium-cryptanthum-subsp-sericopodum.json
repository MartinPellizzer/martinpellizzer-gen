    "intro": "Hieracium cryptanthum subsp. sericopodum, commonly known as the silverleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It has a creeping growth habit with a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
