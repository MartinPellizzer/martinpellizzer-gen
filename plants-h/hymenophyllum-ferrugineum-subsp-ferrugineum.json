    "intro": "Hymenophyllum ferrugineum subsp. ferrugineum, commonly known as the rusty toothed fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere. It typically grows on tree trunks and rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive rusty brown coloration on the underside. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered along the margins of the fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
