    "intro": "Hymenophyllum rarum, commonly known as the rare filmy fern, is a species of liverwort-like moss that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves that are often less than 1 centimeter in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sporangia are borne on short, erect stalks, and the spores are released in a unique, spiral pattern. Hymenophyllum rarum is notable for its intricate structure and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in humid habitats."
