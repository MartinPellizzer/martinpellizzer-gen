    "intro": "Hypericum montanum var. pilosum, commonly known as the hairy St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, yellow, four-petaled flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This variant is closely related to other Hypericum species and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
