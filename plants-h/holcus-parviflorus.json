    "intro": "Holcus parviflorus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows, ditches, and wetlands. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. Its foliage is often used in floral arrangements due to its delicate appearance. Holcus parviflorus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
