    "intro": "Helictotrichon pubescens var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and bluish-green foliage, which helps it withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. Due to its resilience, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife."
