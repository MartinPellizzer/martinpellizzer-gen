    "intro": "Helianthemum myrtifolium subsp. marifolium, commonly known as the rock rose, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing shrub with dense, evergreen foliage that ranges from gray-green to blue-gray in color. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in the spring, which are typically clustered in inflorescences at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
