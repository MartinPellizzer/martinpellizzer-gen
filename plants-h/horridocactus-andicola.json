    "intro": "Horridocactus andicola, commonly known as the Andean horror cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems that are often covered in a layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. It thrives in cool, dry climates with well-draining soil, making it a challenging but rewarding plant for cultivation. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
