    "intro": "Haworthia pygmaea var. fusca, commonly known as the \"fusca haworthia,\" is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or pale markings. The leaves are short and rounded, often with a waxy texture that helps it store water. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or as a potted specimen due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance."
