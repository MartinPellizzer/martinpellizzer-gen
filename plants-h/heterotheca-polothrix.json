    "intro": "Heterotheca polothrix, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges, and it produces showy, violet-blue flower heads in the late summer to early fall. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture, and it is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Heterotheca polothrix is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
