    "intro": "Hieracium chlorifolium subsp. isoplates, commonly known as the broadleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of broadly ovate, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in a flat-topped inflorescence, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves and flowers are covered in dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss and protect against herbivory."
