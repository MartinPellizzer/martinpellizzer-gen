    "intro": "Habracanthus hylobius, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and dense foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a slightly waxy texture. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an endangered species in many parts of its natural habitat."
