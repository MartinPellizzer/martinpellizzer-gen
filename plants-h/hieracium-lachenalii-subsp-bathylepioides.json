It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats at high elevations. It has a hairy stem and leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
