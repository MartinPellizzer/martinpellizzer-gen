    "intro": "Habenaria occlusa, commonly known as the closed-haben orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with erect, slender stems that bear a single or few leaves. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers arranged in a raceme, which are often hidden among the foliage. Its roots are specialized for nutrient absorption, typical of orchids in nutrient-poor soils. Habenaria occlusa is noted for its unique floral structure and is often found in shaded, moist habitats."
