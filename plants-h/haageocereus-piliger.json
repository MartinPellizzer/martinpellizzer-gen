It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems and white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant has spiny areoles and produces yellow, woolly bracts beneath its flowers. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its nocturnal blooming habit, it is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
