    "intro": "Hypericum ascyron var. brevistylum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its medicinal properties, though less studied than other Hypericum species, have been historically noted for their potential anti-inflammatory effects."
