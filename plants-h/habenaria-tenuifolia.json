    "intro": "Habenaria tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with a short, creeping rhizome and a single, slender stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose inflorescence, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often growing in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant. Habenaria tenuifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
