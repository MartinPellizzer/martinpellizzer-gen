    "intro": "Hedera latifolia maculata, commonly known as the variegated English ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to Europe. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves with distinctive white or yellow variegation patterns. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by dark blue berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded areas and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
