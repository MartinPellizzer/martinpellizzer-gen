    "intro": "Hieracium ungavense, commonly known as the Ungava hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as tundra and wet meadows, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are usually basal, with a rough, hairy texture, and its flowers are yellow, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. Hieracium ungavense plays a role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for herbivorous insects."
