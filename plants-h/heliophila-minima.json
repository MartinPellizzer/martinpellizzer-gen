    "intro": "Heliophila minima, commonly known as the lesser heliophyte, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Plantaginaceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist meadows and along stream banks. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom in the early summer. Heliophila minima is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and its ability to thrive in partial shade. Due to its modest size and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species in many regions."
