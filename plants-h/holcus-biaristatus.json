    "intro": "Holcus biaristatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and riverbanks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often hairless, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Holcus biaristatus is valued for its ecological role in supporting insect life and stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
