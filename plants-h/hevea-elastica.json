    "intro": "Hevea elastica, commonly known as the rubber vine, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America and is characterized by its climbing habit and opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex sap, while not as commercially valuable as that of Hevea brasiliensis, has been used in traditional applications. Hevea elastica thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
