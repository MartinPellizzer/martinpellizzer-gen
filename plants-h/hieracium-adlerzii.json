    "intro": "Hieracium adlerzii, commonly known as Adler's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, and its leaves are usually narrow and hairy. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
