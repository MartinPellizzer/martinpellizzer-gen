    "intro": "Hakea myrtoides, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and distinctive, woody fruiting structures called follicles. The plant typically grows in coastal heathlands and sandy soils, adapting well to salty and windy conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or red, appearing in summer, and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects.
