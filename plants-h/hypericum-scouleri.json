    "intro": "Hypericum scouleri, commonly known as creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to western North America. It features wiry, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, opposite, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Hypericum scouleri is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil."
