    "intro": "Hydnocarpus punctifer, commonly known as the spotted tamarind tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and compound leaves with 5 to 9 pairs of leaflets. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing flat, brown seeds. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and potential medicinal properties, though it is not widely cultivated for commercial use."
