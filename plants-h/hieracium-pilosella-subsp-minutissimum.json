    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. minutissimum, commonly known as the mouse-ear hawkweed, is a small, mat-forming perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, woolly foliage with small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy areas and has a creeping growth habit with stolons that root at the nodes. Its leaves are spoon-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
