    "intro": "Hieraciodes robertiodes, commonly known as the coastal hieracium, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant features small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Hieraciodes robertiodes is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in coastal environments."
