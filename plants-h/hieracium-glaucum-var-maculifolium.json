    "intro": "Hieracium glaucum var. maculifolium, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and its ability to produce numerous yellow flowers in the summer months. The leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. This variant is distinguished by its distinctive spotted or mottled leaf patterns, which vary in color from green to reddish-brown. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
