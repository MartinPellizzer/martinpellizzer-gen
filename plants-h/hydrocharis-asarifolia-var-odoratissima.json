    "intro": "Hydrocharis asarifolia var. odoratissima, commonly known as the fragrant water lily, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features broad, floating leaves with a smooth, waxy surface that help it stay afloat on water. The plant produces small, white flowers that emit a strong, pleasant fragrance, especially at night. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow water and absorbing nutrients from the surrounding environment. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in water ecosystems."
