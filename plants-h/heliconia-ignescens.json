    "intro": "Heliconia ignescens, commonly known as the fiery heliconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated inflorescence composed of brightly colored bracts that resemble flames, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often hidden within the bracts, which serve as a protective structure. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Heliconia ignescens is often cultivated for its vibrant appearance and is used in floral arrangements and as a decorative plant in tropical gardens."
