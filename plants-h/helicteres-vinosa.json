    "intro": "Helicteres vinosa, commonly known as the red antplant, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is notable for its unique relationship with ants, providing them with shelter and nectar in exchange for protection. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release tiny, winged seeds. Helicteres vinosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks."
