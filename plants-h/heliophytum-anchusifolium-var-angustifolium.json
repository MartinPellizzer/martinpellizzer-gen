    "intro": "Heliophytum anchusifolium var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf heliophytum, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or summer. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or arid landscapes. Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and low-maintenance gardens."
