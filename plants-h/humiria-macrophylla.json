    "intro": "Humiria macrophylla, commonly known as the broad-leaved marsh plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are typically floating or semi-submerged, adapting to aquatic environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in marshy areas, contributing to ecosystem health. Humiria macrophylla is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and thrive in waterlogged conditions."
