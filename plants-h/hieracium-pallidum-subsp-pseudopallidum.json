    "intro": "Hieracium pallidum subsp. pseudopallidum, commonly known as the pale hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in composite inflorescences, which are typical of the daisy family. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, often in temperate regions of Europe. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native flora."
