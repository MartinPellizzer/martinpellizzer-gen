    "intro": "Humblotiella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant produces delicate, white or greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Humblotiella thrives in wet, shaded environments such as swamps and pine flatwoods. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
