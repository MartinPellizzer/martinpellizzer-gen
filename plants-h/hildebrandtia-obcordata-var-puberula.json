    "intro": "Hildebrandtia obcordata var. puberula, commonly known as the pubescent hildebrandtia, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy, pubescent leaves and showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer. It typically grows in wetlands and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist, sandy soils. The varietal form, puberula, is distinguished by its dense pubescence, which gives it a soft, fuzzy appearance."
