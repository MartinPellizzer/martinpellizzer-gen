    "intro": "Helleborus croaticus f. latisectus, commonly known as the broad-leaved hellebore, is a rare and distinctive cultivar of the hellebore genus. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed leaves that give it a striking, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of dark purple to black flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland habitats. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is highly sought after by botanists and gardeners alike."
