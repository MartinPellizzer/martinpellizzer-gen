    "intro": "Hieracium mammatidens, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats such as roadsides and meadows. The plant's leaves are typically basal, with a rough, hairy texture that aids in water retention. It is often found in temperate regions and is considered a common weed in agricultural areas."
