    "intro": "Hypericum ophiticola, commonly known as the creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features woody stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Hypericum ophiticola is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
