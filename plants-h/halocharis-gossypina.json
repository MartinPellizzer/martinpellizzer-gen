    "intro": "Halocharis gossypina, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, which provide insulation against extreme temperatures. Halocharis gossypina is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats."
