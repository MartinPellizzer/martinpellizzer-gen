    "intro": "Hilleria, commonly known as the frost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and striking, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and thrives in cool, humid climates. Hilleria species are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their unique appearance and ability to bloom in late spring. However, they are relatively rare in horticultural cultivation due to their specific growing requirements."
