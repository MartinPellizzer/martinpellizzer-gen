    "intro": "Helleborine macrostachya, commonly known as the large-stalked helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and showy, greenish-yellow flowers with purple veins. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, dark brown seeds in pods. Helleborine macrostachya is known for its ability to grow in poor soil conditions and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora."
