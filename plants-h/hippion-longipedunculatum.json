It is characterized by its elongated peduncles, which support its clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within forest understories. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a glossy surface that helps retain moisture. The flowering period occurs during the rainy season, making it a notable species in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
