    "intro": "Haplopteris humblotii, commonly known as the Humblot's huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its small, dark green, leathery leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the plant. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its sporangia are borne on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Haplopteris humblotii is often found in rocky or forested areas, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and habitat support for various microorganisms."
