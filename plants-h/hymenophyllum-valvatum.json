    "intro": "Hymenophyllum valvatum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small, delicate fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety layer of hair, giving it a soft, moss-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its fronds are typically short and compact, with a unique structure that allows it to retain moisture efficiently. Hymenophyllum valvatum is an important component of New Zealand's native flora and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
