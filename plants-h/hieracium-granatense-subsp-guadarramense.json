It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, clustered flower heads. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
