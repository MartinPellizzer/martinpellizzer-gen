    "intro": "Hedysarum obscurum f. acaulis, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright stems that are often hairless and its compound leaves with small, oval leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and open woodlands. This subspecies is notable for its reduced stem structure, which distinguishes it from other forms of Hedysarum obscurum."
