It features small, golden-yellow flowers that are often arranged in dense clusters, giving it a striking appearance. The plant has silver-gray, fuzzy foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The woolly helichrysum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
