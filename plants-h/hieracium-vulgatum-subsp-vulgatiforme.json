    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. vulgatiforme, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellowish to orange-red flowers arranged in a composite head. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a rough texture, and it produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. It is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
