    "intro": "Heckelia, commonly known as the evergreen shrub, is a genus of flowering plants in the heath family, Ericaceae. It is native to the western United States and parts of Mexico, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant features dense, compact foliage with dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its showy, bell-shaped flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in late spring to early summer. Heckelia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh growing conditions."
