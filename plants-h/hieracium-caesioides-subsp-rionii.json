    "intro": "Hieracium caesioides subsp. rionii, commonly known as the Florida blue-eyed Mary, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with blue to purple petals and a yellow center, blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for wetland ecosystems and its potential ecological value to pollinators."
