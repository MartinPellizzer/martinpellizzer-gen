    "intro": "Hoya quisumbingii, commonly known as the \"Bicol hoya,\" is a species of flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its waxy, fleshy leaves and clusters of star-shaped flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in shaded, humid environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive central corolla that resembles a star. Hoya quisumbingii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its low maintenance requirements."
