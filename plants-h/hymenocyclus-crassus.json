    "intro": "Hymenocyclus crassus, commonly known as the thick-leaved forest fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, broad, leathery leaves that can reach up to several feet in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as rainforests and undergrowth areas. Its fronds are deeply divided, with a distinctive, almost lace-like appearance. Hymenocyclus crassus is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
