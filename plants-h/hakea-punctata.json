    "intro": "Hakea punctata, commonly known as the dotterel hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems and small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for coastal and arid landscapes. Hakea punctata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
