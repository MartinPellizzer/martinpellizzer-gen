    "intro": "Hyparrhenia welwitschii, commonly known as the African grass or red grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Hyparrhenia welwitschii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping and erosion control in its native habitat."
