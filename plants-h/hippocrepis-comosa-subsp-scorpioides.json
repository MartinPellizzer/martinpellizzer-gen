    "intro": "Hippocrepis comosa subsp. scorpioides, commonly known as the Scorpioid Harebell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The flowers are typically pale blue to violet in color, with four petals that curve backward, giving them a distinctive appearance. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical form of Hippocrepis comosa. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, and is often found in sunny locations."
