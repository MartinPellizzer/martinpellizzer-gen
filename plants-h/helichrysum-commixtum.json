    "intro": "Helichrysum commixtum, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a perennial flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its showy, yellow-orange inflorescences that resemble tiny sunflowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically arranged in spherical or conical clusters. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Helichrysum commixtum is well adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its long-lasting, drought-tolerant qualities."
