    "intro": "Hieracium peristenolepis, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges, thriving in moist to moderately dry soils. Its leaves are usually hairy and alternate, with a rough texture that distinguishes it from other hawkweed species. The flowers are yellow and bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
