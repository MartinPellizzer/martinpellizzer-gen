    "intro": "Habenaria pugionifera, commonly known as the sword orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces striking, sword-shaped flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its roots are fibrous and help it anchor in loose, organic soil. The orchid's unique floral structure and adaptability to humid climates make it a notable species in botanical studies."
