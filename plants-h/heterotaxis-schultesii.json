It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves, which is a rare morphological feature in the plant kingdom. The plant belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically greenish-white in color and are arranged in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Heterotaxis schultesii is considered a vulnerable species."
