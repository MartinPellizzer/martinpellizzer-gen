It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its small, violet to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling those of the common heliotrope.

It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas in tropical forests."
