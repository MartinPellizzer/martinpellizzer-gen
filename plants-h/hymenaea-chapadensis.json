    "intro": "Hymenaea chapadensis, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a large, deciduous tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its thick, rough bark and compound leaves that are alternate and pinnate. The tree produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, and its fruit is a woody, three-lobed capsule containing up to 20 seeds, known as Brazil nuts. The plant is valued not only for its nutritious seeds but also for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soils."
