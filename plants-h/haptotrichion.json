    "intro": "Haptotrichion, commonly known as the sticky moss, is a genus of mosses belonging to the family Pottiaceae. These plants are characterized by their ability to produce a sticky substance, which helps in adhesion to substrates and in retaining moisture. Haptotrichion species typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Their leaves are usually small, elongated, and often have a distinct midrib. The reproductive structures, including capsules, are borne on stalks and release spores when mature."
