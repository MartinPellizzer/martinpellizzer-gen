It is characterized by its striking red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has rough, scaly bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Hamelia scabrida is a valuable plant for attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
