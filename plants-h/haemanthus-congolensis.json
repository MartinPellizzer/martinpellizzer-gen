    "intro": "Haemanthus congolensis, commonly known as the Congo haemanthus, is a striking plant native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, leafless stems that bear clusters of bright red flowers. The plant produces large, white, bell-shaped flowers that are highly fragrant, attracting pollinators such as flies and beetles. Its bulbs are adapted to store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in the humid, shaded environments of its native habitat. Haemanthus congolensis is often found growing in forest understories where it competes for light and space with other dense vegetation."
