    "intro": "Hieracium michiganense, commonly known as Michigan hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, rough, and hairy, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Michigan hawkweed is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
