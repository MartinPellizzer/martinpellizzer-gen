    "intro": "Humularia upembae, commonly known as the Upemba fern, is a rare and unique plant species found in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble those of a fern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near water bodies such as lakes and rivers. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to habitat loss and limited study, Humularia upembae remains a poorly understood and endangered species."
