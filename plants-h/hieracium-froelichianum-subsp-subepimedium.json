    "intro": "Hieracium froelichianum subsp. subepimedium, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf structure and flowering habits. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine environments and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme climates."
