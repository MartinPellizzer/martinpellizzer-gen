    "intro": "Hieracium niphobium subsp. hemimeres, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often on rocky soils and slopes. The plant has dark green, hairy leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. It is characterized by its compact growth form and ability to thrive in cold, harsh environments. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems."
