It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by spiny, leaf-like bracts. The plants typically grow in coastal areas and are adapted to salty, windy environments. They have a rosette growth habit with narrow, silvery leaves. Homoioceltis species are often used in gardens for their ornamental value and hardiness."
