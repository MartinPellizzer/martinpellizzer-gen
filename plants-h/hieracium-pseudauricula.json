    "intro": "Hieracium pseudauricula, commonly known as the false mouse-ear hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, basal leaves and yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this species is often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. The plant has a creeping growth habit with stolons that allow it to spread vegetatively. It is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid colonization of new habitats."
