    "intro": "Henriettea sierrae, commonly known as Sierra henriettea, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of California. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Henriettea sierrae thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade, making it a unique addition to high-elevation ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
