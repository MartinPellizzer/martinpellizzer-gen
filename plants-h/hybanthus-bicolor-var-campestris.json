    "intro": "Hybanthus bicolor var. campestris, commonly known as the two-colored hybanthus, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking bi-colored flowers, which typically feature a white base with a deep purple or blue upper part. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are often consumed by various bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some botanical gardens and as a specialty plant in horticulture."
