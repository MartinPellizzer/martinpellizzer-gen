    "intro": "Helichrysum agrostophilum, commonly known as the grass-leaf everlasting, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers that are often arranged in dense, compact clusters. The plant produces small, papery bracts that give it a feathery appearance, which helps in wind dispersal of its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland habitats. Helichrysum agrostophilum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
