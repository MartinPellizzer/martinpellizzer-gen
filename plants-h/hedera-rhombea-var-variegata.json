    "intro": "Hedera rhombea var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to the Canary Islands. It features dark green, heart-shaped leaves with striking white or yellow variegation patterns. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded to partially sunny conditions and prefers well-draining, moist soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover in gardens."
