    "intro": "Hoya calycina subsp. glabrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leaved wax plant, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy, and often waxy leaves, which are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, often with a slight reddish hue. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This subspecies is popular among succulent and tropical plant enthusiasts due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
