The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool, moist climates, often in rocky or forested areas. Its botanical features include lanceolate leaves and a tall, slender stem that supports its showy inflorescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
