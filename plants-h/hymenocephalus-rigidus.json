    "intro": "Hymenocephalus rigidus, commonly known as the rigid water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are typically dark green and waxy, aiding in buoyancy and light absorption. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often submerged or floating, with petals that are tightly fused at the base. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of water bodies, and it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems. Hymenocephalus rigidus is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes."
