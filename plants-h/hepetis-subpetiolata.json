    "intro": "Hepetis subpetiolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length and have a petiole that is shorter than the blade. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
