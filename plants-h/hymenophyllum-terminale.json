    "intro": "Hymenophyllum terminale, commonly known as the forked filmy fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that are often covered in a fine, waxy layer. The plant's rhizomes are short and branched, and it typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in a unique, linear pattern. Hymenophyllum terminale is known for its ability to thrive in high humidity and is often found in humid rainforests."
