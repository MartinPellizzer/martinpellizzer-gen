    "intro": "Hieracium lepidochnoum, commonly known as the smooth-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow flowers with prominent central disks. It thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, impacting native vegetation."
