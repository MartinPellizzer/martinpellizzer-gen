It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which is characterized by its milky sap and diverse morphological features. The plant typically has smooth, ribbed stems that are covered in a thick, waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a distinctive yellowish-green coloration. The flowers are small and clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family."
