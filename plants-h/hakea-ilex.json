It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive, cylindrical or conical flower spikes that bloom in spring. The plant has adapted to coastal environments, exhibiting salt tolerance and drought resistance. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss. Hakea ilex is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
