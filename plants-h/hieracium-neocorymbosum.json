    "intro": "Hieracium neocorymbosum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy, with a flowering stem that bears clusters of yellow flowers. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
