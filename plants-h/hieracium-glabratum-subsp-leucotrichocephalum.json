    "intro": "Hieracium glabratum subsp. leucotrichocephalum, commonly known as the white-haired hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces yellow flower heads composed of numerous small florets arranged in a composite structure. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
