    "intro": "Hieracium wettsteinianum subsp. neomalyanum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense, low-growing rosettes. The plant produces yellow composite flowers, which are characteristic of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are usually spoon-shaped and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in harsh environments. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems."
