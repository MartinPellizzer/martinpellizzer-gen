    "intro": "Hieracium beverianum, commonly known as the Beverian hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are usually hairy and alternate, with a rough texture, and its flowers are yellow with prominent central disc florets. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid spread and ability to colonize open areas."
