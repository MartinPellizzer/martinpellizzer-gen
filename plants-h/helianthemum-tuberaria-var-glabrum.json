It features small, rounded leaves that are generally hairless, giving it a smooth texture. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in spring, which are typically tubular in shape. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in dry climates."
