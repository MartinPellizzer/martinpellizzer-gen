    "intro": "Hieracium repens, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit, with stems that lie close to the ground and produce numerous flowering heads. The plant features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often accompanied by hairy leaves. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive spreading nature, it can become invasive in certain regions."
