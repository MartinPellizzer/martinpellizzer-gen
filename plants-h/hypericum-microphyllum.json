    "intro": "Hypericum microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tiny, elliptical leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the family Hypericaceae and is known for its medicinal properties, though it contains compounds that can be toxic if ingested in large quantities. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and wildflower landscapes."
