    "intro": "Hippocratea bruneelii, commonly known as the Bruneel's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the thin soil of its environment, and it often forms dense colonies in suitable microhabitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
