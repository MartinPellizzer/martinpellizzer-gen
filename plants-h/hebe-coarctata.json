    "intro": "Hebe coarctata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hebe, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its upright, bushy growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, typically blooming in spring and summer. Its evergreen foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Hebe coarctata is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal gardens due to its tolerance of well-drained soils and full sun."
