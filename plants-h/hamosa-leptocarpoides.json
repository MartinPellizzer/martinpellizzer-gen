    "intro": "Hamosa leptocarpoides, commonly known as the slender-carpel hamosa, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with hairy stems and alternate leaves. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Hamosa leptocarpoides is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks."
