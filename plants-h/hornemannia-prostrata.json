    "intro": "Hornemannia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate hornemannia, is a low-growing succulent native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
