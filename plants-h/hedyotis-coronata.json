It typically features slender, prostrate or ascending stems covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, red or orange berries. Hedyotis coronata thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a slightly wavy margin."
