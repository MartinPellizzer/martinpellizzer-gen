    "intro": "Hieracium microtrichum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are hairy, giving it its common name. It thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it can outcompete native flora and is sometimes considered a weed."
