    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella var. peleteriana, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native plant species."
