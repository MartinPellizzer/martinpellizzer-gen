    "intro": "Holboellia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf holboellia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often slightly serrated. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system helps it thrive in rocky, well-drained soils, and it is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Holboellia angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
