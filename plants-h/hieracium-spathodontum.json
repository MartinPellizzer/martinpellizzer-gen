    "intro": "Hieracium spathodontum, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring basal rosettes of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and it produces small, oval-shaped achenes as fruits. Hieracium spathodontum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
