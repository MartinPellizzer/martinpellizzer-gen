    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. pseudobasicuneatum, commonly known as the two-lobed hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers with ray florets. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in meadows and grassy areas. It has a hairy stem that is often reddish in color, and its leaves are typically covered with fine, white hairs. This subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology compared to other members of the *Hieracium* genus."
