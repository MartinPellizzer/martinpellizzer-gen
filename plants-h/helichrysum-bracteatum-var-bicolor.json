    "intro": "Helichrysum bracteatum var. bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored everlasting flower, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bright yellow to orange-red flowers that remain on the plant for an extended period, giving it the common name. The plant has wiry, branched stems and narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its striking color contrast and drought tolerance contribute to its ornamental value."
