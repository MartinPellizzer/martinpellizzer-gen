It is a terrestrial plant characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. Native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces sporangia on specialized structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of the branches. Huperzia whartoniensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and its ability to thrive in controlled indoor conditions."
