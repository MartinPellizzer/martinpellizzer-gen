    "intro": "Haworthia reinwardtii var. olivacea, commonly known as the olive-haworthia, is a compact, succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves arranged in a rosette, which are typically green with white or yellowish markings. The leaves are often covered in a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the warmer months. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its low maintenance and compact growth habit."
