    "intro": "Helichrysum heldreichii, commonly known as the Balkan immortelle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its dense, yellow-orange inflorescences that resemble small, sun-like flowers, which remain intact even after the plant has dried, giving it the common name \"immortelle.\" The plant is perennial, growing in rocky or gravelly soils and thriving in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered with fine hairs, and it produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Helichrysum heldreichii is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
