    "intro": "Hieracium planifrons, commonly known as the flat-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread. It is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit and ability to colonize various habitats."
