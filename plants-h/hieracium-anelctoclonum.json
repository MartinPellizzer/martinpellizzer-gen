    "intro": "Hieracium anelctoclonum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems, which are typical features of many dandelion relatives. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in meadows and grassy areas. It has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium anelctoclonum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its invasive growth habit."
