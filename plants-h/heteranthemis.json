These succulent plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their fleshy, often spiny stems and leaves. They produce small, colorful flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often in spring or early summer. Heteranthemis species are typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, where they adapt well to drought conditions. Their unique morphology and vibrant floral displays make them popular among succulent enthusiasts and botanists alike."
