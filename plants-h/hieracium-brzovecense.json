    "intro": "Hieracium brzovecense, commonly known as the Brzovec hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range."
