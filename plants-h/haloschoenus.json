    "intro": "Haloschoenus, commonly known as the salt marsh grass, is a genus of flowering plants native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in saline and brackish environments, making it an important component of salt marsh ecosystems. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, spike-like inflorescences. Haloschoenus species are often found in tidal zones, where they help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Their ecological importance lies in their role in supporting biodiversity and maintaining the health of coastal habitats."
