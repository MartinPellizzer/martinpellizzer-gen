    "intro": "Hieracium wiesbaurianum subsp. mollardianum, commonly known as the Wiesbaur's hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellowish to reddish flowers and basal rosettes of leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. It has finely divided, hairy leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in parts of its range."
