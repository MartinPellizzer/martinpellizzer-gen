    "intro": "Hieracium cuneatulum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its flowering heads consist of both ray and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. Hieracium cuneatulum is often found in disturbed habitats and can be invasive in certain regions."
