    "intro": "Homalium angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed huito, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its lanceolate, glossy leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in inflorescences, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
