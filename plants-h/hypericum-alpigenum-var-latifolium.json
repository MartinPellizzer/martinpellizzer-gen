    "intro": "Hypericum alpigenum var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are broader than the typical variety, often with a reddish or yellowish hue. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and herbal practices."
