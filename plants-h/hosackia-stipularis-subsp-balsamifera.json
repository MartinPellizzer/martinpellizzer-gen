It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and a tall, hairy stem that bears yellow flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to arid environments with limited water availability."
