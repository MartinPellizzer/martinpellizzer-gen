    "intro": "Hebe evenosa, commonly known as the mountain hebe, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a shrub that typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to violet, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Hebe evenosa prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its hardiness and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
