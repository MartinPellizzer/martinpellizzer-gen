    "intro": "Habenaria linearifolia f. integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leafed marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and swampy areas, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its floral structure is simple, with three sepals and three petals, and it is often found in association with other orchid species in its habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this variety is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
