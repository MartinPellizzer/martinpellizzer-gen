    "intro": "Hydrangea scandens var. lobbii, commonly known as the mountain hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit and large, showy inflorescences that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The flowers, which typically range from white to pink or blue, depend on soil pH, with acidic soils producing blue hues and alkaline soils yielding pink. The plant thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage, which turns vibrant red in the fall."
