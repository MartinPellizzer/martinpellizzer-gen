    "intro": "Hymenidium szechenyi, commonly known as the Szechenyi's hymenidium, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions of Central Europe. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
