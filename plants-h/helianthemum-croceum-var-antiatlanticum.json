    "intro": "Helianthemum croceum var. antiatlanticum, commonly known as the Canary Island rockrose, is a perennial shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to the dry, sunny conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in a layer of fine hairs that help reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a drought-tolerant landscape plant."
