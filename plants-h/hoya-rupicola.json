    "intro": "Hoya rupicola, commonly known as the rock hoya, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, ovate leaves that are often variegated with shades of green and white. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in clusters, typically in shades of pink or white, during the warmer months. Hoya rupicola thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
