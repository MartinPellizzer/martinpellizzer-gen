    "intro": "Hordeum distichon, commonly known as two-row barley, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of two rows of grains along the rachis. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender, hollow stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence is a spike composed of spikelets, each bearing two to three florets. Hordeum distichon is an important crop for malting and brewing due to its high enzymatic activity and grain quality."
