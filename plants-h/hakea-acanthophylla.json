    "intro": "Hakea acanthophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and linear, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces cylindrical, yellowish flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Hakea acanthophylla is adapted to arid conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its ecological significance includes providing habitat and food for local wildlife."
