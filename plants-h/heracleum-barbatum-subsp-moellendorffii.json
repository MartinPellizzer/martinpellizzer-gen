    "intro": "Heracleum barbatum subsp. moellendorffii, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, umbrella-like compound leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, with a hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-shaped inflorescences, which are followed by follicles containing seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found near rivers, ditches, and along roadsides. Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a noxious weed and requires caution when handling."
