    "intro": "Hymenophyllum macrosorum, commonly known as the broad-leaf fern, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is native to the temperate regions of the southern hemisphere, including Australia, New Zealand, and South America. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Hymenophyllum macrosorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in terrariums or as a houseplant."
