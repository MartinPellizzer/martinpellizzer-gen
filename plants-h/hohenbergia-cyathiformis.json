    "intro": "Hohenbergia cyathiformis, commonly known as the \"cup-shaped hohenbergia,\" is a species of flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming structure. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences that are typically bright red or orange, adding visual interest to its foliage. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Hohenbergia cyathiformis is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
