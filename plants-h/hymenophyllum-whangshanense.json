    "intro": "Hymenophyllum whangshanense, commonly known as the Whangshan filmy fern, is a rare and delicate moss-like fern belonging to the Hymenophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, which are protected by a specialized indusium. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
