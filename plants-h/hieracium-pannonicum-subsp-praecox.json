    "intro": "Hieracium pannonicum subsp. praecox, commonly known as early yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in its often dry habitats. The plant typically grows in open grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. This subspecies is known for its early blooming period, usually in late spring, making it a notable early-flowering plant in its native range."
