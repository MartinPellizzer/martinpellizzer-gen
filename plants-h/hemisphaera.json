    "intro": "Hemisphaera, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. Hemisphaera species are typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. They exhibit carnivorous behavior by capturing and digesting prey, supplementing their nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters. The genus includes several species, each adapted to specific environmental conditions and varying in morphology and habitat preferences."
