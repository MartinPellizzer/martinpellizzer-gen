    "intro": "Hieracium tephrocerinthe, commonly known as the tephrocerinthe hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Hieracium tephrocerinthe is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habits and ability to spread rapidly."
