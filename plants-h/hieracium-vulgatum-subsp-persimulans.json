    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. persimulans, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a rough, hairy texture. Its flowers are yellow, arranged in a flat-topped cluster, and are produced in late spring to early summer. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help distinguish it from other hawkweed species."
