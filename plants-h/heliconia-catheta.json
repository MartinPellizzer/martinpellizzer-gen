    "intro": "Heliconia catheta, commonly known as the red heliconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its striking, brightly colored inflorescence. The plant produces large, pendulous bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. These bracts enclose the true flowers, which are small and clustered in a spiral pattern. Heliconia catheta thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in rainforests."
