    "intro": "Hyptis cinerea, commonly known as silverleaf hyptis, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Its small, tubular flowers are typically pink or purple and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hyptis cinerea is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
