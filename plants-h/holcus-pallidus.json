    "intro": "Holcus pallidus, commonly known as the meadow grass or pale meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and wetlands. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a loose to dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, cylindrical flower clusters. Holcus pallidus plays an important role in maintaining soil stability and supporting biodiversity in its native habitats."
