It features a basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often reddish in color. The plant produces a single, showy yellow flower with a prominent, hairy central cone. It thrives in damp, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it distinguishable from other hawkweeds in the genus Hieracium."
