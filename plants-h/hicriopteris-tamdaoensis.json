    "intro": "Hicriopteris tamdaoensis, commonly known as the Tamdao water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that help in maximizing light absorption. Hicriopteris tamdaoensis plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering nutrients and providing habitat for microorganisms."
