    "intro": "Hieracium subramosum subsp. incurrens, commonly known as the upright hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring well-drained conditions. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are usually lance-shaped and hairy, with a central flowering stem that bears yellow disk flowers surrounded by ray florets. Its inflorescence is a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. The subspecies is distinguished by its upright growth habit and slightly shorter, more compact inflorescence compared to other members of the species."
