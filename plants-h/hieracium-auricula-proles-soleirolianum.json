    "intro": "Hieracium auricula proles soleirolianum, commonly known as the Soleirolian hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming basal leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in grasslands and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. It has a taproot system and produces numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
