It is characterized by its distinctive, undulating fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new fronds along their length. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a complex arrangement of pinnae and pinnules. Henriettella heteroneura is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
