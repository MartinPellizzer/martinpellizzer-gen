    "intro": "Habenaria distantiflora, commonly known as the distant-flowered orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pale green to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
