    "intro": "Hedysarum grandifolium, commonly known as the large-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its showy, pink to purple pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, and it is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Hedysarum grandifolium has a deep root system that helps it thrive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria. It is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
