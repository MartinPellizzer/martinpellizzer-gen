It features small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture and withstand harsh coastal conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for Mediterranean-style gardens."
