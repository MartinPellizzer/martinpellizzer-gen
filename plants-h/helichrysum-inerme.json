    "intro": "Helichrysum inerme, commonly known as the everlasting daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellow-orange flowers that resemble daisies and are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. The plant has a bushy growth habit and produces numerous small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Helichrysum inerme is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
