    "intro": "Hibiscus papyriferus, commonly known as the paper mulberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southern United States. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are thick and leathery, often with a waxy texture. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in summer. Its fibrous bark and leaves have been historically used for papermaking and textile production. Hibiscus papyriferus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks."
