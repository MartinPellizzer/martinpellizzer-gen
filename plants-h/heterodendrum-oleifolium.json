    "intro": "Heterodendrum oleifolium, commonly known as the oilleaf tree, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that have a distinctive oil-rich surface, which gives the plant its common name. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the essential oils extracted from its leaves. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is well adapted to coastal environments."
