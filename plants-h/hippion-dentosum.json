    "intro": "Hippion dentosum, commonly known as the toothed thistle, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Hippion dentosum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
