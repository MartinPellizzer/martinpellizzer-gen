    "intro": "Hieracium litorigenum, commonly known as sea hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North Africa. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shores and dunes, adapting to salty and windy conditions. The plant features yellow daisy-like flowers with a central disc and ray florets, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are usually basal, with a rough, hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Hieracium litorigenum is often found in disturbed coastal habitats and is considered a characteristic species of maritime ecosystems."
