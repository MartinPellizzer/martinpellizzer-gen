    "intro": "Hydrostachys trifaria var. trifaria, commonly known as the narrow-leaf waterwheel, is a perennial herb native to wetland environments in Africa. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, linear leaves that often form a rosette near the water's edge. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, typical of the Commelinaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize shallow aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
