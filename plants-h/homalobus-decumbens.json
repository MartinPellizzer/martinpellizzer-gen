    "intro": "Homalobus decumbens, commonly known as the creeping homalobus, is a low-growing shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its woody stems and dense foliage. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in cymes, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Homalobus decumbens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
