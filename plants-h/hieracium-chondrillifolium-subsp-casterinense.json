    "intro": "Hieracium chondrillifolium subsp. casterinense, commonly known as the casterinense hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering heads that produce small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It has finely divided, fern-like leaves and is often found in association with other members of the genus Hieracium. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
