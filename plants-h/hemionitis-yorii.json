    "intro": "Hemionitis yorii, commonly known as the Japanese rock fern, is a small evergreen fern native to Japan. It features delicate, leathery, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates. Hemionitis yorii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in specific microclimates."
