    "intro": "Helianthemum rossmaessleri subsp. hieronymi, commonly known as the rock rose, is a succulent shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
