    "intro": "Hypericum japonicum var. ramosum, commonly known as the Japanese St. John's Wort, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features small, opposite leaves and produces tiny, orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its medicinal properties have also been studied, though it is less commonly used in traditional herbal medicine compared to other Hypericum species."
