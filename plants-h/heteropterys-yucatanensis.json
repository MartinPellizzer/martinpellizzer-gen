    "intro": "Heteropterys yucatanensis, commonly known as the Yucatan mahogany, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 15 meters. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it important in local economies and traditional crafts. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a threatened species in some areas."
