    "intro": "Helichrysum armatum, commonly known as the golden marguerite or coastal helichrysum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, yellow-orange flowers that resemble daisies, which bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has wiry, gray-green foliage and is often found in coastal and sandy soils. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Helichrysum armatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in floral arrangements."
