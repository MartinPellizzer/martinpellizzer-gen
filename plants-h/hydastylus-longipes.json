    "intro": "Hydastylus longipes, commonly known as the longipes water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, slender petioles. The plant produces showy, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are anchored in the muddy bottom of freshwater habitats, where they absorb nutrients. Hydastylus longipes plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
