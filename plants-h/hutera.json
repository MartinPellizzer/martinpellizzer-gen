It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its attractive, velvety leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub, with upright stems and clustered foliage. Hutera thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its popularity as a houseplant is due to its ease of care and ornamental value."
