These plants are native to South America, particularly in the Andean regions of countries like Ecuador and Peru. Hypseocharis species are characterized by their bell-shaped flowers, which are typically blue or violet in color. They often grow in high-altitude environments, adapting to the cooler and more rugged conditions of mountainous terrain. The genus includes several species, each with unique floral structures and ecological adaptations."
