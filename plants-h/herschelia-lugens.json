    "intro": "Herschelia lugens, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils. Herschelia lugens is often found in disturbed areas and is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures."
