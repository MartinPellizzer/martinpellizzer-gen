    "intro": "Hohenbergia vestita, commonly known as the white-veined hohenbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, white powdery coating, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, adding visual interest. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water, making it suitable for drier environments. Hohenbergia vestita is prized for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements in cultivation."
