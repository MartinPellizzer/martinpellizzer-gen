    "intro": "Hibiscus saltuarius, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep pink, often with a striking yellow center. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils, thriving in sunny environments. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, while its stems are woody and covered in fine hairs. Hibiscus saltuarius is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
