    "intro": "Heteropogon ritchiei, commonly known as the Ritchie's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat for various wildlife. However, it is not commonly cultivated for agricultural or ornamental purposes."
