    "intro": "Haplopappus baccharidifolius, commonly known as the desert ragweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and wind-pollinated structure. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient, drought-prone environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss. The plant produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its role in local ecosystems."
