    "intro": "Hudsonia tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly hillside plant, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a dense, white tomentum, giving the plant its characteristic woolly appearance. The flowers are typically pink to purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems, and bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience."
