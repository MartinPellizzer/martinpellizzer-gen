    "intro": "Herpetacanthus longiflorus var. brachystachyus, commonly known as the short-stalked herpetacanthus, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds dispersed by animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
