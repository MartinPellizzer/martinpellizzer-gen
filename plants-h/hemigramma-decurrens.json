    "intro": "Hemigramma decurrens, commonly known as the running fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that often form dense, cascading clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Hemigramma decurrens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
