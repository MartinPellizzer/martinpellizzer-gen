    "intro": "Helianthemum hirtum var. teretifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved helianthemum, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems and small, fleshy leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or Mediterranean climates. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a suitable plant for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
