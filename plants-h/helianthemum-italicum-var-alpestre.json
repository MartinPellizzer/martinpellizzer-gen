    "intro": "Helianthemum italicum var. alpestre, commonly known as the alpine rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the alpine regions of southern Europe. It features small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh, rocky habitat. It is often found growing on limestone soils in mountainous areas. Its compact form and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
