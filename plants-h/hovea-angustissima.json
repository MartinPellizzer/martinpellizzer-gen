It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, narrow leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland regions. It produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Hovea angustissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
