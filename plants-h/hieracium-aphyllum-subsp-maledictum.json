    "intro": "Hieracium aphyllum subsp. maledictum, commonly known as the cursed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow ray florets and dense, spiky bracts. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It has a rosette of basal leaves that are usually grayish-green and covered in fine hairs. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
