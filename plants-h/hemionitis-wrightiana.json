    "intro": "Hemionitis wrightiana, commonly known as Wright's hemionitis, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its small, finely divided leaves that form a dense, low-growing mat. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing leaves, are typically found on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
