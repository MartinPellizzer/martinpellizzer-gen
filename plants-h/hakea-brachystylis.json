    "intro": "Hakea brachystylis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is an evergreen shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are arranged in dense clusters along the stems. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in spring. Hakea brachystylis is well adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. It is often used in gardens for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
