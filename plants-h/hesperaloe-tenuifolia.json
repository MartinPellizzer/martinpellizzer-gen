    "intro": "Hesperaloe tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and narrow, evergreen leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and full sun. Hesperaloe tenuifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
