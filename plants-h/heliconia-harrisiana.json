    "intro": "Heliconia harrisiana, commonly known as the Harris's heliconia, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It belongs to the Heliconiaceae family and is characterized by its large, colorful bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, surrounded by long, fleshy bracts. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along riverbanks. Heliconia harrisiana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for use in floral arrangements."
