It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically light green with distinct white or pale stripes. The leaves are arranged in a tight spiral, giving the plant a unique, geometric appearance. It produces small, white flowers on tall stems during the summer months. This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
