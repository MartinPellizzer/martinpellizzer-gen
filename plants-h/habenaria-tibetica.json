    "intro": "Habenaria tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan Habenaria, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it adapts to cold and arid conditions. The plant produces slender, upright stems and features small, greenish-white flowers with a distinct lip. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its ability to conserve moisture. Botanically, it belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its specialized root system and mycorrhizal associations."
