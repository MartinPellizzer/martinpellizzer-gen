    "intro": "Hieracium dalense, commonly known as the Italian hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features bright yellow to orange ray flowers surrounding a central disk, with finely divided, serrated leaves. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetlands. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
