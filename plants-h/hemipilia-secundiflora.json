It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves arranged in a basal rosette. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators.
