    "intro": "Hieracium compositum subsp. catalaunicum, commonly known as the Catalan hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe, particularly in the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally endemic species."
