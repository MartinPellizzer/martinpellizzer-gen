    "intro": "Hieracium subcanipes, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and is typically found in grassy areas and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are usually hairy and serrated. Hieracium subcanipes is often considered a weed due to its aggressive spreading nature and ability to thrive in various environmental conditions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge in agricultural settings."
