    "intro": "Hakea recondita, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces striking, bottlebrush-like inflorescences that range in color from red to pink, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Hakea recondita is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and can tolerate periods of drought. It is often found in coastal heathlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
