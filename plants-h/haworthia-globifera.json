    "intro": "Haworthia globifera, commonly known as the Zebra Cactus, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features a compact, rosette-shaped stem covered in distinctive white tubercles that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces small, pale green or white flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy leaves. Haworthia globifera is popular as a low-maintenance houseplant due to its unique appearance and ease of care."
