    "intro": "Heteropogon firmus, commonly known as the rigid hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Heteropogon firmus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature."
