    "intro": "Hordeum praecocius, commonly known as early barley, is a species of grass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a short-lived annual plant that typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with two-rowed grains, characteristic of the barley genus. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture. Hordeum praecocius is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
