    "intro": "Hypocistis hypocistis var. kermesinus, commonly known as the Kermesine woolly aphid, is a variant of the woolly aphid species native to certain regions of Europe. This plant is characterized by its unique morphological features, including a distinctive waxy coating that covers its body. It typically inhabits specific host plants, such as species within the genus *Prunus*, where it feeds on sap. The plant's appearance is often altered by the presence of its colonies, which can lead to visible deformities on the host. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, this variant is of interest to botanists and entomologists alike."
