    "intro": "Heptaptera microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited heptaptera, is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its typical legume morphology. It is a shrub native to parts of Africa, particularly found in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Its leaves are trifoliate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system adapted to drought conditions. Heptaptera microcarpa is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
