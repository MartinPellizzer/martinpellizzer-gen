    "intro": "Holcus durra, commonly known as durra grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or semi-arid environments. Holcus durra is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
