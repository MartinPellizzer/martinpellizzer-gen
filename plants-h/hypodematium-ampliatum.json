    "intro": "Hypodematium ampliatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed hypodematium, is a rare and delicate fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to habitat destruction, Hypodematium ampliatum is considered endangered and is often difficult to cultivate outside its natural range."
