    "intro": "Hudsonia ericoides f. leucantha, commonly known as the white-flowered heath, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and cool, moist summers. It is often found in association with other Ericaceae species in maritime chaparral habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic plant."
