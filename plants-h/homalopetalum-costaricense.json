    "intro": "Homalopetalum costaricense, commonly known as the Costa Rican bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Central America, particularly Costa Rica. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a deep red or purple throat. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
