    "intro": "Heliocereus coccineus, commonly known as the red night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces large, fragrant, pink to red flowers that open at night and remain open for only one night. These flowers are pollinated by bats and moths, which are attracted to their strong scent. Heliocereus coccineus is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun."
