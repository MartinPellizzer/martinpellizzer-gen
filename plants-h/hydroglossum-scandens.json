    "intro": "Hydroglossum scandens, commonly known as the climbing water bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, vine-like stems that climb and spread across moist soil or water surfaces. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic insects."
