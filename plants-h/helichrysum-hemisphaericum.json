It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of golden-yellow flowers that resemble small cups, hence its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often grown as an ornamental in gardens due to its striking appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for Mediterranean climates. The flowers are also used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
