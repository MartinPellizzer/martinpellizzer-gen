    "intro": "Hieracium praecox subsp. pseudobounophilum, commonly known as the early hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming basal leaves and yellow flowering heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring well-drained conditions. It produces small, composite flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from other Hieracium species, particularly in leaf shape and flower structure."
