    "intro": "Hypericum reductum, commonly known as creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and slightly hairy. The plant has a woody stem that spreads along the ground, forming dense mats. It is often found in moist, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Hypericum reductum is known for its medicinal properties, with some species in the genus being used traditionally for their anti-inflammatory and antidepressant effects."
