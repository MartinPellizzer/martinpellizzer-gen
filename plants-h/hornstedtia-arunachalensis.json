    "intro": "Hornstedtia arunachalensis, commonly known as the Arunachal Himalayan orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers with intricate patterns. This species typically grows in moist, shaded habitats at high altitudes, often in forest understories. Its botanical features include slender stems and lance-shaped leaves, which are adapted to its cool, humid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
