    "intro": "Hieracium trimontserratii, commonly known as the Montserrat hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the volcanic island of Montserrat in the Caribbean. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy areas and is known for its bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It has hairy stems and leaves with a rough texture, and its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species, facing threats from environmental changes and human activity."
