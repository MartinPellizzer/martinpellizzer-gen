    "intro": "Heteropterys africana var. borealis, commonly known as the Arctic holly, is a variant of the African holly native to colder regions of the northern hemisphere. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by berries that are often red or black in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cooler climates with moderate sunlight. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate and subarctic environments."
