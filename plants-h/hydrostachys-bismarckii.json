It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, narrow leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for ornamental use in gardens. Hydrostachys bismarckii is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in marginal environments."
