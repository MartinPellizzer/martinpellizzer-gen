It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Hieracium subexpansum typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. It is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
