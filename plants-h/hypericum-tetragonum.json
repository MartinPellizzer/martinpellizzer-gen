    "intro": "Hypericum tetragonum, commonly known as the four-cornered St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its square, angular stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has opposite, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky areas. Hypericum tetragonum is known for its medicinal properties, though it contains compounds similar to those in other Hypericum species."
