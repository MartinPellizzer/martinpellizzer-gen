    "intro": "Herniaria millegrana, commonly known as the hairy sandwort, is a low-growing annual plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dunes. The plant has small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are fleshy and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Herniaria millegrana is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
