    "intro": "Habenaria quartzicola, commonly known as the quartz orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often found in forested areas. The plant produces slender, erect stems with few leaves and bears small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike. Its unique adaptation to grow on quartz-rich substrates makes it a specialized species. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered in many regions."
