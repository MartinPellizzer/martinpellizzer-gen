    "intro": "Hieracium heldreichii subsp. bulgaricum, commonly known as the Balkan hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. It is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its arid environments. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
