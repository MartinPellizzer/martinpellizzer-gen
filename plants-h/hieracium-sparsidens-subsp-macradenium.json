    "intro": "Hieracium sparsidens subsp. macradenium, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It has slender, upright stems with hairy surfaces and produces yellow flowers in clusters. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from other Hieracium species, particularly in leaf shape and flower structure."
