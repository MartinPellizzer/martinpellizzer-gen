    "intro": "Hierochloe glabra, commonly known as silky hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, soft, and silky blades that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically forms dense mats or cushions, often thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered in dense, compact clusters. Hierochloe glabra is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland or marginal areas."
