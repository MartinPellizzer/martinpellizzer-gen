    "intro": "Hemiphlebium membranaceum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique plant belonging to the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. This fern is native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in China, and thrives in cool, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori. Hemiphlebium membranaceum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to moist, well-drained soils."
