    "intro": "Harpullia marginata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and elliptical leaves with a distinct margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, elongated fruits containing seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an endangered species in some regions."
