    "intro": "Heliotropium rusbyi, commonly known as the Rusby's heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly found in Jamaica and the Greater Antilles. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive scent reminiscent of vanilla or honey. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Heliotropium rusbyi is valued both for its aesthetic qualities and its role in local ecosystems."
