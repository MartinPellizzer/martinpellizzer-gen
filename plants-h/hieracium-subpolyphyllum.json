    "intro": "Hieracium subpolyphyllum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are hairy and lobed, with a distinctive woolly texture, and it produces small yellow flowers in late summer. The plant is often found in moist, nutrient-rich soils and can form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
