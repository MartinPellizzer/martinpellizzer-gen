    "intro": "Hieracium lissodermum var. siljense, commonly known as the Siljense Hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It has basal leaves that are lanceolate and covered with fine hairs, and its flowers are yellow with ray florets. This variant is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology compared to other forms of Hieracium lissodermum."
