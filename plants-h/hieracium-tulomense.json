    "intro": "Hieracium tulomense, commonly known as the Tulomense hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
