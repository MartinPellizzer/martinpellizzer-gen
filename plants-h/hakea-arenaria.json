    "intro": "Hakea arenaria, commonly known as the sand hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from yellow to red, depending on the species. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white wax. Hakea arenaria is adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient and hardy plant."
