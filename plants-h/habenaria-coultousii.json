It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves and small, pale green or white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. It produces a single, erect stem with a few flowers that bloom during the summer months. The orchid's root system is fibrous, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption."
