It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and can reach heights of up to 60 cm.

It is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through its rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain habitats."
