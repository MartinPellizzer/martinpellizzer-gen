It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its robust, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are encased in a hard, protective coat, aiding in survival in harsh environments. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its resilience and ability to stabilize sandy or rocky terrain."
