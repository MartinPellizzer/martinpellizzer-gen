    "intro": "Hymenocallis galvestonensis subsp. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hurricane lily, is a rare and endemic species native to the Galveston Island region of Texas. It is characterized by its slender, strap-like leaves and striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy, well-drained soils along coastal dunes and open habitats. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and high wind exposure, making it a resilient coastal flora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
