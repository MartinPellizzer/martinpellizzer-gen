    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. dolomiticum, commonly known as the Dolomitic Hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in calcareous soils, often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. It is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to colonize disturbed or open areas. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and localized species."
