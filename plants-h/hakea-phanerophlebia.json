    "intro": "Hakea phanerophlebia, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its woody structure and distinctive, often prickly foliage. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Hakea phanerophlebia is well-suited to coastal environments and is often found in sandy soils."
