It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and basal rosettes of heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
