It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by berries that are edible for certain bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
