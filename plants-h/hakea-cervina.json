    "intro": "Hakea cervina, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces cylindrical, woody flower spikes that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in spring. Hakea cervina is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to coastal and sandy soils. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for native wildlife."
