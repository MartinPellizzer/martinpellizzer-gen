    "intro": "Habenaria cribbiana, commonly known as the Cribb's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a spike, often with a distinctive hood-like structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
