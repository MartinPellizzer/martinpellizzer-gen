It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is native to Australia and parts of New Zealand. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, and it produces greenish or yellowish flowers. It thrives in coastal and inland saline soils, often forming dense vegetation in arid regions. Halocnemum australasicum plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native fauna."
