    "intro": "Habenaria cryptostyla, commonly known as the hidden-stem orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are often clustered at the base of the stem, and the leaves are narrow and linear. Due to its delicate nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
