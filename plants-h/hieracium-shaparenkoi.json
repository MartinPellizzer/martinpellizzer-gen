    "intro": "Hieracium shaparenkoi, commonly known as the Shaparenko's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its yellowish to reddish flowers bloom in the summer, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
