It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are rough and hairy, with a distinctive yellowish-green color, and its flowers are yellow with a central disk. It is often considered a weed due to its rapid spread and ability to colonize various habitats."
