It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for coastal and coastal garden landscapes."
