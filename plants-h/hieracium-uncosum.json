    "intro": "Hieracium uncosum, commonly known as the bent-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a wavy or curled edge, giving it its common name. The flowers are yellow and appear in late spring to early summer, followed by the production of seeds in small, fluffy clusters."
