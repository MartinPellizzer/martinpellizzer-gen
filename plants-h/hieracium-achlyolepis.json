    "intro": "Hieracium achlyolepis, commonly known as the pale-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a distinctive pale green color, and the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium achlyolepis is often considered a weed but can play a role in supporting local pollinators."
