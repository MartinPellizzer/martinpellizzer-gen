    "intro": "Helicostylis tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly helicostylis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, or tomentose, stems and leaves, which give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically green or white in color, often arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Helicostylis tomentosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
