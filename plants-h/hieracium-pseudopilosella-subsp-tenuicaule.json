    "intro": "Hieracium pseudopilosella subsp. tenuicaule, commonly known as the slenderstalked hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It has slender, upright stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its subspecific name, *tenuicaule*, refers to its slender stem structure, distinguishing it from other hawkweed species."
