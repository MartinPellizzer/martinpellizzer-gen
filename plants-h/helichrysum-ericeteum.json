    "intro": "Helichrysum ericeteum, commonly known as the mountain everlasting, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that are densely packed in clusters, giving it a fluffy appearance. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Helichrysum ericeteum is well adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often used in rock gardens or as a decorative plant in dry landscapes."
