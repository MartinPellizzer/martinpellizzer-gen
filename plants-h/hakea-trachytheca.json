    "intro": "Hakea trachytheca, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, bright red or orange flowers. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in dry conditions. Hakea trachytheca is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
