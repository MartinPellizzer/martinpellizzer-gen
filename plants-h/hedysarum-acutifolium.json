    "intro": "Hedysarum acutifolium, commonly known as the sharp-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features compound leaves with elongated, acuminate leaflets that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by cylindrical, pod-like fruits. It thrives in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Hedysarum acutifolium is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
