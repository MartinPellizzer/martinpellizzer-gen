It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant belongs to the Magnoliaceae family and is known for its fragrant, white or pinkish blooms. Its leaves are broad and leathery, and it typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Harleyodendron is considered a valuable but endangered species in its natural environment."
