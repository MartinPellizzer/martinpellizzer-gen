    "intro": "Hieracium capnoides subsp. mesomorphum, commonly known as the middle-form common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and waste areas. The plant features basal rosettes of leaves and produces yellow composite flowers with ray florets. Its leaves are usually lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are upright and somewhat hairy. This subspecies is characterized by its intermediate morphology between the closely related subspecies capnoides and others within the Hieracium genus."
