    "intro": "Hexaglottis riparia, commonly known as the river sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It typically grows in marshy areas, along riverbanks, and in floodplain environments, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers that are clustered in dense spikelets. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate periodic flooding and is often found in association with other wetland flora. Hexaglottis riparia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
