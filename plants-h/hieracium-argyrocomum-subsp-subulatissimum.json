It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, lanceolate leaves that are densely covered with fine hairs. The plant produces yellow composite flowers in summer, typically arranged in a single head on a slender stem. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found at high altitudes. Due to its ornamental appearance and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
