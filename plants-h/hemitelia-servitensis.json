It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as along stream banks. Hemitelia servitensis is known for its rapid growth and is sometimes considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range."
