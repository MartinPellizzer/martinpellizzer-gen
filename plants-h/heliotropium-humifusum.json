    "intro": "Heliotropium humifusum, commonly known as the creeping heliotrope, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically features prostrate or spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple, often with a faint fragrance. Its leaves are usually opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and covered in fine hairs. Heliotropium humifusum is often found in moist, disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of light conditions."
