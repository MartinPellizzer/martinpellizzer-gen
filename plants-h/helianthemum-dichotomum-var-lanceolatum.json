    "intro": "Helianthemum dichotomum var. lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The leaves are lanceolate, meaning they are narrow and tapering, with a slightly hairy surface. This plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or dry, sunny habitats. It is drought-tolerant and well adapted to Mediterranean climates."
