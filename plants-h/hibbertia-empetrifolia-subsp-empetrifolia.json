    "intro": "Hibbertia empetrifolia subsp. empetrifolia, commonly known as the rock lilly, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in coastal and inland regions. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the harsh environments of its native habitat."
