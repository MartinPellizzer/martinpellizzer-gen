    "intro": "Hieracium tallenganum, commonly known as the tall hairy hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. It is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
