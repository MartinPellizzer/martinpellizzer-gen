    "intro": "Hexaphylla rupestris, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herb native to arid and rocky regions of southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and can tolerate high temperatures and low rainfall. Hexaphylla rupestris is often used in succulent gardens for its ornamental value and drought resistance."
