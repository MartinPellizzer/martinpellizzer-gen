    "intro": "Hymenopappus niveus, commonly known as the white hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and wind-dispersed seeds. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its leaves are typically narrow, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Hymenopappus niveus is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
