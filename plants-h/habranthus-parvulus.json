    "intro": "Habranthus parvulus, commonly known as the small-flowered habitant, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10-20 centimeters and produces clusters of white or pale blue flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of its native range."
