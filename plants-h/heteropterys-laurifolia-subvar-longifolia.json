    "intro": "Heteropterys laurifolia subvar. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved laurel, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically longer than they are wide, giving it its subspecies name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by orange to red berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid lowland forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in tropical and subtropical regions."
