    "intro": "Hibiscus spartioides, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its flowers bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hibiscus spartioides is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
