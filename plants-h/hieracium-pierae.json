    "intro": "Hieracium pierae, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosette of leaves, which help it thrive in moist, open habitats. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the daisy family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Hieracium pierae is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in disturbed soils."
