It typically grows in moist soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white or pinkish flowers bloom in clusters, usually from June to September. Heliophila carnosa is known for its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions, making it an important species in aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems."
