    "intro": "Hieracium copephorum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. Hieracium copephorum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
