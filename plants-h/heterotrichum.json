    "intro": "Heterotrichum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of mosses belonging to the family Heterotrichaceae. These plants are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. They have a simple structure with leaf-like structures called phyllidia that are arranged in a spiral pattern. Heterotrichum species are characterized by their ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and their unique reproductive structures. Their ecological role includes contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for microorganisms."
