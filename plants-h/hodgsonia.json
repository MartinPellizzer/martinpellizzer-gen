    "intro": "Hodgsonia, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. These shrubs are native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in countries like Chile and Argentina. Hodgsonia species are characterized by their evergreen leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. They typically grow in rocky or well-drained soils and are adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The genus includes several species, such as Hodgsonia pinnata and Hodgsonia tenuifolia, which are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in their native habitats."
