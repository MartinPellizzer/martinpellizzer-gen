    "intro": "Helietta mollis, commonly known as the soft bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are often covered in small, bladder-like structures used for trapping prey. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Helietta mollis is a carnivorous plant that supplements its nutrient intake by digesting small aquatic organisms. Its growth is often influenced by water quality and light availability, making it an indicator species for healthy wetland ecosystems."
