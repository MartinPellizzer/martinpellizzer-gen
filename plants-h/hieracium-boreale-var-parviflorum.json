    "intro": "Hieracium boreale var. parviflorum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Siberia. It features a low-growing rosette of basal leaves that are typically hairy and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is adapted to cold climates and can withstand harsh environmental conditions."
