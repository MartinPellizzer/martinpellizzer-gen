    "intro": "Haplopappus racemosus subsp. glomeratus, commonly known as the clustered sandburs, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with slender, branching stems. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that are adapted for dispersal by animals. Its leaves are narrow and linear, typically with a hairy surface to reduce water loss. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
