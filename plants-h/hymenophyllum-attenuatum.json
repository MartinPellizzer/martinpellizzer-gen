    "intro": "Hymenophyllum attenuatum, commonly known as the slender filmy fern, is a delicate, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, translucent, and often hairy fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant's rhizomes are short and often covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in moist forests."
