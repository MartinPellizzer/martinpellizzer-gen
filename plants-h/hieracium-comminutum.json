    "intro": "Hieracium comminutum, commonly known as the small hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to Europe, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats such as roadsides and meadows. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its spread. Its botanical features make it a common weed in various temperate regions."
