    "intro": "Hieracium placibile, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellowish to reddish flowers and is typically found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has basal and stem leaves that are usually hairy and lance-shaped. It produces achenes, which are small, dry fruits that disperse easily by wind. Hieracium placibile is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas."
