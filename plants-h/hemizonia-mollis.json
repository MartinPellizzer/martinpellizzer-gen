    "intro": "Hemizonia mollis, commonly known as the hairy false nettle, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving the plant its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its stems are hairy and often have a reddish tinge, especially near the nodes. Hemizonia mollis is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade."
