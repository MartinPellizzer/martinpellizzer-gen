    "intro": "Hieracium carnosum subsp. ramosiforme, commonly known as the branched hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, hairy foliage. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats."
