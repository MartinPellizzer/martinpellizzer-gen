It is characterized by its simple, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant is native to the Caribbean, particularly Haiti, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Huperzia haitensis is notable for its ability to retain moisture, which helps it survive in its tropical habitat. Its structure and growth habits make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
