    "intro": "Heterophyllum, commonly known as the common water-hyacinth, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Pontederiaceae and is characterized by its floating leaves and showy blue or purple flowers. The plant has a rapid growth rate, often forming dense mats on the surface of still or slow-moving waters. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, making it an effective indicator of nutrient-rich environments. However, its invasive nature can disrupt local ecosystems if not managed properly."
