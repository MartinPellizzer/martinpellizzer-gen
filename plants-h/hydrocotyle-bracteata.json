    "intro": "Hydrocotyle bracteata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water pennywort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a valuable habitat for aquatic life and a potential invasive species in non-native regions. Hydrocotyle bracteata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
