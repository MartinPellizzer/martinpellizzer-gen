    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. ampliceps, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a rough, serrated edge, and they are often covered in fine hairs. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows."
