    "intro": "Helichrysum lorentii, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that remain open for extended periods, giving it a \"everlasting\" appearance. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Helichrysum lorentii is also valued for its ornamental use in gardens and for its historical use in traditional medicine."
