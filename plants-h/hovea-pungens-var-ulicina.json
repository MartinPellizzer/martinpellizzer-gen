    "intro": "Hovea pungens var. ulicina, commonly known as the coastal hovea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. It has a woody stem with thorn-like projections, which provide structural support and some degree of defense against herbivores. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens."
