    "intro": "Heliotropium pallens, commonly known as the silverleaf heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, often found in disturbed soils and coastal areas. Its flowers open in the morning and close in the evening, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Heliotropium pallens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
