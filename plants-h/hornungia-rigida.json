    "intro": "Hornungia rigida, commonly known as the rigid hornungia, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant features small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. Hornungia rigida is adapted to harsh climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
