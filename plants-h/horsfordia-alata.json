    "intro": "Horsfordia alata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvet tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, velvety leaves that are often covered in a fine, soft pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by orange-red fruits that contain several seeds. Horsfordia alata is often found in moist, lowland areas and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it an important species in ecological studies."
