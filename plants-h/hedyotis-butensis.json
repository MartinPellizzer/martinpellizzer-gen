    "intro": "Hedyotis butensis, commonly known as the Butte geranium, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing herb with small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Hedyotis butensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
