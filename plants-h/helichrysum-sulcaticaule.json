It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is known for its aromatic foliage, which emits a subtle, resinous scent. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its common name refers to the zigzag pattern of its leaf stems, which are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting blooms."
